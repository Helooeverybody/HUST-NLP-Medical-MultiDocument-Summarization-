      "This prospective, randomized study compared the functional outcome and complications associated with a proximal femoral nail antirotation (PFNA) device with those of a traditional extramedullary device, the dynamic hip screw (DHS), in patients with trochanteric fracture. A total of 121 patients were randomized to the PFNA group (n = 58) or the DHS group (n = 63). Perioperative information and complications were recorded, and assessments of functional outcome were made. The DHS group required a longer operative time and was associated with greater blood loss than the PFNA group. The re-operation rate was lower in the PFNA group compared with the DHS group, especially in patients with unstable fractures, although there was no statistically significant difference in the overall complication rate between the two groups. There were no significant differences in functional outcome between the PFNA and the DHS groups. In conclusion, the PFNA device is useful in the treatment of trochanteric fractures.\n",

There was no difference in the length of hospital stay but the level of mobility recovered was significantly better in the Ambi group at 6 months follow up. Urine retention was the most frequent complication but did not correlate with the implant or method of anaesthesia. Two implants cut out, one in each group.

There was no difference in failure of proximal fixation: cut-out occurred in three cases with the DHS, and twice with the Gamma nail.

Clinical and radiological outcomes were similar, but the gamma nail was associated with a higher incidence of complications, in particular fracture of the femur below the implant in eight cases.

      "\n",
      "We compared the outcome of patients treated for an intertrochanteric fracture of the femoral neck with a locked, long intramedullary nail with those treated with a dynamic hip screw (DHS) in a prospective randomised study. Each patient who presented with an extra-capsular hip fracture was randomised to operative stabilisation with either a long intramedullary Holland nail or a DHS. We treated 92 patients with a Holland nail and 98 with a DHS. Pre-operative variables included the Mini Mental test score, patient mobility, fracture pattern and American Society of Anesthesiologists grading. Peri-operative variables were anaesthetic time, operating time, radiation time and blood loss. Post-operative variables were time to mobilising with a frame, wound infection, time to discharge, time to fracture union, and mortality. We found no significant difference in the pre-operative variables. The mean anaesthetic and operation times were shorter in the DHS group than in the Holland nail group (29.7 vs 40.4 minutes, p < 0.001; and 40.3 vs 54 minutes, p < 0.001, respectively). There was an increased mean blood loss within the DHS group versus the Holland nail group (160 ml vs 78 ml, respectively, p < 0.001). The mean time to mobilisation with a frame was shorter in the Holland nail group (DHS 4.3 days, Holland nail 3.6 days, p = 0.012). More patients needed a post-operative blood transfusion in the DHS group (23 vs seven, p = 0.003) and the mean radiation time was shorter in this group (DHS 0.9 minutes vs Holland nail 1.56 minutes, p < 0.001). The screw of the DHS cut out in two patients, one of whom underwent revision to a Holland nail. There were no revisions in the Holland nail group. All fractures in both groups were united when followed up after one year. We conclude that the DHS can be implanted more quickly and with less exposure to radiation than the Holland nail. However, the resultant blood loss and need for transfusion is greater. The Holland nail allows patients to mobilise faster and to a greater extent. We have therefore adopted the Holland nail as our preferred method of treating intertrochanteric fractures of the hip.\n",

No significant differences between the two study groups were observed with regard to treatment and follow-up data. With the Classic-Nail one complete femur shaft fracture and one incomplete fracture occurred at the tip of the nail intraoperatively and could successfully be fixed with cerclage wires. In the DHS group two patients underwent reoperation for significant loss of reduction early postoperatively. At an average follow-up of 3.7 months all fractures were healed with no difference in functional outcome between the two groups.--Classic Nail and DHS both lead to equally good results in the operative treatment of trochanteric femur fractures.\n",

There were no differences in intraoperative blood loss, medical complications, mortality or length of hospital stay. Major fracture complications occurred twiceas often in the TGN group compared with the DHS group, however they were not statistically significant. Any potential for the TGN leading to a less invasive procedure and a more rapid postoperative mobilisation could not be demonstrated. Compared with the TGN we prefer the DHS for most intertrochanteric fractures in a setting where the majority of these fractures are treated by younger doctors and not by highly specialized hip/trauma surgeons.

The operation time for the GAPN group was shorter than for the CHS group and the intraoperative blood loss was lower. The Gamma AP nail enabled earlier mobilisation. We found no significant difference in the time to union and the length of sliding of the lag screw between the two groups. The decrease in the neck shaft angle in the Gamma nail group was significantly smaller than in the CHS patients. There were no significant mechanical complications, such as fracture of the femoral shaft or failure of fixation in the Gamma nail group.

      "One hundred elderly patients who had an intertrochanteric femoral fracture were randomized to treatment with a compression hip-screw with a plate (fifty patients) or a new intramedullary device, the intramedullary hip-screw (fifty patients). All patients were followed prospectively for one year or until death. A detailed assessment of the functional status and the plain radiographs of the hip was performed one, three, six, and twelve months postoperatively. The two treatment groups were strictly comparable. The operative time needed to insert the intramedullary hip-screw was significantly greater than that needed to insert the compression hip-screw with the plate (p = 0.02), but use of the intramedullary hip-screw was associated with less estimated intraoperative blood loss (p = 0.011). The prevalence of perioperative complications, such as bronchopneumonia, cardiac failure, and urinary tract infection, was comparable in the two treatment groups. There were one intraoperative fracture of the femoral shaft and two intraoperative fractures of the greater trochanter in the group managed with the intramedullary hip-screw. One patient had pulling-out of the compression hip-screw on the seventh postoperative day. Four patients had a trochanteric wound hematoma, without infection, after insertion of an intramedullary hip-screw. All but one of the fractures healed. The one non-union, which was in a patient who had a compression hip-screw, was treated with a hemiarthroplasty. The mortality rate was similar in the two treatment groups. The patients who had an intramedullary hip-screw had, on the average, significantly better mobility at one (p < 0.0001) and three months (p = 0.0013) postoperatively. This difference was no longer seen at six and twelve months, although the patients who had an intramedullary hip-screw still had significantly better walking ability outside the home at those time-periods (p = 0.05). The compression hip-screw was removed from two patients because of pain in the mid-portion of the thigh, which had begun after consolidation of the fracture. Fourteen patients who had an intramedullary hip-screw had cortical hypertrophy at the level of the tip of the nail at twelve months postoperatively. Cortical hypertrophy was significantly related to the use of two interlocking screws (p = 0.02). Six of these patients also had pain in the mid-portion of the thigh, and the nail had been locked with two screws in five of them. Three of the six patients had the hardware removed because of the pain, and the symptoms resolved. A seventh patient had pain without cortical hypertrophy. The intramedullary hip-screw device was associated with significantly less sliding of the lag-screw and subsequent shortening of the limb in the region of the thigh (p = 0.012 and 0.019, respectively); these differences were more pronounced when the unstable fractures in the two treatment groups were compared (p < 0.001).\n",

Gamma nails were implanted with significantly shorter screening times, smaller incisions, and less intraoperative bleeding. The Gamma nail group had a shorter convalescence and earlier full weight-bearing, but there was no significant difference in mortality within six months, postoperative mobility, or hip function at review. More intra-operative complications were recorded in the Gamma nail group, mainly due to the mismatching of the femoral component of the nail to the small femurs of Chinese people. Use of a smaller modified nail reduced these complications. We conclude that with careful surgical technique and the modified femoral component, the Gamma nail is an advance in the treatment of peritrochanteric fractures.\n",

We noted: patient status (ASA classification), operative data (type of implant, duration), postoperative data (blood loss, radiographic findings, early complications), and outcome (Harris score, time to walking, mortality). All patients were assessed three months after surgery. The series included 60 patients, 14 men (23%) and 46 women (77%). The Targon PF nail was used for 34 patients and the DHS for 26.

At three months, mechanical complications involved migration of the cervical screw outside the femoral head for three Targon PF fixations and for two DHS fixations. Screw migration was favored by fracture instability and presence of osteoporosis. There were two deaths in the intramedullary nailing group and one in the screw-plate group.

      "In a prospective randomised trial between September 1989 and June 1990 one hundred patients with per- and subtrochanteric fractures were consecutively treated by gamma-nail or DHS. The average age of both groups was about 80 years. The operation time for gamma-nailing was longer than for DHS implantation and also the postoperative blood loss was higher in the gamma-nail group. We found no difference of intraoperative blood loss, of perioperative lethality and in duration of hospital care. 90% of gamma-nail patients and 80% of DHS patients were successfully able to walk four days after operation with full weight bearing on the operated limb. Three patients in the DHS group with unstable fractures got cranial perforation of the cephalic screw mobilisation. Five patients of the gamma-nail group were reoperated, one case because of missed distal locking, one because of cranial perforation of the cephalic screw after varus dislocation of the proximal fragment. One patient suffered intraoperatively a proximal femur shaft fracture which was corrected during operation. In one case a wound hematoma was evacuated, an other patient needed secondary wound closure. Despite technical imperfection of implant and instruments, we conclude that the gamma-nail allows a very high percentage early and full weight bearing immediately after operation. So we consider that in the treatment of unstable pertrochanteric fractures of geriatric patients, the gamma-nail has proven to be more efficient than the DHS.\n",

      "Achieving bony union and early weight bearing in peritrochanteric femur fractures poses a continuous challenge for the orthopedic surgeon. Current standards of surgical fixation for the myriad possible fracture patterns include the compression hip screw (CHS), the 90 degrees/95 degrees blade plate, and locked intramedullary nails. The gamma nail (GN) was designed as a \"hybrid\" of these devices, combining theoretical biomechanical advantages that should allow earlier postoperative weight bearing with surgical technique advantages that should decrease operative morbidity. Because these theoretical advantages were unproven in a clinical setting, we prospectively randomized 75 consecutive patients with peritrochanteric femur fractures into two groups to examine the fixation of these fractures with the GN as compared to the CHS. We found no significant differences in preoperative or intraoperative parameters. Postoperatively, the subtrochanteric fracture group treated with the GN achieved earlier weightbearing status, although this was not statistically significant. 72 patients were available for follow-up at a minimum of 6 months. All fractures had clinically and radiographically healed, and 94% of the patients continued to be ambulatory. Major complications included missed distal locking screws (one patient), cutting out of the lag screw superiorly in the femoral head (two patients), and a femur fracture at the distal end of the GN (one patient). In our series, the GN produced clinical results commensurate with current standards of fixation for peritrochanteric femur fractures. Although the GN allowed earlier independent weightbearing status in patients with subtrochanteric fractures, the procedure was technically more demanding and had a significant learning curve.\n",

The results show no difference in operating time (P = 0.21), but the Trochanteric Gamma nail group had a significantly shorter fluoroscopy time (P = 0.006), and the number of patients transfused and the mean of units of blood transfused were significantly less in the Trochanteric Gamma nail group (P = 0.013, 0.046, respectively). Mortality within 12 months was similar in both groups (P = 0.83). All fractures were radiographically healed at the last visit. There was no difference in intraoperative and postoperative complications or rate of fixation failure between the 2 groups, and no case of secondary shaft fracture of the femur was encountered in this study. In the entire series, there was no difference in the functional outcome (P = 0.74), but the postoperative walking ability was better in those patients with unstable fractures who were treated with the Trochanteric Gamma nail (P = 0.017).\n",
      "                The new Trochanteric Gamma nail is an effective method for the treatment of trochanteric femoral fractures in elderly patients. The indication for either Trochanteric Gamma nail or compression hip screw is similar in stable fractures, but we recommend the use of the Trochanteric Gamma nail for unstable trochanteric fractures.\n",

      "The standard Gamma nail or the Medoff sliding plate for unstable trochanteric and subtrochanteric fractures. A randomised, controlled trial.\n",
      "\n",
      "We studied 217 patients with an unstable trochanteric or subtrochanteric fracture who had been randomly allocated to treatment by either internal fixation with a standard Gamma nail (SGN) or a Medoff sliding plate (MSP, biaxial dynamisation mode). Their mean age was 84 years (65 to 99) and they were reviewed at four and 12 months after surgery. Assessments of outcome included general complications, technical failures, revision surgery, activities of daily living (ADL), hip function (Charnley score) and the health-related quality of life (HRQOL, EQ-5D). The rate of technical failure in patients with unstable trochanteric fractures was 6.5% (6/93) (including intra-operative femoral fractures) in the SGN group and 5.2% (5/96) in the MSP group. In patients with subtrochanteric fractures, there were no failures in the SGN group (n = 16) and two in the MSP group (n = 12). In the SGN group, there were intra-operative femoral fractures in 2.8% (3/109) and no post-operative fractures. There was a reduced need for revision surgery in the SGN group compared with the MSP group (8.3%; 9/108; p = 0.072). The SGN group also showed a lower incidence of severe general complications (p < 0.05) and a trend towards a lower incidence of wound infections (p = 0.05). There were no differences between the groups regarding the outcome of ADL, hip function or the HRQOL. The reduction in the HRQOL (EQ-5D(index) score) was significant in both groups compared with that before the fracture (p < 0.005). Our findings indicate that the SGN showed good results in both trochanteric and subtrochanteric fractures. The limited number of intra-operative femoral fractures did not influence the outcome or the need for revision surgery. Moreover, the SGN group had a reduced number of serious general complications and wound infections compared with the MSP group. The MSP in the biaxial dynamisation mode had a low rate of failure in trochanteric fractures but an unacceptably high rate when used in the biaxial dynamisation mode in subtrochanteric fractures. The negative influence of an unstable trochanteric or subtrochanteric fracture on the quality of life was significant regardless of the surgical method.\n",

In the blade plate group, we noticed three femoral head necrosis without major flattening, two non-unions, one plate's breakage and two malunions; fracture healing is acquired at 6.3 months. The two non-unions and the plate's breakage didn't need reoperation because of low functional demand.\n",

The use of the sliding screw also resulted in a higher proportion of 1-year survivors regaining their prefracture level of mobility.
