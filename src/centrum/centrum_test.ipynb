         "Fetal lung maturation: the combined use of corticosteroids and thyrotropin-releasing hormone.<doc-sep>The purpose of this randomized study was to evaluate whether the combined use of corticosteroids and thyrotropin-releasing hormone would enhance fetal lung maturation to a greater degree than would corticosteroids alone. The study was restricted to patients under 34 weeks' gestation with a lecithin/sphingomyelin (L/S) ratio less than 2.0. The patients were randomized into a study group receiving intravenous thyrotropin-releasing hormone along with intramuscular corticosteroids over 48 hours and a control group receiving only corticosteroids. Patients undelivered 1 week after the onset of therapy underwent a repeat amniocentesis to document changes in the L/S ratio. In those patients delivering within 1 week of therapy, the neonatal clinical course was established by two investigators blinded to the antenatal therapy. Compared with the control group, the group receiving antenatal corticosteroids plus thyrotropin-releasing hormone showed a greater post-therapy increase in L/S ratio, fewer respirator days, and a lower incidence of bronchopulmonary dysplasia. The results of this study suggest that the combined use of corticosteroids and thyrotropin-releasing hormone results in enhanced fetal pulmonic maturation superior to that achieved with corticosteroids alone.<doc-sep>Combined hormonal therapy for the prevention of respiratory distress syndrome and its consequences.<doc-sep>In performing this meta-analysis, we have attempted to use comparable data, but there are limitations to the information that is available at present. Some studies reported results for all patients entered, whereas others reported only optimally treated patients (Table 2). Many of the trials have not yet been published in final form and subjected to peer review. In addition, all the studies reported here were conducted before the widespread use of surfactant therapy. It is unclear whether the benefit of antenatal TRH and steroid therapy on end points such as death or BPD would persist if surfactant was also used. (Surfactant has, however, little impact on the percentage of survivors with BPD, perhaps because sicker infants survive with this treatment and go on to develop BPD.) Studies comparing antenatal TRH plus steroid plus postnatal surfactant to antenatal steroid plus postnatal surfactant are clearly required, and are in progress in a number of centers around the world. Because of these limitations, the routine use of antenatal TRH plus steroid cannot be currently recommended. However, the apparent benefits of this therapy in terms of RDS, death, and CLD that have been reported here do suggest that it might be used in selected situations. An example is threatened delivery of a very premature infant with an immature amniotic fluid pulmonary maturation profile. These infants are at risk for RDS and CLD, even if antenatal steroid and postnatal surfactant therapy is used.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)<doc-sep>A randomized, controlled trial of antepartum thyrotropin-releasing hormone and betamethasone in the prevention of respiratory disease in preterm infants.<doc-sep>The objective was to investigate whether the addition of thyrotropin-releasing hormone to antepartum betamethasone further reduces the incidence of respiratory disease in preterm infants.\n                A randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial of antepartum thyrotropin-releasing hormone (400 micrograms given intravenously four times) and betamethasone (5 mg given intramuscularly four times) was conducted in 378 mothers likely to be delivered between 24 and 32.6 weeks' gestation. Statistical analysis was by relative risk, chi 2, t tests, and multiple logistic regression analysis.\n                Four hundred five live-born infants were delivered. In infants without lethal abnormalities delivered between 24 hours and 10 days from entry (n = 175) the incidence of respiratory distress syndrome was reduced from 52% to 31% (relative risk 0.61, 95% confidence interval 0.41 to 0.89) and that of severe respiratory distress syndrome from 42% to 20% (relative risk 0.48, 95% confidence interval 0.29 to 0.78) in the placebo and thyrotropin-releasing hormone groups, respectively. The number of deaths fell from 14 to one (relative risk 0.08, 95% confidence interval 0.01 to 0.63). The incidence of chronic lung disease was not significantly different, but that of an adverse outcome (chronic lung disease or death by 36 weeks' gestation) fell from 29% in the placebo group to 16% with thyrotropin-releasing hormone (relative risk 0.55, 95% confidence interval 0.31 to 0.99).\n                The addition of thyrotropin-releasing hormone to antepartum glucocorticoid treatment reduces the incidence of respiratory distress syndrome and improves survival in preterm infants.<doc-sep>Collaborative trial of prenatal thyrotropin-releasing hormone and corticosteroids for prevention of respiratory distress syndrome. Collaborative Santiago Surfactant Group.<doc-sep>Our purpose was to determine whether adding antenatal thyrotropin-releasing hormone to prenatal corticosteroids reduces the frequency of respiratory distress syndrome.\n                A randomized, multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was conducted of thyrotropin-releasing hormone (400 micrograms intravenously every 8 hours four times) in women with singleton pregnancies < 33 weeks of gestation who received antenatal betamethasone (12 mg intramuscularly every 24 hours two times). Neonates weighing < 1.0 kg received prophylactic surfactant and those above that weight received rescue therapy.\n                One hundred ninety women received thyrotropin-releasing hormone and 180 were given placebo. There were no differences in the frequency of respiratory distress syndrome (relative risk 1.17 [95% confidence interval 0.93 to 1.48]), use of oxygen at age 28 days (1.14 [0.80 to 1.62]), or neonatal mortality (1.05 [0.79 to 1.38]). Air leaks were more frequent in the thyrotropin-releasing hormone group (1.57 [1.23 to 2.01]).\n                The combination of antenatal thyrotropin-releasing hormone and corticosteroids does not reduce the frequency of respiratory distress syndrome or improve the outcome of preterm neonates compared with the use of corticosteroids alone.<doc-sep>Two trials of antenatal thyrotrophin-releasing hormone for fetal maturation: stopping before the due date. Antenatal TRH Trial and the Thyroneth Trial Groups.<doc-sep>To determine whether the addition of antenatal thyrotrophin-releasing hormone (TRH) to corticosteroids, given to women at risk of preterm delivery, would decrease the risk of death and severe morbidity associated with prematurity.\n                Two concurrent multicentre, double blind, randomised, placebo-controlled trials were designed with a common core dataset to be analysed as a single large pragmatic trial.\n                Hospital maternity units.\n                Pregnant women at risk of preterm delivery who had been prescribed a course of corticosteroids to enhance fetal maturation.\n                Antenatal administration of TRH 400 microg every eight hours for four doses versus matching placebo.\n                Primary: death of the baby or chronic lung disease (defined as oxygen dependency at 28 days after birth). Secondary: other measures of respiratory morbidity, in particular respiratory distress syndrome. Other measures of short term neonatal morbidity including intraventricular haemorrhage and necrotising enterocolitis. Measures of maternal side effects.\n                The antenatal TRH trial was halted early on the basis of external evidence. Overall a total of 225 women were recruited who delivered 275 babies. The primary outcome of death or chronic lung disease occurred in 33 babies in the TRH group and 43 babies in the placebo group (RR 0.8, 95% CI 0.5-1.2). There were no other differences between the two groups. Stratified analysis did not reveal any differences between the two groups depending on how long before the time of delivery the mother had received the TRH or placebo.\n                These trials are too small to provide convincing evidence of the effect of antenatal TRH on neonatal outcome. When added to the existing systematic review and meta-analysis, however, these data should provide evidence on which subsequent practice can be based. The process by which the trials were monitored and stopped is of relevance to future trials.<doc-sep>Respiratory disease in very-low-birthweight infants after prenatal thyrotropin-releasing hormone and glucocorticoid. TRH Study Group.<doc-sep>Although prenatal glucocorticoid treatment reduces neonatal respiratory morbidity, respiratory distress syndrome and chronic lung disease (CLD) develop in many very-low-birthweight infants despite therapy. To investigate the effect of additional prenatal treatment with thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH), we did a multicentre, blinded, randomised trial. 404 women with threatened preterm delivery at less than 32 weeks' gestation received betamethasone plus TRH (4 doses of 400 micrograms 8-hourly) or betamethasone plus placebo. 103 infants who were fully treated and of less than 1500 g birthweight were evaluated during the neonatal period. TRH treatment (55 infants) did not affect the total incidence of respiratory distress syndrome (47% vs 58% in controls) or of severe respiratory distress syndrome (13% vs 25% in controls, p = 0.11). CLD (defined as requirement for supplemental oxygen at 28 days after birth) developed in significantly fewer TRH-treated infants (18% vs 44% of controls, p less than 0.01). The unadjusted relative risk of CLD with TRH therapy was 0.40 (95% CI 0.26-0.80, p less than 0.05), and this was not materially changed after adjustment for potentially modifying variables. There were significantly fewer adverse outcomes, defined as death or continuing oxygen requirement, in the TRH group than in the steroid-alone group both at 28 days and when infants reached 36 weeks' postconceptional age. The incidence of other complications of prematurity was similar in the two groups. Prenatal TRH reduces the incidence of chronic lung disease among betamethasone-treated infants.<doc-sep>Antenatal thyrotropin-releasing hormone to prevent lung disease in preterm infants.

The addition of antenatal thyrotropin-releasing hormone therapy has been reported to decrease pulmonary morbidity in these infants.\n                We enrolled 996 women at 13 North American centers who were in preterm labor at <30 weeks' gestation in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized trial of antenatal thyrotropin-releasing hormone, given intravenously in four doses of 400 microg each at eight-hour intervals. The primary outcome was chronic lung disease or death of the infant on or before the 28th day after delivery, and secondary outcomes were respiratory distress syndrome and chronic lung disease or death at 36 weeks' postmenstrual age. Complete data were available for 981 women and their 1134 live-born infants. The 769 infants born at < or = 32 weeks' gestation were defined as the group at risk.\n                There were no significant differences between the at-risk treatment and placebo groups in mean (+/-SD) birth weight (1109+/-354 vs. 1097+/-355 g), gestational age (27.9+/-2.1 vs. 27.9+/-2.1 weeks), sex, or race. The frequencies of respiratory distress syndrome (66 percent vs. 65 percent), death at 28 days (11 percent vs. 11 percent), chronic lung disease or death at 28 days (45 percent vs. 42 percent) and at 36 weeks (32 percent vs. 34 percent), and other neonatal complications as well as the severity of lung disease were not significantly different in the at-risk treatment and placebo groups. Similarly, there were no differences in outcome between the treatment and placebo groups for the infants born at >32 weeks' gestation.\n                In preterm infants at risk for lung disease, antenatal administration of thyrotropin-releasing hormone and glucocorticoid is no more beneficial than glucocorticoid alone.<doc-sep>",

         "[Ante-partum administration of preventive treatment of Rh-D immunization in rhesus-negative women. Parallel evaluation of transplacental passage of fetal blood cells. Results of a multicenter study carried out in the Paris region].<doc-sep>1,969 non immunized rhesus negative primiparous women were followed up in 23 maternity units in the geographical region of Paris. 1,882 could be retained to study antepartum protection and 1,884 to study transplacental passage of fetal blood cells. Two groups were defined according to whether they were born in even or uneven years, so that: 955 were the \"control\" group who delivered 590 rhesus D positive infants, and 927 were the \"treated\" group who delivered 599 rhesus D positive infants. The \"control\" group were used as controls at the 28th and 34th weeks of pregnancy, while the \"treated\" group received two injections of anti-D immunoglobulin given on the same dates after taking the necessary tests. Immunological testing at the time of the delivery and after the delivery showed that 7 women had become Rh D immunized in the \"control\" group whereas only one in the \"treated\" group. This difference, which is statistically significant, confirms the results of other authors about the efficiency of antepartum rhesus disease prevention. The incidence of immunisation during or immediately after the first pregnancy in women who had no previous story of blood transfusions or of terminations of pregnancy is 1.11%, which is a figure relatively low as compared with studies of series carried out in North America, but close to those carried out in other European centres. When primipara of all categories are lumped together the frequency rises to 1.5%. A study of the passage of fetal red blood cells into the maternal circulation shows that at the 29th week of pregnancy out of 1,884 cases there were 5.5% positive kleihauer tests, without a large volume of blood being detected and at the 34th week of pregnancy when 957 tests were carried out, 7% were positive with one of them being of a massive transfusion of blood from the fetus to the mother, which was life-threatening for the fetus. It may be that the incidence had been under-estimated and that the positive results in the two groups, control and treated, show that there is a statistically significant difference that demonstrates that antepartum treatment in the trial has eliminated a worthwhile percentage of positive kleihauer tests which arose from the transfusion of small quantities of blood.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)<doc-sep>Multicentre trial of antepartum low-dose anti-D immunoglobulin.<doc-sep>Routine antenatal Rh immunoprophylaxis would substantially increase the use of anti-D Ig in the U.K. As availability of anti-D Ig is one factor influencing a decision to introduce routine antenatal prophylaxis, a trial was undertaken to test the efficacy of a lower dose of anti-D Ig than that used in earlier studies. RhD-negative primigravidae were randomized as controls or recipients of two doses of 250iu of anti-D Ig given at 28 and 34 weeks gestation. Blood samples were tested at delivery and at 6 months postpartum for the presence of immune anti-D, and again later if results were equivocal. Nine (1.5%) out of 595 control patients had immune anti-D at follow-up at 6 months and later; 4 (0.78%) of 513 treated women were immunized. It was concluded that, while two doses of 250iu of anti-D Ig may reduce alloimmunization, they are not as effective as two doses of 500iu in a previous trial.<doc-sep>",

Division of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Torreon, Coah, Mexico. The patients were all the women admitted to the labor and delivery ward with diagnosis of severe pre-eclampsia and viable conceptus were assigned at random to receive either Diazepam (Group A, n = 19) or Magnesium sulfate (group B, n = 19). There were no significant differences between both groups. All of the patients remained alert, conscious and well oriented. None of the newborns showed hiporreflexia, flaccidity or neonatal respiratory distress that could be implicated to the anticonvulsivant therapy. It is concluded that Diazepam and Magnesium sulfate are good alternatives as anticonvulsivant therapy in cases of severe pre-eclampsia.<doc-sep>A comparison of magnesium sulfate with phenytoin for the prevention of eclampsia.<doc-sep>Magnesium sulfate is used widely to prevent eclamptic seizures in pregnant women with hypertension, but few studies have compared the efficacy of magnesium sulfate with that of other drugs. Anticonvulsant prophylaxis with phenytoin for eclampsia has been recommended, but there are virtually no data to support its efficacy. Our objective was to compare magnesium sulfate with phenytoin in preventing seizures in hypertensive women during labor.\n                We randomly assigned women with hypertension who were admitted for delivery to receive either magnesium sulfate or phenytoin. The magnesium sulfate regimen consisted of a 10-g intramuscular loading dose followed by a maintenance dose of 5 g given intramuscularly every four hours. For women with severe preeclampsia, an additional 4-g loading dose was given intravenously. The phenytoin regimen included a 1000-mg loading dose infused over a period of 1 hour, followed by a 500-mg oral dose 10 hours later. With either regimen, anticonvulsant therapy was continued for 24 hours post partum.\n                Ten of 1089 women randomly assigned to the phenytoin regimen had eclamptic convulsions, as compared with none of 1049 women randomly assigned to magnesium sulfate (P = 0.004). There were no significant differences in any risk factors for eclampsia between the two study groups. Maternal and infant outcomes were also similar in the two study groups.\n                Magnesium sulfate is superior to phenytoin for the prevention of eclampsia in hypertensive pregnant women. These results validate the long-practiced use of magnesium sulfate in the prevention of eclampsia.<doc-sep>Comparison of magnesium and methyldopa for the control of blood pressure in pregnancies complicated with hypertension.<doc-sep>Although magnesium is now the drug of choice for the prevention of eclamptic seizures only few studies have evaluated whether magnesium may reduce blood pressure in pregnancies complicated with hypertension.\n                A total of 33 patients with pregnancy-induced hypertension were randomized to either magnesium or methyldopa treatment. Of these 16 received magnesium and 17 methyldopa. The treatment comprised a 48-hour magnesium infusion followed by oral magnesium tablets until 3 days after delivery or 250 mg methyldopa 4 times a day in a similar period.\n                Patients treated with magnesium had 1 day after inclusion a statistically significantly lower systolic blood pressure compared to the level in the methyldopa group (138.1 +/- 11 vs. 147.6 +/- 11 mm Hg; p < 0.05), but no difference was observed in diastolic blood pressure (92.0 +/- 6.6 vs. 96.0 +/- 10.1 mm Hg; NS). From the 5th day of inclusion and until delivery both systolic and diastolic blood pressure were significantly lower in the magnesium group (p < 0.05). Including all blood pressure measurements in a single analysis showed that both systolic (138 +/- 13 vs. 148 +/- 15 mm Hg; p < 0.0001) and diastolic (92 +/- 10 vs. 94 +/- 10 mm Hg; p < 0.05) blood pressure were lower in the magnesium group compared to the methyldopa group. There was no difference between the two groups regarding gestational age at delivery, birth weight, Apgar scores and pH in umbilical cord blood.\n                This preliminary study demonstrates that magnesium treatment lowers blood pressure in pregnancies complicated with hypertension.

Secondary outcomes were to assess the side effects associated with magnesium sulfate therapy: hours and maximum dose of oxytocin, incidence of progression to severe preeclampsia, incidence of cesarean delivery, change in maternal hematocrit, incidence of postpartum hemorrhage, incidence of maternal infection, and Apgar scores.\n                Women with a diagnosis of mild preeclampsia at term were randomized to receive standard therapy during labor and for 12 hours post partum with either magnesium sulfate (n = 67) or a matching placebo solution (n = 68).\n                There was no difference between magnesium sulfate and placebo with respect to the primary outcome variables: total length of labor (median 17.8 hours vs 16.5 hours, p = 0.7) and length of the active phase of labor (median 5.4 hours vs 6.0 hours, p = 0.5). In addition, no difference was observed in the secondary outcome variables: hours of oxytocin use, change in hematocrit, frequency of maternal infection, progression to severe preeclampsia, incidence of cesarean delivery, and Apgar scores. Although not statistically significant, the incidence of postpartum hemorrhage was approximately fourfold greater in the magnesium sulfate group (relative risk 4.1, 95% confidence interval 0.5 to 35.4). There was a significant difference in the maximum dose of oxytocin used (13.9 +/- 8.6 mU/min with magnesium sulfate vs 11.0 +/- 7.6 mU/min with placebo, p = 0.036).\n                The use of magnesium sulfate during labor in women with mild preeclampsia at term does not affect any component of labor but did necessitate a higher dose of oxytocin.<doc-sep>Do women with pre-eclampsia, and their babies, benefit from magnesium sulphate? The Magpie Trial: a randomised placebo-controlled trial.<doc-sep>Anticonvulsants are used for pre-eclampsia in the belief they prevent eclamptic convulsions, and so improve outcome. Evidence supported magnesium sulphate as the drug to evaluate.\n                Eligible women (n=10141) had not given birth or were 24 h or less postpartum; blood pressure of 140/90 mm Hg or more, and proteinuria of 1+ (30 mg/dL) or more; and there was clinical uncertainty about magnesium sulphate. Women were randomised in 33 countries to either magnesium sulphate (n=5071) or placebo (n=5070). Primary outcomes were eclampsia and, for women randomised before delivery, death of the baby. Follow up was until discharge from hospital after delivery. Analyses were by intention to treat.\n                Follow-up data were available for 10,110 (99.7%) women, 9992 (99%) of whom received the allocated treatment. 1201 of 4999 (24%) women given magnesium sulphate reported side-effects versus 228 of 4993 (5%) given placebo. Women allocated magnesium sulphate had a 58% lower risk of eclampsia (95% CI 40-71) than those allocated placebo (40, 0.8%, vs 96, 1.9%; 11 fewer women with eclampsia per 1000 women). Maternal mortality was also lower among women allocated magnesium sulphate (relative risk 0.55, 0.26-1.14). For women randomised before delivery, there was no clear difference in the risk of the baby dying (576, 12.7%, vs 558, 12.4%; relative risk 1.02, 99% CI 0.92-1.14). The only notable difference in maternal or neonatal morbidity was for placental abruption (relative risk 0.67, 99% CI 0.45-0.89).\n                Magnesium sulphate halves the risk of eclampsia, and probably reduces the risk of maternal death.

Women with rupture of the membranes, spontaneous contractions resulting in cervical change, or an initial cervical examination showing > 2 cm dilatation and 50% effacement were excluded.\n                Fifty-four women were randomized to receive either magnesium sulfate (n = 28) or phenytoin (n = 26). The two groups were similar for selected maternal antepartum, intrapartum, and postpartum characteristics that have been associated with a prolongation or failure of labor induction. The two groups were also similar for the interval from the start of induction to (1) the first examination > or = 5 cm cervical dilatation and (2) delivery and in the frequency of women requiring cesarean delivery.\n                Compared with phenytoin, magnesium sulfate seizure prophylaxis in women with pregnancy-associated hypertension does not prolong the induction of labor nor does it result in an increase in cesarean deliveries.<doc-sep>Magnesium sulfate in women with mild preeclampsia: a randomized controlled trial.<doc-sep>To determine whether magnesium sulfate prevents disease progression in women with mild preeclampsia.\n                A total of 222 women with mild preeclampsia were randomized to receive intravenous magnesium sulfate (n = 109) or matched placebo (n = 113). Mild preeclampsia was defined as blood pressure of at least 140/90 mm Hg taken on two occasions in the presence of new-onset proteinuria. Patients with chronic hypertension or severe preeclampsia were excluded. Patients were considered to have disease progression if they developed signs or symptoms of severe preeclampsia, eclampsia, or laboratory abnormalities of full or partial HELLP (hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, low platelets) syndrome.\n                The groups were similar with respect to maternal age, ethnicity, gestational age, parity, and maternal weight at enrollment. Fourteen women (12.8%) in the magnesium group and 19 (16.8%) in the placebo group developed severe preeclampsia after randomization (relative risk = 0.8, 95% confidence interval 0.4, 1.5, P =.41). None in either group developed eclampsia or thrombocytopenia. Women assigned magnesium had similar rates of cesarean delivery (30% versus 25%), chorioamnionitis (3% versus 2.7%), endometritis (5.3% versus 4.3%), and postpartum hemorrhage (1% versus 0.9%), compared to those assigned placebo. Neonates born to women assigned magnesium had similar mean Apgar scores at 1 and 5 minutes as those born to women assigned placebo (7.7 +/- 1.5 versus 7.8 +/- 1.6 and 8.7 +/- 0.7 versus 8.8 +/- 0.6, respectively).\n                Magnesium sulfate does not have a major impact on disease progression in women with mild preeclampsia.

Observed were the rate of cervical dilation during active labor and change in hematocrit between predelivery and 24-hour postdelivery values and the incidence of side effects ascertained by interview. Compared with those receiving magnesium sulfate, patients receiving phenytoin had more rapid cervical dilation (3.3 cm/hr versus 1.5 cm/hr, p = 0.016) and a smaller fall in hematocrit after delivery (-4.7% versus -7.6%, p = 0.034). A significantly lower incidence of hot flushes (15% versus 46%, p < 0.005) and a trend toward less dyspnea and weakness were reported by phenytoin-treated patients. Our phenytoin regimen produced acceptable serum phenytoin levels (10 to 25 micrograms/ml) in 96% of patients.<doc-sep>Expectant management in severe preeclampsia: does magnesium sulfate prevent the development of eclampsia?<doc-sep>Although magnesium sulfate has been traditional or standard treatment for severe preeclampsia and eclampsia to prevent convulsions, its efficiency has always been in doubt and its induced side-effects also make it controversial for use. In this study, 64 patients, diagnosed with severe preeclampsia, were randomized into group I (34 patients) managed with MgSO4, and group II (30 patients) managed without MgSO4. There were no occurrences of eclampsia in either group. Although there was no statistical significance in the final delivery method, group I had a higher rate in cesarean section, in which most were significantly due to fetal distress (p < 0.05). Furthermore, group I had significantly more babies with poor apgar score than group II (p = 0.019). During the treatment period for those with a gestational age of less than 34 weeks, there were two patients with abruptio placentae in group I and the treatment periods were noted to be longer in group II than in group I. From the results of monitoring serum magnesium level in group I, when therapeutic level was achieved, magnesium sulfate induced great discomfort which might have led to the deterioration of the patients' condition. According to this study, magnesium sulfate's minimal efficiency, and its adverse side-effects, also make magnesium sulfate a poor choice in the management of preeclampsia. Therefore, because of our poor understanding of the etiology of preeclampsia, suitable management should be undertaken without magnesium sulfate. Improvement of the patient's pathophysiological condition or termination of pregnancy as early as possible, is recommended.<doc-sep>A comparison of magnesium sulfate and nimodipine for the prevention of eclampsia.<doc-sep>Magnesium sulfate may prevent eclampsia by reducing cerebral vasoconstriction and ischemia. Nimodipine is a calcium-channel blocker with specific cerebral vasodilator activity. Our objective was to determine whether nimodipine is more effective than magnesium sulfate for seizure prophylaxis in women with severe preeclampsia.\n                We conducted an unblinded, multicenter trial in which 1650 women with severe preeclampsia were randomly assigned to receive either nimodipine (60 mg orally every 4 hours) or intravenous magnesium sulfate (given according to the institutional protocol) from enrollment until 24 hours post partum. High blood pressure was controlled with intravenous hydralazine as needed. The primary outcome measure was the development of eclampsia, as defined by a witnessed tonic-clonic seizure.\n                Demographic and clinical characteristics were similar in the two groups. The women who received nimodipine were more likely to have a seizure than those who received magnesium sulfate (21 of 819 [2.6 percent] vs. 7 of 831 [0.8 percent], P=0.01). The adjusted risk ratio for eclampsia associated with nimodipine, as compared with magnesium sulfate, was 3.2 (95 percent confidence interval, 1.1 to 9.1). The antepartum seizure rates did not differ significantly between groups, but the nimodipine group had a higher rate of postpartum seizures (9 of 819 [1.1 percent] vs. 0 of 831, P=0.01). There were no significant differences in neonatal outcome between the two groups. More women in the magnesium sulfate group than in the nimodipine group needed hydralazine to control blood pressure (54.3 percent vs. 45.7 percent, P<0.001).\n                Magnesium sulfate is more effective than nimodipine for prophylaxis against seizures in women with severe preeclampsia.\n                Copyright 2003 Massachusetts Medical Society<doc-sep>",

While bronchodilator administration with the metered dose inhaler (MDI) and reservoir or spacer attachment is as effective as administration with the nebulizer in most settings, the former has not been widely accepted for treatment of acute airway obstruction in the emergency room. We compared the efficacy of the continuous flow nebulizer to that of the MDI with InspirEase (reservoir spacer) in 75 patients (45 men and 30 women), ages 18-73 (chi 44 years) who presented to the emergency room with acute asthma and COPD. Subjects in each group (22 COPD and 53 asthma) were randomly assigned to treatment with three puffs of metaproterenol (0.65 mg/puff) via the MDI with InspirEase plus nebulizer with placebo, or placebo MDI with InspirEase plus nebulizer with 15 mg metaproterenol in double blind fashion. Either treatment was given three times at 30 min intervals. The FEV1 and dyspnea scores according to the Borg scale were measured at baseline, 30 min after the first treatment, and 30 min after the third. There was no significant outcome difference between the two treatments in either diagnostic group. There also was no significant outcome difference for patients with baseline FEV1 less than 0.9L. Serum theophylline levels, the need for concomitant therapy with corticosteroids, or additional emergency room therapy after the study, hospitalizations and treatment side effects did not differ between treatment groups. We conclude that there is no demonstrable advantage of a continuous flow nebulizer over an MDI with InspirEase for the treatment of acute airflow obstruction.<doc-sep>Comparative efficacy of terbutaline administered by Nebuhaler and by nebulizer in young children with acute asthma.<doc-sep>We compared the use of terbutaline sulphate that was delivered by a nebulizer with its delivery by a Nebuhaler at two dose levels in 27 children (nine children per group) of between three and six years of age with acute asthma. No significant difference was found in the mean baseline clinical score among the three groups, and a significant decline occurred in the mean clinical scores in all groups by 15 minutes which was maintained to 60 minutes after the dose was administered. The decline that was achieved with delivery of the drug by way of a Nebuhaler (at either dose level) was not significantly different from that with a nebulizer, although cooperation with Nebuhaler usage was not universal in the age-group.<doc-sep>Nebuhaler versus nebuliser in children with acute asthma.<doc-sep><doc-sep>A comparison of albuterol administered by metered dose inhaler (and holding chamber) or wet nebulizer in acute asthma.<doc-sep>Comparative studies of albuterol by wet nebulizer or metered dose inhaler have tested fixed doses of medications. We compared the dose-response relationship to albuterol by wet nebulization or metered dose inhaler in acute asthma.\n                Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. Patients with acute asthma received either albuterol, 0.4 mg, by metered dose inhaler (and holding chamber) or albuterol, 2.5 mg, by wet nebulizer every 30 min until maximal bronchodilation. Forty patients (forced expiratory volume in 1 s [FEV1]: 1.15 +/- 0.43 L; 36 +/- 12 percent predicted) received metered dose inhaler and 40 others (FEV1: 1.08 +/- 0.52 L; 35 +/- 16 percent predicted) received wet nebulization.\n                Twenty-six patients (65 percent) receiving metered dose inhaler and 30 (75 percent) receiving wet nebulization achieved maximal bronchodilation after two doses. Almost all reached maximal bronchodilation by four doses. The FEV1 improved by 0.72 +/- 0.49 L for metered dose inhaler and 0.68 +/- 0.61 L for wet nebulizer (p = 0.71). A significant linear relationship was seen in both groups (metered dose inhaler r = 0.94; wet nebulizer r = 0.98) between the log dose of albuterol and change in FEV1. About 1/6 the wet nebulizer dose of albuterol was needed to achieve similar response to the metered dose inhaler.\n                Albuterol by metered dose inhaler provided similar bronchodilation to that achieved by wet nebulization in patients with acute asthma. The cumulative dose-response technique is applicable in the emergency department setting and is helpful in comparing the relative utility of various bronchodilator regimens.<doc-sep>Efficacy and safety of a home-made non-valved spacer for bronchodilator therapy in acute asthma.<doc-sep>The aim of this study was to assess the efficacy and safety of an alternative spacer to deliver salbutamol in acute asthma. A prospective randomized study was performed with 196 patients with acute asthma, aged 4-15 y. The clinical features, oxygen saturation (SaO2) and the best of three peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR) measurements were recorded in a standardized questionnaire. Each patient received up to three conventional doses of salbutamol through an alternative home-made non-valved spacer (NVS) (500 ml mineral water plastic bottle) or an oxygen-driven nebulizer (ODN). The clinical and functional respiratory parameters (PEFR and SaO2) were assessed 15 min after each administration of the bronchodilator. In the ODN (n = 99) and NVS (n = 97) groups, PEFR (p > 0.05) and SaO2 (p > 0.05) measurements improved in all stages of the treatment. During the asthma attacks, the ODN group needed a prolonged observation in the emergency room (p = 0.000000). Side effects of salbutamol, e.g. increased heart rate, were observed in 17.2% of the patients in the ODN group and 4.1% in the NVS group (p = 0.003).\n                Both devices showed comparable efficacy in mild and moderate acute attacks, but the use of the alternative NVS resulted in a shorter observation period in the emergency room. The frequency of side effects was significantly higher in the ODN group than in the NVS group.<doc-sep>High-dose albuterol by metered-dose inhaler plus a spacer device versus nebulization in preschool children with recurrent wheezing: A double-blind, randomized equivalence trial.<doc-sep>Inhaled albuterol is the most frequently used bronchodilator for acute wheezing, and nebulization is the standard mode of delivery in hospital setting. However, recent guidelines consider spacer devices as an easier to use, and cost-saving alternative and recommend the high-dose metered-dose inhaler bronchodilator.\n                To demonstrate clinical equivalence between a spacer device and a nebulizer for albuterol administration.\n                Randomized, double-blind, parallel group equivalence trial.\n                Pediatric emergency wards at 2 tertiary teaching hospitals.\n                Sixty-four 12- to 60-month-old children with acute recurrent wheezing (32 per group).\n                Albuterol was administered through the spacer device (50 microg/kg) or through the nebulizer (150 microg/kg) and repeated 3 times at 20-minute intervals. Parents completed a questionnaire.\n                Pulmonary index, hospitalization, ease of use, acceptability, and pulse oximetry saturation.\n                The 90% confidence interval of the difference between treatment groups for the median absolute changes in pulmonary index values between T0 and T60 was [-1; +1] and was included in the equivalence interval [-1.5; +1.5]. Clinical improvement increased with time. Less than 10% of the children (3 in each group) required hospitalization (2 in each group attributable to treatment failure). Parents considered administration of albuterol using the spacer device easier (94%) and better accepted by their children (62%).\n                The efficacy of albuterol administered using the spacer device was equivalent to that of the nebulizer. Given its high tolerance, repeated 50-microg/kg doses of albuterol administered through the spacer device should be considered in hospital emergency departments as first-line therapy for wheezing.<doc-sep>Wet nebulizer versus spacer and metered dose inhaler via tidal breathing.<doc-sep><doc-sep>[Bronchodilation induced by fenoterol in asthmatic patients: comparison of jet nebulization and spacer device].<doc-sep>To compare bronchodilation attained by fenoterol administered through a jet nebulizer and through a spacer device.\n                Open, randomized.\n                44 adults with asthma, peak-flow rate varying between 120 and 200 l/min.

Consecutive doses at twenty minute intervals were administered until either no significant improvement in pulmonary function was observed or until a cumulative dose of 0.15 mg/Kg (maximum of 5 mgs) had been given. All subjects finally received a dose of 0.15 mg/Kg (maximum of 5 mgs) of nebulized Salbutamol at the end of the study. No difference in bronchodilation was obvious between the methods of treatment. No significant side-effect was observed in any patient. Treatment of acute asthma in children with Salbutamol via a pressurized inhaler, spacer and tidal breathing mechanism may be an efficacious, safe and readily available method, but further work is needed before it can be recommended for routine home management of asthma attacks.<doc-sep>Treatment of acute severe asthma with inhaled albuterol delivered via jet nebulizer, metered dose inhaler with spacer, or dry powder.<doc-sep>Despite the increasing use of dry powder formulations in the ambulatory setting, there is a paucity of information on the efficacy of this therapeutic modality to treat acute severe asthma. In addition, studies that compared wet nebulization vs metered dose inhalers formulated with chlorofluorocarbon (CFCMDI) attached to holding chambers have yielded discrepant results. Thus, it is unclear which of the three delivery systems would elicit a superior bronchodilator response, particularly in patients with life-threatening asthma. In a prospective, randomized open design, we studied the response to inhaled albuterol (salbutamol) in 27 adult asthmatics presenting to the emergency department (ED) with an FEV1 <30% predicted. Subjects were treated with one of the following regimens (nine subjects in each group): group A, mean (SD) baseline FEV1 of 0.7 (0.2) L, received albuterol solution, 5 mg, via a nebulizer (Puritan-Bennett Raindrop; Lawrenceville, Ga) impelled with oxygen (O2) at 8 L/min; group B, baseline FEV1 of 0.6 (0.15) L, received albuterol, 400 microg, via a CFCMDI attached to a 145-mL valved aerosol holding chamber (Aerochamber; Trudell Medical; London, ON); and group C, baseline FEV1 of 0.6 (0.17) L, received albuterol powder, 400 microg, by another means (Rotahaler; Glaxo; Research Triangle Park, NC). All groups received the respective treatments on arrival in the ED, every 30 min during the first 2 h, and then hourly until the sixth hour. Clinical parameters and FEV1 were recorded on ED admission and 15 min after each dose of albuterol. At the time of ED admission, all patients also received continuous O2 and one dose of I.V. steroids (dexamethasone, 8 mg). The total dose of inhaled albuterol administered during the 6-h treatment was 45 mg of nebulized solution in group A and 3,600 microg of albuterol aerosol and dry powder in groups B and C, respectively. No significant differences were found in the population demographics, baseline FEV1, and arterial blood gas values on air. FEV1 improved significantly in all patients after the 6 h of treatment. The 6-h area under the curve FEV1 improved similarly with the three delivery methods despite differences in the total dose administered. No patient was discontinued during the trial or admitted to hospital and no evidence of cardiovascular adverse events was apparent in any of the study groups. These data support the view that the three delivery methods appear adequate to treat subjects with acute severe asthma.<doc-sep>Efficacy of albuterol administered by nebulizer versus spacer device in children with acute asthma.<doc-sep>The aim of this study was to compare the response to inhaled albuterol after administration by nebulizer with the response after administration by a metered-dose inhaler and spacer device (MDI-spacer) to children with acute asthma. In a double-blind fashion, 33 children (6 to 14 years of age) with forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) between 20% and 70% of predicted values, and who were seen in the emergency department with acute asthma, were studied. They were treated with aerosolized albuterol or placebo by MDI-spacer, followed immediately by albuterol or placebo administered by nebulizer with oxygen. The dose ratio for albuterol by MDI-spacer versus nebulizer was 1:5. Outcome measures included a clinical score, respiratory rate, arterial oxygen saturation, and FEV1, measured before and 10, 20, and 40 minutes after treatment. With the exception of heart rate (which increased in the nebulizer group and decreased in the MDI-spacer group (p < 0.05), no difference in the rate of improvement of clinical score, respiratory rate, arterial oxygen saturation, or FEV1 was noted during the 40-minute study period between children who received albuterol by nebulizer and those who received it by MDI-spacer. We conclude that spacers and nebulizers are equally effective means of delivering beta 2-agonists to children with acute asthma.<doc-sep>Management of acute asthma in children using metered dose inhaler and small volume nebulizer.<doc-sep>To determine whether the administration of beta2-agonist by Metered Dose inhaler (MDI) with accessory device (AD) is a as effective as the administration of beta2-agonist by small volume nebulizers (SVN) for the treatment of acute asthma.\n                A cross sectional study was conducted at Emergency Room (ER) of National Institute of Child Health (NICH), Karachi, between October 2000 to March 2001. This study included 150 children, 6 months and older with a history of wheeze and presenting with an acute asthma exacerbation. Children were categorized into mild, moderate and severe asthma according to medical scoring system. Children were assigned randomly into group A and B to receive standard dose of beta2-agonist (salbutamol) by MDI/AD (group A) or SVN (group B). Baseline characteristics and asthma severity were recorded. All variables (dyspnoea, use of accessory muscles, cyanosis, respiratory rate, heart rate, blood pressure, oxygen saturation, pulsus paradoxus, and wheeze) and Peak Expiratory Flow Rate (PEFR) in children 5 years and older, were determined at pre and post inhalation therapy.\n                Both groups did not differ in demographic characteristics. There were no significant differences in outcome measures. In children treated with MDI/ADs and SVNs. PEFR increased significantly in both the groups after completion of treatment, but PEFR was not statistically significant when compared in between groups.\n                The data suggested that MDI/AD is an effective alternative to nebulizer for the treatment of children with acute asthma exacerbation in the ER.<doc-sep>Randomised trial spacer v nebuliser for acute asthma.<doc-sep>Sixty hospitalised children with asthma aged 1-5 years were randomised to spacer or nebuliser.

The subjects were randomized into two equal groups to receive aerosolized salbutamol either via nebulizer (Group I) or MDI-spacer (Group II) as per the Consensus Guidelines. The response to therapy was sequentially assessed after 20, 40 and 60 minutes of institution of therapy.\n                A significantly (p < 0.02) greater number of subjects in Group II presented with severe dyspnea and intercostal muscle retraction (subjective assessment). However, the objectively evaluable outcome parameters were comparable (p > 0.05) in both groups at presentation. All the outcome measures showed a significant (p < 0.05) improvement with time in both the groups. The recovery parameters were comparable (p > 0.05) at different time periods in the two groups.\n                MDI-spacer is as effective as a nebulizer for the aerosolized administration of salbutamol in an acute exacerbation of asthma in children. However, for developing countries, distinct advantages (economic and power requirement) argue strongly for utilization of MDI-spacer in preference to nebulizer.<doc-sep>[Different inhaler devices in acute asthma attacks: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study].<doc-sep>To verify the efficacy, side effects, and cost of treatment of acute asthma attacks, using different inhaler devices.\n                This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. Salbutamol was administered via a nebulizer, a metered-dose inhaler (attached to a commercially available spacer device), a homemade non-valved spacer device, or a dry powder inhaler. Assessments were made at zero, 20, 40 and 60 minutes, followed by the application of salbutamol and placebo with another device. Forty children (mean age of 11+/-3.5 years) with acute asthma attacks, were evaluated. Clinical score, forced expiratory volume in one second and side effects were analyzed. The costs for medication and spacer devices were calculated.\n                There is no difference between groups regarding clinical score and variation of forced expiratory volume in one second. There was a major variation in the heart rate response to the nebulizer (35%) compared to the commercially available spacer and dry powder inhaler (15 and 17%) and between the homemade spacer and the commercially available spacer (28 and 15%) (p = 0.004). The nebulizer and homemade spacer caused more tremor (p = 0.02). The cost of treatment was higher for the nebulizer and commercially available spacer (p = 0.0001).\n                The nebulizer was more expensive and used more medicine, showing the same efficiency. The homemade spacer was cheaper, but presented more side effects. The commercially available spacer was as expensive as the nebulizer, although safer. The dry powder inhaler was cheaper, but, just as the homemade spacer, it also caused tachycardia.<doc-sep>Salbutamol treatment of acute severe asthma in the ED: MDI versus hand-held nebulizer.<doc-sep>The objectives of this study were to compare the efficacy of salbutamol delivered by either metered-dose inhaler plus spacer (MDI-spacer) or by wet nebulization (NEB), and to determine the relationships between physiologic responses and plasma salbutamol concentrations. Asthmatic patients presenting to the emergency department (ED) with acute severe asthma (forced expiratory volume in the first second [FEV1] less than 50% of predicted) were enrolled in a randomized, double-blind, parallel-group study. The MDI-spacer group received salbutamol, delivered via MDI into a spacer device, in four puffs actuated in rapid succession at 10-minute intervals (2.4 mg/h). The NEB group was treated with nebulized salbutamol, 1.5 mg, via nebulizer at 15-minute intervals (6 mg/h). Doses were calculated on the basis of the percentage of total dose that reaches the lower airway with both methods. The protocol involved 3 hours of this treatment. Mean peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR) and FEV1 improved significantly over baseline values for both groups (P=.01). However, there were no significant differences between both groups for PEFR and FEV1 at any point studied. The examination of the relationships between cumulative dose of salbutamol and change in FEV1 showed a significant linear relationship (P=.01) for both methods (MDI r=.97; NEB r=.97). The regression equations showed that for every 1 mg of salbutamol by MDI-spacer, 2.5 mg are needed from nebulization to have equal therapeutic response. At the end of treatment, the salbutamol plasma levels were 10.1+/-1.6 ng/ml for the MDI-spacer group and 14.4+/-2.3 ng/ml for the NEB group (P=.0003). Both groups showed a nonsignificant heart rate decrease. A significant group-by-time interaction means that differences between groups increased with time (P=.04). Additionally, the NEB group presented a higher incidence of tremor (P=.03) and anxiety (P=.04), reflecting larger systemic absorption of salbutamol. These data indicate that when doses used are calculated on the basis of the percentage of total drug that reaches the lower airway, there was equivalent bronchodilatation after salbutamol administered by either MDI-spacer or nebulization in patients with acute severe asthma. However, nebulizer therapy produced greater side effects related to the increase in salbutamol absorption and higher plasma level.<doc-sep>Comparison of beta-adrenergic agents delivered by nebulizer vs metered dose inhaler with InspirEase in hospitalized asthmatic patients.<doc-sep>The present study was undertaken to determine if beta-agonists delivered by nebulizer provide better clinical responses than MDI therapy in status asthmaticus. We divided 28 hospitalized asthmatic patients into three groups. Group 1 received albuterol by MDI with InspirEase. Group 2 received nebulized albuterol. Group 3 received nebulized metaproterenol. Both nebulizer regimens resulted in significant improvements in both FVC and FEV1 by 30 min after initial hospital beta-agonist treatment. No significant improvement was noted in initial spirometry in the MDI with InspirEase group. In spite of the superiority of nebulizer therapy in the initial phase of hospitalization, the daily rates of spirometric improvement and duration of hospitalization were not significantly different among the three groups. Our results indicate that nebulizer therapy provides superior spirometric improvement in the initial phase of status asthmaticus. However, both MDI and nebulizer regimens provided similar rates of spirometric improvement and duration of hospitalization.<doc-sep>Delivery of albuterol in a pediatric emergency department.<doc-sep>To determine if albuterol delivery by the combination of a metered-dose inhaler (MDI) with a spacer is equal in effectiveness to nebulization in a pediatric emergency department setting.\n                Prospective series.\n                Urban children's hospital emergency department.\n                Patients > or = six years of age with the diagnosis of acute asthma exacerbation.

Each patient received three albuterol treatments administered evenly over one hour. The dose ratio for albuterol by nebulizer versus MDI-spacer was 6.9:1. Outcome was assessed by comparing the pre- and posttreatment percent predicted respiratory rate and percent predicted peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR) for each patient.\n                Sixty patients were enrolled in the study. All three treatment groups showed significant improvement following albuterol therapy in both percent predicted respiratory rate and percent predicted PEFR. When comparing the three groups against each other in regard to outcome, no significant differences were found in improvement of percent predicted respiratory rate (P = 0.3258) or percent predicted PEFR (P = 0.9362).\n                In a pediatric emergency department setting, aerosolized albuterol delivered by MDI-spacer was equal in effectiveness to nebulization in the acute asthma management of children > or = six years of age.<doc-sep>Emergency department treatment of severe asthma.

No significant (p > 0.58) differences occurred in baseline mean FEV1, FVC, or PEFR for the two groups. For both groups, significant improvement occurred in mean FEV1 at 30 min (p < 0.02) and at 60 min (p < 0.02), and in maximum mean FEV1 (p < 0.001). However, no significant (p > 0.6) differences occurred between groups in mean FEV1, FVC, or PEFR at 30 and 60 min, or in maximum improvement attained. The sample size was sufficiently large to detect a 12 percent difference in improvement with a power of 90 percent. Thirty-three of 35 patients were treated successfully with the study protocol, became asymptomatic, and were discharged home. One patient from each group required further treatment.\n                There was no detectable difference in effectiveness of albuterol administered by nebulizer or the inhaler system for treatment of acute asthma. There was no detectable difference in effectiveness of albuterol administered by nebulizer or the inhaler system for the treatment of acute asthma when the dose was titrated to clinical response.

The participants were children 1 to 4 years of age with moderate to severe acute asthma. Patients assigned to the spacer group received albuterol (600 microg) by MDI by spacer (AeroChamber) followed by placebo by nebulizer (n = 30). The nebulizer group received placebo MDI by spacer followed by 2.5 mg albuterol by nebulizer (n = 30). Treatments were repeated at 20-minute intervals until the patient was judged to need no further doses of bronchodilator, or a total of 6 treatments.\n                Clinical score, heart rate, respiratory rate, auscultatory findings, and oxygen saturation were recorded at baseline, after each treatment, and 60 minutes after the last treatment. Baseline characteristics and asthma severity were similar for the treatment groups. The spacer was as effective as the nebulizer for clinical score, respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation but produced a greater reduction in wheezing (P =.03). Heart rate increased to a greater degree in the nebulizer group (11.0/min vs 0.17/min for spacer, P <.01). Fewer children in the spacer group required admission (33% vs 60% in the nebulizer group, P =.04, adjusted for sex). No differences were seen in rates of tremor or hyperactivity. The mean cost of each emergency department presentation was NZ$825 for the spacer group and NZ$1282 for the nebulizer group (P =.03); 86% of children and 85% of parents preferred the spacer.\n                The MDI and spacer combination was a cost-effective alternative to a nebulizer in the delivery of albuterol to young children with moderate and severe acute asthma.<doc-sep>Metered dose inhaler and nebuliser in acute asthma.<doc-sep>One hundred and eleven children with acute asthma were studied to compare delivery of terbutaline by either a metered dose inhaler (MDI) with a valved holding chamber or a nebuliser driven by air. Eligible patients were randomised; the MDI group received three puffs (0.75 mg) of terbutaline and the nebuliser group received 2 ml (5.0 mg) terbutaline solution diluted with 2 ml 0.9% saline for inhalation over 10 minutes. Patients were evaluated by spirometry, pulse oximetry, and clinical severity scoring system at baseline and again 15 minutes after the beginning of treatment. The baseline data of the two groups were not significantly different. All parameters of spirometry, except the peak expiratory flow (PEF) for the nebuliser group, and clinical severity score for both groups significantly improved after terbutaline treatment. Compared with the nebuliser group, the MDI group after treatment had better mean (SD) oxygen saturation (SaO2; 96.82 (1.63)% v 95.44 (1.88)%), frequency of oxygen desaturation (23.2% v 47.3%), absolute increase of PEF (32.6 (37.7) l/min v 10.2 (34.7) l/min), and SaO2 (0.54 (1.64)% v -0.47 (1.84)%). There was also a mean (SD) per cent increase of forced expiratory volume in one second (22.9 (21.0)% v 15.4 (16.1)%), PEF (27.7 (38.4)%) v 7.7 (25.1)%), and SaO2 (0.58 (1.72)% v -0.47 (1.93)%). In conclusion, aerosol treatment by MDI (with a valved holding chamber) in this study proved to be superior to nebuliser treatment in terms of SaO2 and some measurements of spirometry. Respiratory therapists working with children with severe asthma should be aware of the possibility of oxygen desaturation, especially when using room air as the driving gas for nebulisation.<doc-sep>Metered-dose inhalers with spacers vs nebulizers for pediatric asthma.<doc-sep>To determine whether the administration of beta-agonists by metered-dose inhaler (MDI) with a spacer device is as effective as the administration of beta-agonists by nebulizer for the treatment of acute asthma exacerbations in children.\n                Randomized trial with two arms.\n                Urban pediatric emergency department (ED) in Bronx, NY.\n                Convenience sample of 152 children 2 years and older with a history of at least two episodes of wheezing presenting to the ED with an acute asthma exacerbation.\n                Patients were randomly assigned to receive standard doses of a beta-agonist (albuterol) by an MDI with spacer or by a nebulizer. Dosing intervals and the use of other medications were determined by the treating physician.\n                Baseline characteristics and asthma history were recorded. Asthma severity score, peak expiratory flow rate in children 5 years or older, and oxygen saturation were determined at presentation and before admission or discharge. The groups did not differ in age, sex, ethnicity, age of onset of asthma, or asthma severity score at presentation. There were no significant differences between the groups in outcomes, including mean changes in respiratory rate, asthma severity score, and peak expiratory flow rate, oxygen saturation, number of treatments given, administration of steroids in the ED, and admission rate. Patients given MDIs with spacers required shorter treatment times in the ED (66 minutes vs 103 minutes, P < .001). Fewer patients in the spacer group had episodes of vomiting in the ED (9% vs 20%, P < .04), and patients in the nebulizer group had a significantly greater mean percent increase in heart rate from baseline to final disposition (15% vs 5%, P < .001).\n                These data suggest that MDIs with spacers may be an effective alternative to nebulizers for the treatment of children with acute asthma exacerbations in the ED.<doc-sep>A randomised controlled trial to assess the relative benefits of large volume spacers and nebulisers to treat acute asthma in hospital.<doc-sep>To compare the clinical effectiveness, acceptability, and cost benefit of administering beta2 agonists by means of a metered dose inhaler and large volume spacer with conventional nebulisers to children admitted to hospital with acute asthma.\n                A randomised controlled trial was conducted over five months. Sixty one children older than 3 years admitted to a large teaching hospital and a district general hospital with acute asthma completed the study. Children received either 5 mg of salbutamol up to one hourly by jet nebuliser, or up to 10 puffs of salbutamol 100 microg by means of a metered dose inhaler and spacer up to one hourly.\n                Median hospital stay was 40 hours in the nebuliser group and 36.5 hours in the spacer group. Asthma disability scores at two weeks after discharge were significantly improved in the spacer group. Drug costs were pound 14.62 less for each patient in the spacer group.\n                Large volume spacers are an acceptable, cost effective alternative to nebulisers in treating children admitted with acute asthma, provided that the children can use the mouthpiece, and symptoms are not severe. Their use facilitates effective home treatment by parents, with subsequent reduction in morbidity and re-admission rates.<doc-sep>",

         "Schizophrenia: a study comparing a family therapy group following a paradoxical model plus psychodrugs and a group treated by the conventional clinical approach.<doc-sep>A 'short family therapy' in schizophrenia, according to a specific systemic model (the 'Elementary Pragmatic Model' or EPM) with a strong paradoxical structure is presented. A total of 38 schizophrenic patients, randomly allocated, were treated according to the EPM model combined with psychotropic drugs (19 cases, each of whom underwent 10 weekly sessions of family therapy) or a traditional clinical-pharmacological approach (19 cases). With regard to all measures (number of drop-outs, symptoms according to the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale, social activity according to the Strauss-Carpenter Outcome Scale and an interactive test) the EPM group showed better results. It is suggested that the systemic approach could be used not only as an effective therapy model in schizophrenia but also as an intervention in addition to or integrated into an ongoing psychoeducational family therapy.<doc-sep>Randomized controlled trial of motivational interviewing, cognitive behavior therapy, and family intervention for patients with comorbid schizophrenia and substance use disorders.<doc-sep>Comorbidity of substance abuse disorders with schizophrenia is associated with a greater risk for serious illness complications and poorer outcome. Methodologically sound studies investigating treatment approaches for patients with these disorders are rare, although recommendations for integrated and comprehensive treatment programs abound. This study investigates the relative benefit of adding an integrated psychological and psychosocial treatment program to routine psychiatric care for patients with schizophrenia and substance use disorders.\n                The authors conducted a randomized, single-blind controlled comparison of routine care with a program of routine care integrated with motivational interviewing, cognitive behavior therapy, and family or caregiver intervention.\n                The integrated treatment program resulted in significantly greater improvement in patients' general functioning than routine care alone at the end of treatment and 12 months after the beginning of the study. Other benefits of the program included a reduction in positive symptoms and in symptom exacerbations and an increase in the percent of days of abstinence from drugs or alcohol over the 12-month period from baseline to follow-up.\n                These findings demonstrate the effectiveness of a program of routine care integrated with motivational interviewing, cognitive behavior therapy, and family intervention over routine psychiatric care alone for patients with comorbid schizophrenia and alcohol or drug abuse or dependence.<doc-sep>The impact of therapeutic relatives' groups on the course of illness of schizophrenic patients.<doc-sep>This study considers the question of whether relapse rates among schizophrenic patients can be reduced by means of relatives' groups. In a randomized, controlled intervention study, two therapeutic strategies (therapeutic relatives' groups, initiated relatives' self-help groups) were compared with each other and with a control group. Interventions were confined to the relatives, with the patients continuing their standard treatment. The study involved 151 relatives of 99 chronic DSMIII schizophrenics. Data were collected before and after a 1-year intervention phase and in a 2-year follow-up. No difference existed between the groups with respect to rehospitalization data. However, numerous differences recorded in the psychopathological findings and in living and working circumstances suggest that therapeutic work with relatives is of clinically significant benefit.<doc-sep>Educating relatives about schizophrenia.<doc-sep>An education program, which was part of a controlled trial of intervention with families of schizophrenic patients, is described and evaluated. The evidence suggests that this kind of education has a role to play in psychosocial intervention. Assessment of its impact should include not only changes in information acquired but also in attitudes.<doc-sep>Counseling caregivers of relatives with schizophrenia: themes, interventions, and caveats.<doc-sep>As part of a controlled study of the effectiveness of a counseling program for family caregivers of patients with schizophrenia, we conducted a comprehensive examination of the process. The particular foci were on themes that arose during sessions, principal therapeutic interventions offered, and caveats for counselors working in the field. The most striking finding was the diverse range of themes, covering personal, coping, family, and social aspects of the caregiving experience. This required a correspondingly broad array of interventions. The implications are clear: confining counseling for caregivers to such traditional dimensions as education or attempts to reduce emotional expressiveness denies them the opportunity to deal with other equally relevant concerns.<doc-sep>Family psychoeducational support groups in schizophrenia.<doc-sep>Family members of 55 patients with schizophrenia were randomly assigned to a psychoeducational support group or to a control group. Support group participants showed greater knowledge of schizophrenia and greater satisfaction with health care services than did control group members. Psychological distress, coping behavior, and family satisfaction did not appear affected by support group participation; nor were support groups associated with lower rehospitalization rates for patients.<doc-sep>The Sydney intervention trial: a controlled trial of relatives' counselling to reduce schizophrenic relapse.<doc-sep>The result of a psychosocial intervention which aimed to reduce schizophrenic relapse through relatives' counselling is presented. Thirty-six schizophrenic patients living in high Expressed Emotion (EE) parental households were randomly allocated to an intervention or control group. The parents of patients allocated to the intervention were offered ten weekly sessions of counselling. The patient was not included in these sessions. Patients in both groups received standard after-care of medication and support. Relapses in the intervention group, although fewer, were not significantly different from the control group. Given the impressive evidence in favour of family interventions in reducing relapse rates in schizophrenic patients possible reasons for this result are discussed. Aspects of the intervention described here, exclusion of the patient, no control over the patients' medication or involvement with their management, short duration of intervention and lack of individual assessment, could explain this finding. This negative result is important in indicating what factors should be included in an effective psychosocial intervention.<doc-sep>Three-year trials of personal therapy among schizophrenic patients living with or independent of family, I: Description of study and effects on relapse rates.<doc-sep>The study of individual psychotherapeutic approaches to the treatment of schizophrenia has yielded equivocal findings, partly because of methodologic problems. Further, the ability of psychosocial treatments to prevent psychotic relapse appears to lessen over time. The authors' goal was to develop and test a demonstrably effective individual therapy for schizophrenia.\n                Using a study design that addressed previous methodologic issues, the authors evaluated personal therapy specifically designed to forestall late relapse in patients with schizophrenia. They evaluated the effectiveness of personal therapy over a period of 3 years after hospital discharge among 151 patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder diagnosed according to Research Diagnostic Criteria. The patients were randomly assigned to receive either personal therapy or contrasting therapies in one of two concurrent trials. One trial studied patients who were living with family (N = 97); the other studied patients who were living independent of family (N = 54).\n                All of the patients had extensive psychiatric histories, but only 44 (29%) experienced recurrent psychotic episodes over the 3-year study period, and only 27 (18%) prematurely terminated the study; most of those who left the study were in the no-personal-therapy conditions. Among patients living with family, personal therapy was more effective than family and supportive therapies in preventing psychotic and affective relapse as well as noncompliance. However, among patients living independent of family, those who received personal therapy had significantly more psychotic decompensations than did those who received supportive therapy.\n                Personal therapy had a positive effect on adverse outcomes among patients who lived with family. However, personal therapy increased the rate of psychotic relapse for patients living independent of family. The application of personal therapy might best be delayed until patients have achieved symptom and residential stability.<doc-sep>Patient functioning and family burden in a controlled, real-world trial of family psychoeducation for schizophrenia.<doc-sep>This study explored the effectiveness of a psychoeducational family intervention for schizophrenia on patients' personal and social functioning as well as on relatives' burden and perceived support.\n                Thirty-four mental health professionals from 17 public mental health centers in Italy selected 71 families of consumers with schizophrenia. Forty-two families were randomly assigned to a group that received the intervention for six months, and 29 families were assigned to a waiting list for six months. At baseline and six months later, validated tools were used to assess patients' clinical status, personal and social functioning, and social network as well as relatives' burden, social resources, and perception of professional support.\n                In the intervention group the number of patients with poor or very poor global personal and social functioning decreased significantly, from 17 (47 percent) at baseline to nine (25 percent) at follow-up. A significant improvement was found for the intervention group in patients' social relationships, interests in obtaining a job, maintenance of social interests, and management of social conflicts. Twenty-seven patients (74 percent) reported that their social relationships had improved during the six-month period. For both the intervention and control groups, family burden significantly improved. Relatives' social contacts and perception of professional support significantly increased only in the intervention group.\n                The results suggest that a psychoeducational family intervention may have a significant impact on functional outcomes of schizophrenia when provided to patients and caregivers in real-world settings.<doc-sep>A trial of family therapy v. a relatives group for schizophrenia.<doc-sep>Schizophrenic patients living in high contact with relatives having high expressed emotion (EE) were recruited for a trial of social interventions. The patients were maintained on neuroleptic medication, while their families were randomly assigned to education plus family therapy or education plus a relatives group. Eleven out of 12 families accepted family therapy in the home, whereas only six out of 11 families were compliant with the relatives group. Non-compliance was associated with a poorer outcome for the patients in terms of the relapse rate. The relapse rate over nine months in the family therapy stream was 8%, while that in compliant families in the relatives group stream was 17%. Patients' social functioning showed small, non-significant, gains. The data from the current trial were compared with data from a previous trial. The lowering of the relapse rate in schizophrenia appears to be mediated by reductions in relatives' EE and/or face-to-face contact, and is not explained by better compliance with medication. Reduction in EE and/or contact was associated with a minuscule relapse rate (5%). Very little change occurred in families who were non-compliant with the relatives group. On the basis of these findings, we recommend that the most cost-effective procedure is to establish relatives groups in conjunction with family education and one or more initial family therapy sessions in the home. It is particularly important to offer home visits to families who are unable to or refuse to attend the relatives groups.<doc-sep>The community management of schizophrenia. A controlled trial of a behavioural intervention with families to reduce relapse.<doc-sep>Schizophrenic patients were recruited into a trial of a prophylactic behavioural intervention with families. Families with at least one high Expressed Emotion (EE) relative were randomly allocated to one of four intervention groups: Behavioural Intervention Enactive; Behavioural Intervention Symbolic; Education Only; Routine Treatment. Patients from low-EE families were randomly allocated to two groups: Education Only or Routine Treatment. Relapse rates over nine months after discharge were significantly lower for patients in the two Behavioural Intervention, compared with Education Only and Routine Treatment groups. There was little difference between the two low-EE groups. Patients returning to high-EE relatives showed significantly higher relapse rates than those returning to low-EE relatives, in groups not receiving active intervention. Changes from high to low EE occurred in the Behavioural Intervention groups, and similar although less extensive changes occurred in the Education Only and Routine Treatment groups. Changes in criticism and marked emotional over-involvement (EOI) occurred generally in high-EE groups but were larger in magnitude in the Enactive and Symbolic groups. Reduction of hostility only occurred in the Behavioural Intervention groups. These results give partial support for the causal role of EE in relapse. There were no significant differences between the groups with respect to contact with the psychiatric services or medication.<doc-sep>Family treatment for schizophrenia : the design and research application of therapist training models.<doc-sep>The NIMH Treatment Strategies in Schizophrenia (TSS) collaborative study group investigated the efficacy of antisychotic drug maintenance strategies involving reduced medication exposure in interaction with applied and supportive family management for the long-term treatment of schizophrenia. Therapy was provided at five centers by 25 clinicians who did not participate in the development of the therapies. They were trained by two of the authors, I.R.H.F and C.W.M, in applied family management, a homebased treatment derived from the behavioral family therapy developed by them. Clinicians' characteristics, selection, and training methods, as well as patient rehospitalization rates, are reported for the two family management conditions. The TSS study represents a bridge between the development of a novel therapy and its dissemination in general clinical practice.<doc-sep>Family interventions for schizophrenia in Italy: randomized controlled trial.<doc-sep>To evaluate the effectiveness of multiple group family treatment for Schizophrenia.\n                Relatives were randomly provided with an informative programme (n = 50), or allocated to receive an additional support programme (n = 26). Patients did not attend the programme to overcome cultural and organizational implementation barriers. The 12 and 24 months clinical and family outcomes were assessed.\n                Patients' compliance with standard care was greater at 12 months in the more intensive behavioural management group over a control group receiving treatment as usual (TAU) (n = 25). A reduction in levels of expressed emotion (EE), significantly more frequent in those receiving the additional support programme than just the informative, occurred after treatment completion. Other clinical and family outcomes did not differ. However, treatment benefits declined at 24 months, when baseline high EE was again predictive of patient's admission and relatives were more vulnerable to objective burden. Baseline illness severity variables predicted a number of medium and long-term poor clinical outcomes.\n                Although family psychoeducation has been tested in a wide range of Anglo-Saxon settings, there remains need to assess outcomes more internationally. Effective family interventions for people with schizophrenia probably require continued administration of key-elements or ongoing informal support to deal with the vicissitudes of illnesses.<doc-sep>Multiple-family group treatment for English- and Vietnamese-speaking families living with schizophrenia.<doc-sep>This study, which was the first evaluation in Australia of multiple-family group treatment, explored the effectiveness of this approach for a newly arrived non-English speaking migrant group, first-generation Vietnamese families, and for English-speaking families.\n                Thirty-four pairs of English-speaking consumers and family members and 25 Vietnamese-speaking pairs were randomly assigned to a multiple-family group or a control group. All consumers had a diagnosis of schizophrenia. The multiple-family group intervention (26 sessions over 12 months) was delivered as an adjunct to case management services, which all consumers received. Outcomes, which were measured immediately after treatment and 18 months later, included the number of relapse episodes; the presence and severity of symptoms, as measured by the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) and the Scale for the Assessment of Negative Symptoms; and social functioning, as measured by the Family Burden Scale, the Health of the Nation Outcome Scale, and the Quality of Life Scale.\n                Relapse rates immediately after treatment were significantly lower for the multiple-family group than for the control group (12 and 36 percent), and relapse rates were also lower during the follow-up period (25 and 63 percent). BPRS ratings were significantly lower for participants in the multiple-family group, and vocational outcomes also improved. The reductions in relapse and symptoms were similar for the English-speaking and the Vietnamese-speaking family groups; sample size precluded statistical analysis of differences.\n                Multiple-family group treatment is an effective cognitive-behavioral intervention in the treatment of schizophrenia. The findings suggest continued application of and research on family interventions for non-English speaking migrant populations.<doc-sep>Family-based intervention for schizophrenic patients in China. A randomised controlled trial.<doc-sep>We developed and evaluated a comprehensive, ongoing intervention for families of schizophrenic patients appropriate for China's complex family relationships and unique social environment.\n                Sixty-three DSM-III-R schizophrenic patients living with family members were enrolled when admitted to hospital and randomly assigned to receive standard care or a family-based intervention that included monthly 45-minute counselling sessions focused on the management of social and occupational problems, medication management, family education, family group meetings, and crisis intervention.\n                At 6, 12, and 18-month follow-ups by blind evaluators, the proportion of subjects rehospitalised was lower, the duration of rehospitalisation was shorter, and the duration of employment was longer in the experimental group than in the control group; these differences were statistically significant at the 12 and 18-month follow-ups and were not explained by differences in drug compliance. Family intervention was associated with significantly lower levels of family burden.\n                This intervention is less costly than standard treatment, is suitable for urban families of schizophrenic patients in China and feasible given the constraints of the Chinese mental health system.<doc-sep>A randomized controlled trial of a mutual support group for family caregivers of patients with schizophrenia.<doc-sep>This randomized controlled trial examined the effectiveness of a 12-session mutual support group conducted over 3-months for Chinese family caregivers of a relative with schizophrenia compared with routine family support services in Hong Kong. Forty-eight family caregivers from two psychiatric outpatient clinics were allocated randomly to an experimental (mutual support and usual outpatient care) group (n = 24) or a control (usual outpatient care only) group (n = 24). Data were collected prior to, 1 week and 3 months after the intervention. Families allocated to the mutual support group experienced decreased levels of family burden and increased family functioning and these changes were significantly greater than those of the controls at both post-intervention time points. The experimental group also showed a significant decrease in the duration of patient re-hospitalization (the total number of days of psychiatric hospitalization) at 3 months compared with the control group. This suggests that the mutual support group provided a more responsive service for patients than standard care. However, there was no significant difference in family service utilization between the two groups. The findings indicate that a mutual support group can provide benefits for family caregivers of people with schizophrenia that go beyond those provided by routine family support.\n                Copyright 2004 Elsevier Ltd.<doc-sep>Service use among patients with schizophrenia in psychoeducational multiple-family group treatment.<doc-sep>Outpatient and inpatient mental health service outcomes for outpatients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder who received psychoeducational multiple-family group treatment were compared with outcomes for similar patients who received standard care.\n                A total of 106 outpatients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder who were receiving services from a large community mental health center were randomly assigned to receive standard care or standard care plus multiple-family group treatment. The two-year multiple-family intervention consisted of weekly group sessions designed to educate patients and their family members about the biological basis of mental illness and treatment, to improve illness management and coping skills, and to provide social support. The group sessions were conducted by two clinicians using a standardized protocol. Each multiple-family group included five to eight families and consumers. Service records for the year before and after random assignment to the study groups were examined in an intent-to-treat analysis.\n                During the year after random assignment to study groups, multiple-family group treatment was associated with a lower rate of psychiatric hospitalization than standard care. It was only marginally associated with lower use of crisis services, and it was not associated with the amount of outpatient service time.\n                The findings suggest that implementation of multiple-family group treatment in a capitated community mental health setting improves hospitalization outcomes without increasing the overall volume of outpatient mental health services.<doc-sep>An exploratory randomised controlled trial of a support programme for carers of patients with a psychosis.<doc-sep>Despite an acknowledgement of the impact of serious mental disorders on informal caregivers, we still know little about how to best help them. The aim of the study was to evaluate the effectiveness of a two-phased carers' intervention comprising family sessions followed by relatives' groups. This intervention was designed to be of 'intermediate' intensity, that is,one lying between brief educational programmes and long-term family psychoeducational treatments.\n                An exploratory randomised controlled trial was conducted comparing the experimental support programme with 'standard' care. All carers of patients with a psychotic disorder from a defined population were approached. Outcome measures were based on a 'stress-appraisal-coping' model of caregiving.\n                Despite concerted attempts to engage carers, only 42% participated in the study. The carers' programme did not offer any significant advantage on any of the outcome measures: psychological morbidity, negative appraisal, coping or social support. The severity of caregiving difficulties decreased over the study period for the group as a whole.\n                There is still uncertainty about the most effective interventions for carers. Meeting 'needs' may not improve caregiver distress.<doc-sep>A randomized controlled trial of a brief intervention for families of patients with a first episode of psychosis.<doc-sep>Carers' satisfaction with psychiatric services related to information and advice is generally poor. This may be particularly true for services trying to meet the needs of ethnically diverse communities. It is important that services attempt to ameliorate carers' concerns as early as possible. The authors aimed to assess the impact of a brief educational and advice support service on carers of patients with a first episode of psychotic illness.\n                Carers of all patients identified with a first episode of psychosis in a defined psychiatric catchment area of North London were invited to participate. Following consent from patients and relatives, relatives were randomly allocated to receive (in addition to usual services) a brief intervention comprising education and advice about the disorder from a support team or to usual care from community psychiatric services.\n                One hundred and six carers were recruited to the study. Take-up of the intervention was less than expected and the intervention had little impact. The authors found no differences over time between the randomized arms for relatives' satisfaction (F = 23, p = 0 .4, df = 1) or number of days spent by patients in hospital over nine months from entry to the trial (F= 1.7, p= 0.18, df = 1).\n                It was found that the support and advice intervention for families had little impact on their satisfaction or on patients' outcomes. However, failure to take up the intervention threatens the conclusions as the power to show an effect was reduced. Although family interventions, in general, are considered an important adjunct to the treatment of patients with chronic psychosis, there may be difficulties in providing an educational and support intervention shortly after first onset. How and when psychiatric services provide information and advice to carers of people newly diagnosed with a psychosis requires further study.<doc-sep>A program for relapse prevention in schizophrenia: a controlled study.<doc-sep>This study examined whether a program for relapse prevention (PRP) is more effective than treatment as usual (TAU) in reducing relapse and rehospitalization rates among outpatients with schizophrenia.\n                Eighty-two outpatients with DSM-III-R schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder were randomly assigned to receive either PRP (experimental group, n = 41) or TAU (control group, n = 41) and were followed up for an 18-month prospective controlled study. Patients in both groups were prescribed standard doses of maintenance antipsychotic medication. Treatment with PRP consisted of a combination of psychoeducation, active monitoring for prodromal symptoms with clinical intervention when such symptoms occurred, weekly group therapy for patients, and multifamily groups. The TAU consisted of biweekly individual supportive therapy and medication management.\n                Outcome rates over 18 months were 17% for relapse (7 patients) and 22% for rehospitalization (9 patients) in the PRP group, compared with 34% for relapse (14 patients) and 39% for rehospitalization (16 patients) in the TAU group (P = .01 and P = .03, respectively). Addition of age, sex, baseline Global Assessment Scale score, Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale scores (3 measures), and substance abuse to the proportional hazards regression models all yielded nonsignificant effects. The PRP teams were much more likely than the TAU psychiatrists to identify prodromal episodes before patients met objective relapse criteria or needed hospitalization.\n                The PRP was effective in detecting prodromal symptoms of relapse early in an episode. Crisis intervention including increased antipsychotic medication use during the prodromal phase reduced relapse and rehospitalization rates.<doc-sep>Patient and relative education in community psychiatry: a randomized controlled trial regarding its effectiveness.<doc-sep>Family psychoeducation has a well-documented effect on the short-term prognosis in schizophrenia. Less is known about the effectiveness of shorter programmes with the main focus on information for patients (patient education) or for patients and relatives (family education).\n                A randomized study of the effectiveness of an eight-session psychoeducational programme for patients with schizophrenia and for their relatives was conducted in two community mental health centres, in Arhus and Viborg (Denmark). Patient outcome measures were knowledge, relapse, compliance, insight and satisfaction, and relative outcome measures were knowledge and satisfaction. Post-intervention outcome and follow-up evaluation 1 year after the start of the intervention are presented.\n                A statistically significant increase in knowledge of schizophrenia in both relatives and patients was demonstrated at postintervention and a non-significant trend at 1-year follow-up. Statistically significant changes in the Verona Service Satisfaction Scale Scores in the subdimension of satisfaction with Relatives involvement were demonstrated both for patients and relatives postintervention and for patients at 1-year follow-up. There was a tendency that time-to-relapse increased in the intervention group at postintervention and that the schizophrenia subscore of the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale was reduced in the intervention group at 1-year follow-up. No differences were found between the groups regarding compliance, insight into psychosis, psychosocial function (General Assessment of Function) or in relatives' expressed emotion scores postintervention or at 1-year follow-up.\n                A short patient and relative education programme seems to be able to influence knowledge and some aspects of satisfaction, but does not seem to be sufficient to influence important variables such as relapse, compliance, psychopathology, insight or psychosocial functioning.<doc-sep>Parental affective style and the treatment of schizophrenia. Predicting course of illness and social functioning.<doc-sep>In a randomized controlled study, the affective style (AS) of parents of schizophrenics in clinic-based individual treatment groups and home-based family treatment groups was compared prior to treatment and again three months after treatment had begun. Affective style is an index reflecting the quality of the family emotional climate, measured from face-to-face discussion. Pretherapy and posttherapy measures of negative AS were significantly predictive of relapse within the nine-month treatment period for patients in individual treatment. In addition, for both treatment groups, a negative AS pattern at the posttherapy reassessment was significantly associated with decreased patient social functioning, reduced ability of the family to absorb the family intervention, and lower capacity of the family to cope with everyday family stresses. The results suggest that AS is an important intrafamilial attribute, with implications for treatment strategy and planning.<doc-sep>Multiple-family groups and psychoeducation in the treatment of schizophrenia.<doc-sep>To compare outcomes in psychoeducational multiple-family group treatment vs psychoeducational single-family treatment.\n                A total of 172 acutely psychotic patients, aged 18 to 45 years, with DSM-III-R schizophrenic disorders were randomly assigned to single- or multiple-family psychoeducational treatment at six public hospitals in the state of New York. Psychotic relapse, symptom status, medication compliance, rehospitalization, and employment were assessed independently during 2 years of supervised treatment.\n                The multiple-family groups yielded significantly lower 2-year cumulative relapse rates than did the single-family modality (16% vs 27%) and achieved markedly lower rates in patients whose conditions had not remitted at index hospital discharge (13% vs 33%). The relapse hazard ratio between treatments was 1:3. The relapse rate for both modalities was less than half the expected rate (65% to 80% for 2 years) for patients receiving individual treatment and medication. Rehospitalization rates and psychotic symptoms decreased significantly, and medication compliance was high, to an equal degree in both modalities.\n                Psychoeducational multiple-family groups were more effective than single-family treatment in extending remission, especially in patients at higher risk for relapse, with a cost-benefit ratio of up to 1:34.<doc-sep>Behavioural family management in schizophrenia.

         "A comparison of proximal femoral nail antirotation and dynamic hip screw devices in trochanteric fractures.<doc-sep>This prospective, randomized study compared the functional outcome and complications associated with a proximal femoral nail antirotation (PFNA) device with those of a traditional extramedullary device, the dynamic hip screw (DHS), in patients with trochanteric fracture. A total of 121 patients were randomized to the PFNA group (n = 58) or the DHS group (n = 63). Perioperative information and complications were recorded, and assessments of functional outcome were made. The DHS group required a longer operative time and was associated with greater blood loss than the PFNA group. The re-operation rate was lower in the PFNA group compared with the DHS group, especially in patients with unstable fractures, although there was no statistically significant difference in the overall complication rate between the two groups. There were no significant differences in functional outcome between the PFNA and the DHS groups. In conclusion, the PFNA device is useful in the treatment of trochanteric fractures.<doc-sep>Intertrochanteric fractures of the femur: a randomized prospective comparison of the Gamma nail and the Ambi hip screw.<doc-sep>The Gamma nail has been introduced as an advance over the Ambi hip screw in intertrochanteric femoral fractures. Its efficacy in an Australasian setting has not been documented.\n                A prospective randomized study was used to compare the Ambi hip screw and the Gamma nail for the treatment of 69 patients over the age of 50 years with intertrochanteric femoral fractures. The groups were similar with respect to age, sex, prefracture mobility and abode, anaesthetic risk grade, CT measured bone density and fracture pattern.\n                Those treated with the Gamma nail had a significantly longer image intensifier screening time (P < 0.05), greater blood loss (P < 0.01) and more operative complications. There was no difference in the length of hospital stay but the level of mobility recovered was significantly better in the Ambi group at 6 months follow up. Urine retention was the most frequent complication but did not correlate with the implant or method of anaesthesia. Two implants cut out, one in each group. Limb shortening was similar in both groups and was not affected by leaving the Gamma nail unlocked distally in unstable fractures. Thirteen patients died from pre-existing medical conditions.\n                The Gamma nail proved technically more demanding with higher intra-operative complications and inferior return of mobility.<doc-sep>Prospective randomized controlled trial of an intramedullary nail versus dynamic screw and plate for intertrochanteric fractures of the femur.<doc-sep>To compare the surgical complications and functional outcome of the Gamma nail intramedullary fixation device versus the Richards sliding hip screw and plate device in intertrochanteric femoral fractures.\n                A prospective, randomised controlled clinical trial with observer blinding.\n                A regional teaching hospital in the United Kingdom.\n                All patients admitted from the local population with intertrochanteric fractured femurs were included. There were 400 patients entered into the study and 399 followed-up to one year or death.\n                The devices were assigned by randomization to either a short-type Gamma nail (203 patients) or a Richard's-type sliding hip screw and plate (197 patients).\n                The main surgical outcome measurements were fixation failure and reoperation. A functional outcome of pain, mobility status, and range of movement were assessed until one year.\n                The requirement for revision in the Gamma nail group was twelve (6%); for Richard's group, eight (4%). This was not statistically different (p = 0.29; odds ratio, 1.48 [0.59-3.7]). A subcapital femoral fracture occurred in the Richard's group. Femoral shaft fractures occurred with four in the Gamma nail group (2%) and none in the Richard's group (p = 0.13). Three required revision to another implant. Lag-screw cut-out occurred in eight patients in the gamma nail group (4%) and four in the Richard's group (2%). This was not statistically significant (p = 0.37; odds ratio, 2.29 [0.6-9.0]). The development of other postoperative complications was the same in both groups. There was no difference between the two groups in terms of early or long-term functional status at one year.\n                The use of an intramedullary device in the treatment of intertrochanteric femoral fractures is still associated with a higher but nonsignificant risk of postoperative complications. Routine use of the Gamma nail in this type of fracture cannot be recommended over the current standard treatment of dynamic hip screw and plate.<doc-sep>Fixation of intertrochanteric fractures of the femur. A randomised prospective comparison of the gamma nail and the dynamic hip screw.<doc-sep>We have prospectively compared the fixation of 100 intertrochanteric fractures of the proximal femur in elderly patients with random use of either a Dynamic Hip Screw (DHS) or a new intramedullary device, the Gamma nail. We found no difference in operating time, blood loss, wound complications, stay in hospital, place of eventual discharge, or the patients' mobility at final review. There was no difference in failure of proximal fixation: cut-out occurred in three cases with the DHS, and twice with the Gamma nail. However, in four cases fracture of the femur occurred close to the Gamma nail, requiring further major surgery. In the absence of these complications, union was seen by six months in both groups.<doc-sep>Comparison of dynamic hip screw and gamma nail: a prospective, randomized, controlled trial.<doc-sep>We report a prospective, randomized, controlled trial, comparing the results of treatment with a dynamic hip screw (DHS) and a gamma nail in 95 consecutive patients with peri-trochanteric fractures of the femur. The DHS was used in 48 patients, the gamma nail in 47. Clinical and radiological outcomes were similar, but the gamma nail was associated with a higher incidence of complications, in particular fracture of the femur below the implant in eight cases. This is consistent with previous reports, and we do not recommend the gamma nail for the treatment of peri-trochanteric femoral fractures.<doc-sep>A prospective trial comparing the Holland nail with the dynamic hip screw in the treatment of intertrochanteric fractures of the hip.<doc-sep>We compared the outcome of patients treated for an intertrochanteric fracture of the femoral neck with a locked, long intramedullary nail with those treated with a dynamic hip screw (DHS) in a prospective randomised study. Each patient who presented with an extra-capsular hip fracture was randomised to operative stabilisation with either a long intramedullary Holland nail or a DHS. We treated 92 patients with a Holland nail and 98 with a DHS. Pre-operative variables included the Mini Mental test score, patient mobility, fracture pattern and American Society of Anesthesiologists grading. Peri-operative variables were anaesthetic time, operating time, radiation time and blood loss. Post-operative variables were time to mobilising with a frame, wound infection, time to discharge, time to fracture union, and mortality. We found no significant difference in the pre-operative variables. The mean anaesthetic and operation times were shorter in the DHS group than in the Holland nail group (29.7 vs 40.4 minutes, p < 0.001; and 40.3 vs 54 minutes, p < 0.001, respectively). There was an increased mean blood loss within the DHS group versus the Holland nail group (160 ml vs 78 ml, respectively, p < 0.001). The mean time to mobilisation with a frame was shorter in the Holland nail group (DHS 4.3 days, Holland nail 3.6 days, p = 0.012). More patients needed a post-operative blood transfusion in the DHS group (23 vs seven, p = 0.003) and the mean radiation time was shorter in this group (DHS 0.9 minutes vs Holland nail 1.56 minutes, p < 0.001). The screw of the DHS cut out in two patients, one of whom underwent revision to a Holland nail. There were no revisions in the Holland nail group. All fractures in both groups were united when followed up after one year. We conclude that the DHS can be implanted more quickly and with less exposure to radiation than the Holland nail. However, the resultant blood loss and need for transfusion is greater. The Holland nail allows patients to mobilise faster and to a greater extent. We have therefore adopted the Holland nail as our preferred method of treating intertrochanteric fractures of the hip.<doc-sep>[Classic nail versus DHS. A prospective randomised study of fixation of trochanteric femur fractures].<doc-sep>The intramedullary hip screw system Classic-Nail and the Dynamic Hip Screw (DHS) were evaluated in a prospective-randomized clinical trial for operative treatment of trochanteric femur fractures. Hundred and ten geriatric patients (mean age 82 years) were runningly included in the study (56 Classic Nail, 54 DHS). No significant differences between the two study groups were observed with regard to treatment and follow-up data. With the Classic-Nail one complete femur shaft fracture and one incomplete fracture occurred at the tip of the nail intraoperatively and could successfully be fixed with cerclage wires. In the DHS group two patients underwent reoperation for significant loss of reduction early postoperatively. At an average follow-up of 3.7 months all fractures were healed with no difference in functional outcome between the two groups.--Classic Nail and DHS both lead to equally good results in the operative treatment of trochanteric femur fractures.<doc-sep>The trochanteric gamma nail versus the dynamic hip screw: a prospective randomised study. One-year follow-up of 146 intertrochanteric fractures.<doc-sep>In a prospective, randomized trial we compared the trochanteric gamma nail (TGN) and the dynamic hip screw (DHS) in the treatment of 146 intertrochanteric fractures. Follow-up was after four and 12 months. The operation time was significantly shorter in the DHS group. At discharge the need for walking aids was less in the DHS group. There were no differences in intraoperative blood loss, medical complications, mortality or length of hospital stay. Major fracture complications occurred twiceas often in the TGN group compared with the DHS group, however they were not statistically significant. Any potential for the TGN leading to a less invasive procedure and a more rapid postoperative mobilisation could not be demonstrated. Compared with the TGN we prefer the DHS for most intertrochanteric fractures in a setting where the majority of these fractures are treated by younger doctors and not by highly specialized hip/trauma surgeons. The TGN may have advantages in selected intertrochanteric fractures.;<doc-sep>Intramedullary versus extramedullary fixation for the treatment of intertrochanteric hip fractures.<doc-sep>One hundred thirty-one patients (135 fractures) who sustained an intertrochanteric fracture were assigned randomly to treatment with either a sliding hip screw or an intramedullary hip screw and followed up prospectively. In patients with unstable intertrochanteric fractures, the intramedullary device was associated with 23% less surgical time and 44% less blood loss; however, use of the intramedullary hip screw in patients who had a stable fracture pattern required 70% greater fluoroscopic time. Intraoperative complications occurred exclusively in patients in the intramedullary hip screw group. There were no differences in the rates of functional recovery between the two fixation groups.<doc-sep>Treatment of intertrochanteric fracture with the Gamma AP locking nail or by a compression hip screw--a randomised prospective trial.<doc-sep>The Gamma AP (Asia-Pacific) locking nail (GAPN) is a modification of the standard Gamma locking nail made especially for use in Oriental patients. We made a randomised prospective comparison of the compression hip screw (CHS) and the Gamma AP locking nail for the internal fixation of 60 intertrochanteric fractures of the hip in elderly patients by comparing perioperative details and analysing the radiographic and clinical results. The operation time for the GAPN group was shorter than for the CHS group and the intraoperative blood loss was lower. The Gamma AP nail enabled earlier mobilisation. We found no significant difference in the time to union and the length of sliding of the lag screw between the two groups. The decrease in the neck shaft angle in the Gamma nail group was significantly smaller than in the CHS patients. There were no significant mechanical complications, such as fracture of the femoral shaft or failure of fixation in the Gamma nail group. On the basis of our observations we conclude that the Gamma AP locking nail is more efficient than the CHS in the treatment of intertrochanteric fractures in geriatric patients.<doc-sep>Use of an intramedullary hip-screw compared with a compression hip-screw with a plate for intertrochanteric femoral fractures. A prospective, randomized study of one hundred patients.<doc-sep>One hundred elderly patients who had an intertrochanteric femoral fracture were randomized to treatment with a compression hip-screw with a plate (fifty patients) or a new intramedullary device, the intramedullary hip-screw (fifty patients). All patients were followed prospectively for one year or until death. A detailed assessment of the functional status and the plain radiographs of the hip was performed one, three, six, and twelve months postoperatively. The two treatment groups were strictly comparable. The operative time needed to insert the intramedullary hip-screw was significantly greater than that needed to insert the compression hip-screw with the plate (p = 0.02), but use of the intramedullary hip-screw was associated with less estimated intraoperative blood loss (p = 0.011). The prevalence of perioperative complications, such as bronchopneumonia, cardiac failure, and urinary tract infection, was comparable in the two treatment groups. There were one intraoperative fracture of the femoral shaft and two intraoperative fractures of the greater trochanter in the group managed with the intramedullary hip-screw. One patient had pulling-out of the compression hip-screw on the seventh postoperative day. Four patients had a trochanteric wound hematoma, without infection, after insertion of an intramedullary hip-screw. All but one of the fractures healed. The one non-union, which was in a patient who had a compression hip-screw, was treated with a hemiarthroplasty. The mortality rate was similar in the two treatment groups. The patients who had an intramedullary hip-screw had, on the average, significantly better mobility at one (p < 0.0001) and three months (p = 0.0013) postoperatively. This difference was no longer seen at six and twelve months, although the patients who had an intramedullary hip-screw still had significantly better walking ability outside the home at those time-periods (p = 0.05). The compression hip-screw was removed from two patients because of pain in the mid-portion of the thigh, which had begun after consolidation of the fracture. Fourteen patients who had an intramedullary hip-screw had cortical hypertrophy at the level of the tip of the nail at twelve months postoperatively. Cortical hypertrophy was significantly related to the use of two interlocking screws (p = 0.02). Six of these patients also had pain in the mid-portion of the thigh, and the nail had been locked with two screws in five of them. Three of the six patients had the hardware removed because of the pain, and the symptoms resolved. A seventh patient had pain without cortical hypertrophy. The intramedullary hip-screw device was associated with significantly less sliding of the lag-screw and subsequent shortening of the limb in the region of the thigh (p = 0.012 and 0.019, respectively); these differences were more pronounced when the unstable fractures in the two treatment groups were compared (p < 0.001).<doc-sep>Intramedullary nailing versus fixed angle blade plating for subtrochanteric femoral fractures: a prospective randomised controlled trial.<doc-sep>To compare closed intramedullary nailing to open reduction and internal fixation using a fixed angle blade plate for the management of subtrochanteric femoral fractures.\n                58 patients were equally randomised to undergo either an intramedullary nailing (IN) or fixed angle blade plating (BP).\n                There were no significant differences between the 2 groups with regard to age, time to surgery, operating time, receipt of blood transfusions, duration of hospital stay, or fracture classification. The revision rate was 28% (8/29) in the BP group and none in the IN group; the difference was statistically significant.\n                Internal fixation using a fixed angle blade plate for subtrochanteric femoral fractures has higher implant failure and revision rates, compared to closed intramedullary nailing.<doc-sep>Minimally invasive osteosynthesis in stable trochanteric fractures: a comparative study between Gotfried percutaneous compression plate and Gamma 3 intramedullary nail.<doc-sep>Our objective was to compare the results of PCCP (Percutaneous Compression Plate) device and Gamma 3 nail for the treatment of stable trochanteric hip fractures and to demonstrate that PCCP device is a minimally invasive system.\n                Prospective, randomized trial. Eighty patients aged 60 and over with stable trochanteric fracture were selected and then randomized using a table of randomized numbers. Length of time of operative procedure, hemoglobin levels at 6 and 48 h after surgery, packed cells units administered, and hospital stay were recorded. In addition, the postoperative complications in the first year after the surgery was collected.\n                No differences were found in hospital stay, surgical time, blood loss, functional outcome at 1-year follow-up, neck-shaft angle, fracture collapse, and mortality.\n                PCCP and Gamma 3 have not presented significant differences in any measured parameter for treatment of stable trochanteric fractures. Therefore, the PCCP system is shown to be as minimally invasive as the Gamma 3.<doc-sep>A comparison of the long gamma nail with the sliding hip screw for the treatment of AO/OTA 31-A2 fractures of the proximal part of the femur: a prospective randomized trial.<doc-sep>Controversy exists with regard to whether to treat AO/OTA 31-A2 fractures of the proximal part of the femur with an intramedullary device or an extramedullary device. A prospective, randomized, controlled trial was performed to compare the outcome of treatment of these unstable fractures of the proximal part of the femur with either a sliding hip screw or a long gamma nail.\n                Two hundred and ten patients presenting with an AO/OTA 31-A2 fracture of the proximal part of the femur were randomized, at the time of admission, to fixation with use of either a long gamma nail or a sliding hip screw. The primary outcome measure was reoperation within the first postoperative year. Secondary measures included mortality, length of hospital stay, transfusion rate, change in mobility and residence, and quality of life as measured with the EuroQol 5D outcome score.\n                There was no significant difference between the reoperation rates for the two groups. In total, five patients (three from the long-gamma-nail group and two from the sliding-hip-screw group) underwent revision surgery because of cut-out. Tip-apex distance was found to correlate with the implant cut-out rate. There was no significant difference between the two groups in terms of the EuroQol 5D outcome scores, the mortality rates after correction for the mini-mental score, or any of the secondary outcome measures.\n                When compared with the long gamma nail, the sliding hip screw should remain the gold standard for the treatment of AO/OTA 31-A2 fractures of the proximal part of the femur because it is associated with similar outcomes with less expense.<doc-sep>A prospective randomised comparison of the dynamic hip screw and the gamma locking nail.<doc-sep>We made a randomised prospective comparison of the Dynamic Hip Screw and the Gamma locking nail for the internal fixation of 200 petrochanteric femoral fractures in elderly patients. There was less intraoperative blood loss and a lower rate of wound complications in the patients treated by the Gamma nail. They had, however, a high incidence of femoral shaft fracture which we relate in part to implant design. We do not recommend the use of the Gamma nail for these fractures.<doc-sep>Treatment of reverse oblique and transverse intertrochanteric fractures with use of an intramedullary nail or a 95 degrees screw-plate: a prospective, randomized study.<doc-sep>Intertrochanteric fractures are composed of different anatomic patterns that vary in their degree of stability following open reduction and internal fixation. A particularly unstable group is classified as AO/OTA 31-A3, with the fracture pattern described as reverse oblique or transverse. The purpose of this study was to compare the results of intramedullary fixation with those of plate fixation for these intertrochanteric fractures in elderly patients.\n                Thirty-nine elderly patients with AO/OTA 31-A3 intertrochanteric fractures of the femur were randomized into two treatment groups and were followed for a minimum of one year. The nineteen patients in Group I were treated with a 95 fixed-angle screw-plate (Dynamic Condylar Screw), and the twenty patients in Group II were treated with an intramedullary nail (Proximal Femoral Nail). The treatment groups were comparable with regard to all demographic and injury variables.\n                Patients treated with an intramedullary nail had shorter operative times, fewer blood transfusions, and shorter hospital stays compared with those treated with a 95 screw-plate. Implant failure and/or nonunion was noted in seven of the nineteen patients who had been treated with the 95 screw-plate. Only one of the twenty fractures that had been treated with an intramedullary nail did not heal.\n                The results of our study support the use of an intramedullary nail rather than a 95 screw-plate for the fixation of reverse oblique and transverse intertrochanteric fractures in elderly patients.<doc-sep>Gamma nails and dynamic hip screws for peritrochanteric fractures. A randomised prospective study in elderly patients.<doc-sep>The Gamma nail was introduced for the treatment of peritrochanteric fractures with the theoretical advantage of a load-sharing femoral component which could be implanted by a closed procedure. We report a randomised prospective study of 186 fractures treated by either the Gamma nail or a dynamic hip screw. Gamma nails were implanted with significantly shorter screening times, smaller incisions, and less intraoperative bleeding. The Gamma nail group had a shorter convalescence and earlier full weight-bearing, but there was no significant difference in mortality within six months, postoperative mobility, or hip function at review. More intra-operative complications were recorded in the Gamma nail group, mainly due to the mismatching of the femoral component of the nail to the small femurs of Chinese people. Use of a smaller modified nail reduced these complications. We conclude that with careful surgical technique and the modified femoral component, the Gamma nail is an advance in the treatment of peritrochanteric fractures.<doc-sep>A randomised comparison of AMBI, TGN and PFN for treatment of unstable trochanteric fractures.<doc-sep>In this study, we initiated a prospective, randomised, clinical trial comparing the AMBI, TGN and PFN operations used for treatment of unstable fractures, for differences in intra-operative use, consolidation, complications and functional outcome.\n                We have compared the pre-, intra- and post-operating variables of AMBI, TGN and PFN operations that were used for treatment of unstable trochanteric fractures, of 120 patients all above 60 years old diagnosed with extracapsular hip fractures classified as AO Type 31-A2 or Type 31-A3.\n                According to our results the three methods are comparable in the treatment of unstable trochanteric fractures of patients above 60 years old.\n                The AMBI remains the gold standard for the fractures of trochanteric region. TGN has an easier and faster procedure, facilitates early weight bearing and had minor late complications. An improper use of the PFN system was the reason for the most complications and the longer operation time of the device. PFN is also an accepted minimally invasive implant for unstable proximal femoral fractures but future modification of the implant to avoid Z-effect phenomenon, careful surgical technique and selection of the patients should reduce its high complication rate.<doc-sep>[Pertrochanteric fractures: a randomized prospective study comparing dynamic screw plate and intramedullary fixation].<doc-sep>The objective of this study was to compare the dynamic hip screw (Synthes) and intramedullary fixation (Targon PF, Aesculap) for the treatment of pertrochanteric fractures in terms of stability, complications and cost effectiveness.\n                This prospective randomized study included 60 patients hospitalized in an emergency setting for pertrochanteric fractures between December 2003 and June 2004. All surgeons in our unit participated in the study. Two fixation systems were used: the Targon proximal femoral nail (Aesculap) and the screw-plate dynamic hip screw (Synthes). We noted: patient status (ASA classification), operative data (type of implant, duration), postoperative data (blood loss, radiographic findings, early complications), and outcome (Harris score, time to walking, mortality). All patients were assessed three months after surgery. The series included 60 patients, 14 men (23%) and 46 women (77%). The Targon PF nail was used for 34 patients and the DHS for 26. In the intramedullary fixation group mean age was 81 years (SD = 12.8, range 23-96); it was 82 years (SD 9.8, range 47-97) in the screw-plate group. The AO classification was: intramedullary fixation 31A1 (n = 11), 31A2 (n = 20), 31A3 (n = 3); screw-plate 31A1 (n = 14), 31A2 (n = 11), 31A3 (n = 1). Thirty-one fractures were stable, 29 unstable. Unstable fractures were treated with the Targon PF nail (n = 18) and the DHS screw-plate (n = 11). Stable fractures were treated with the Targon PF nail (n = 15) and the DHS screw-plate (n = 15).\n                Mean operative time was 35 minutes for intramedullary nailing and 42 mintues for screw-plate fixation. Mean blood loss was 410 ml for intramedullary nailing and 325 ml for screw-plate fixation (p = 0.07). Mean hospital stay was the same (11 days) in both groups. At three months, mechanical complications involved migration of the cervical screw outside the femoral head for three Targon PF fixations and for two DHS fixations. Screw migration was favored by fracture instability and presence of osteoporosis. There were two deaths in the intramedullary nailing group and one in the screw-plate group. Time to walking was 20 days on average in the intramedullary nailing group and 25 days in the screw-plate group. The mean Harris hip score was 60 in the intramedullary group and 59 in the screw-plate group.\n                Data in the literature report an advantage for intramedullary nailing, particularly a mechanical advantage, for the treatment of pertrochanteric fractures. Our findings show that good results are obtained with the screw-plate fixation using the DHS with less blood loss and at a lower cost.<doc-sep>Prospective randomized comparison between a dynamic hip screw and a mini-invasive static nail in fractures of the trochanteric area: preliminary results.<doc-sep>This study aimed at comparing the results obtained with a sliding screw plate and an experimental device including a small-diameter nail that can be placed with a mini-invasive approach and provides a stable fixation.\n                Randomized prospective study.\n                University hospital.\n                The study included two groups with thirty fractures of the trochanteric area.\n                In both groups, the surgical procedure was carried out on patients placed on a traction table in a supine position, under an x-ray amplifier. Sliding screw plates (THS) were set in place according to the usual open technique. Nails were placed through a twenty-millimeter supratrochanteric cutaneous incision. This experimental system comprised a locked intramedullary nail with two nonparallel seven-millimeter cervicocephalic screws.\n                The comparison between the two groups was based on the surgical procedure (time, duration of x-ray irradiation, and total blood loss); the initial postoperative period (complications, duration of hospital stay, and the time before returning home); the time before full weight bearing became effective; the functional and social recovery; mortality; and the quality of immediate and final anatomic restitution and healing.\n                Operating time (p < 0.001) and blood loss (p < 0.001) were lower in the nail group, and no blood transfusion was required. Postoperative pain (p < 0.01), time necessary to support full weight bearing (p < 0.02), and time before returning home (p < 0.05) were reduced in the nail group. All fractures healed in the same amount of time, with good anatomic results in the nail group, whereas ten impactions beyond ten millimeters occurred in the plate group. No difference was found between the two groups in walking ability and autonomy recovery, but hip function (p < 0.05) was better in the nail group.\n                This preliminary clinical study has shown the advantages of this mini-invasive technique. It could not evaluate all the possible disadvantages inherent in the method. These points will be evaluated in a multicenter study justified by these preliminary results.<doc-sep>[The gamma-nail as a resilient alternative to the dynamic hip screw in unstable proximal femoral fractures in the elderly].<doc-sep>In a prospective randomised trial between September 1989 and June 1990 one hundred patients with per- and subtrochanteric fractures were consecutively treated by gamma-nail or DHS. The average age of both groups was about 80 years. The operation time for gamma-nailing was longer than for DHS implantation and also the postoperative blood loss was higher in the gamma-nail group. We found no difference of intraoperative blood loss, of perioperative lethality and in duration of hospital care. 90% of gamma-nail patients and 80% of DHS patients were successfully able to walk four days after operation with full weight bearing on the operated limb. Three patients in the DHS group with unstable fractures got cranial perforation of the cephalic screw mobilisation. Five patients of the gamma-nail group were reoperated, one case because of missed distal locking, one because of cranial perforation of the cephalic screw after varus dislocation of the proximal fragment. One patient suffered intraoperatively a proximal femur shaft fracture which was corrected during operation. In one case a wound hematoma was evacuated, an other patient needed secondary wound closure. Despite technical imperfection of implant and instruments, we conclude that the gamma-nail allows a very high percentage early and full weight bearing immediately after operation. So we consider that in the treatment of unstable pertrochanteric fractures of geriatric patients, the gamma-nail has proven to be more efficient than the DHS.<doc-sep>Intramedullary hip screw versus sliding hip screw for unstable intertrochanteric femoral fractures in the elderly.<doc-sep>We report a randomised, prospective study comparing a standard sliding hip screw and the intramedullary hip screw for the treatment of unstable intertrochanteric fractures in the elderly. One hundred and two patients were randomised on admission to two treatment groups. Fifty-two patients were treated with a compression hip screw (CHS), and fifty had intramedullary fixation with an intramedullary hip screw (IMHS). Patients were followed for 1 year and had a clinical and radiological review at 3, 6 and 12 months. The mean duration of operation and fluoroscopy screening time was significantly greater for insertion of the intramedullary hip screw. There was no difference between the groups with regard to transfusion requirements or time to mobilise after surgery. There were two technical complications in the CHS group and three in the IMHS group. There was no significant difference between the two groups in radiological or functional outcome at 12 months. It remains to be shown whether the theoretical advantages of intramedullary fixation of extracapsular hip fractures bring a significant improvement in eventual outcome.<doc-sep>Functional outcome in treatment of unstable trochanteric and subtrochanteric fractures with the proximal femoral nail and the Medoff sliding plate.<doc-sep>To compare outcome between the proximal femoral nail (PFN) and the Medoff sliding plate (MSP) in patients with unstable trochanteric or subtrochanteric fractures.\n                This was a consecutive prospective randomized clinical study. In all, 203 patients admitted to two university hospitals with an unstable trochanteric or a subtrochanteric fracture type were included. Surgery was performed with a short intramedullary nail or a dual-sliding plate device. Follow up visits occurred at 6 weeks, 4 months, and 12 months. Functional outcome was measured by walking ability, rising from a chair, curb test, and additional assessments of abductor strength, pain, living conditions, and complications.\n                The ability to walk 15 m at 6 weeks was significantly better in the PFN group compared to the MSP group with an odds ratio 2.2 (P = 0.04, 95% confidence limits 1.03-4.67). No statistical difference in walking ability could be found between trochanteric and subtrochanteric fractures. The major complication rate (8% in the PFN group and 4% in the MSP group) did not differ statistically (P = 0.50) but reoperations were more frequent in the PFN group (9%) compared to the MSP group (1%; P < 0.02).\n                There were no major differences in functional outcome or major complications between the treatment groups. Reasons other than the operated fracture seem to be equally important in determining the long-term functional ability of the patients in our study. An advantage with the MSP was the lower reoperation rate.<doc-sep>Systematic effects of surgical treatment of hip fractures: gliding screw-plating vs intramedullary nailing.<doc-sep>Numerous studies have been published regarding the comparison between intramedullary nail and the dynamic hip screw and plate for the fixation of intertrochanteric fractures in elderly patients. In this paper we present a comparative study of these two methods regarding their systemic effects on this group of patients.\n                This is a randomized trial of 120 consecutive patients with an intertrochanteric fracture treated with either extramedullary fixation (dynamic hip screw and plate; DHS, Synthes-Stratec, Oberdorf, Switzerland) or intramedullary nail (Gamma nail, Stryker Howmedica, Freiburg, Germany and Endovis BA, Citieffe, Bologna, Italy). The parameters that we assessed pre-operatively, in addition to their demographics, included their mental state (MMSE), their nutritional and immune state and their pulmonary function. Intra-operatively we calculated the amount of radiation exposure, the amount of blood loss and the length of operative time for each procedure. Postoperatively we repeated the calculation of the mental and pulmonary state and the blood loss, during days 1, 3, and 10 and related them to the ease of the patient's mobilization.\n                Decreased bleeding and post-operative pain, reduced post-operative morbidity and faster recovery of function were better but not significant in the group of intramedullary fixation (all p>0.05). However, in the same group there were slightly more patients in whom the MMSE was falling, together with their pulmonary function, suggesting that this method probably predisposes to higher chances of pulmonary dysfunction and the possibility of pulmonary embolism.\n                We found no significant differences between the two methods of stabilization of these fractures regarding their systemic effects perioperatively. The classic dynamic hip screw can preserve its position as a safe and effective solution for these already vulnerable patients having sustained a trochanteric fracture against the novel intramedullary techniques.\n                Copyright 2009.

A randomised study comparing post-operative rehabilitation.<doc-sep>We treated 108 patients with a pertrochanteric femoral fracture using either the dynamic hip screw or the proximal femoral nail in this prospective, randomised series. We compared walking ability before fracture, intra-operative variables and return to their residence. Patients treated with the proximal femoral nail (n = 42) had regained their pre-operative walking ability significantly (p = 0.04) more often by the four-month review than those treated with the dynamic hip screw (n = 41). Peri-operative or immediate post-operative measures of outcome did not differ between the groups, with the exception of operation time. The dynamic hip screw allowed a significantly greater compression of the fracture during the four-month follow-up, but consolidation of the fracture was comparable between the two groups. Two major losses of reduction were observed in each group, resulting in a total of four revision operations. Our results suggest that the use of the proximal femoral nail may allow a faster post-operative restoration of walking ability, when compared with the dynamic hip screw.<doc-sep>Pertrochanteric fractures: is there an advantage to an intramedullary nail?: a randomized, prospective study of 206 patients comparing the dynamic hip screw and proximal femoral nail.<doc-sep>To compare the results between a sliding compression hip screw and an intramedullary nail in the treatment of pertrochanteric fractures.\n                Prospective computer-generated randomization of 206 patients into two study groups: those treated by sliding compression hip screw (Group 1; n = 106) and those treated by intramedullary nailing (Group 2; n = 100).\n                University Level I trauma center.\n                All patients over the age of fifty-five years presenting with fractures of the trochanteric region caused by a low-energy injury, classified as AO/OTA Type 31-A1 and A2.\n                Treatment with a sliding compression hip screw (Dynamic Hip Screw; Synthes-Stratec, Oberdorf, Switzerland) or an intramedullary nail (Proximal Femoral Nail; Synthes-Stratec, Oberdorf, Switzerland).\n                Intraoperative: operative and fluoroscopy times, the difficulty of the operation, intraoperative complications, and blood loss.

Current standards of surgical fixation for the myriad possible fracture patterns include the compression hip screw (CHS), the 90 degrees/95 degrees blade plate, and locked intramedullary nails. The gamma nail (GN) was designed as a \"hybrid\" of these devices, combining theoretical biomechanical advantages that should allow earlier postoperative weight bearing with surgical technique advantages that should decrease operative morbidity. Because these theoretical advantages were unproven in a clinical setting, we prospectively randomized 75 consecutive patients with peritrochanteric femur fractures into two groups to examine the fixation of these fractures with the GN as compared to the CHS. We found no significant differences in preoperative or intraoperative parameters. Postoperatively, the subtrochanteric fracture group treated with the GN achieved earlier weightbearing status, although this was not statistically significant. 72 patients were available for follow-up at a minimum of 6 months. All fractures had clinically and radiographically healed, and 94% of the patients continued to be ambulatory. Major complications included missed distal locking screws (one patient), cutting out of the lag screw superiorly in the femoral head (two patients), and a femur fracture at the distal end of the GN (one patient). In our series, the GN produced clinical results commensurate with current standards of fixation for peritrochanteric femur fractures. Although the GN allowed earlier independent weightbearing status in patients with subtrochanteric fractures, the procedure was technically more demanding and had a significant learning curve.<doc-sep>Trochanteric gamma nail and compression hip screw for trochanteric fractures: a randomized, prospective, comparative study in 210 elderly patients with a new design of the gamma nail.<doc-sep>To compare the results between a new intramedullary Gamma nail and a compression hip screw in the treatment of trochanteric fractures.\n                Prospective randomized.\n                Level 1 trauma center.\n                Two hundred ten consecutive patients older than 65 years with trochanteric femoral fractures.\n                Treatment with a compression hip screw or a new design of the Trochanteric Gamma nail (180 mm in length with a mediolateral angle of 4 degrees and available only with a proximal diameter of 17 mm and distal diameter of 11 mm).\n                Operative and fluoroscopy times, blood loss, functional outcome, complication rate, and failure of fixation.\n                The Trochanteric Gamma nail was used in 104 patients and the compression hip screw in 106. The 2 groups were similar in terms of their preoperative data, with a median follow-up of 13.6 months (range 12-30). The results show no difference in operating time (P = 0.21), but the Trochanteric Gamma nail group had a significantly shorter fluoroscopy time (P = 0.006), and the number of patients transfused and the mean of units of blood transfused were significantly less in the Trochanteric Gamma nail group (P = 0.013, 0.046, respectively). Mortality within 12 months was similar in both groups (P = 0.83). All fractures were radiographically healed at the last visit. There was no difference in intraoperative and postoperative complications or rate of fixation failure between the 2 groups, and no case of secondary shaft fracture of the femur was encountered in this study. In the entire series, there was no difference in the functional outcome (P = 0.74), but the postoperative walking ability was better in those patients with unstable fractures who were treated with the Trochanteric Gamma nail (P = 0.017).\n                The new Trochanteric Gamma nail is an effective method for the treatment of trochanteric femoral fractures in elderly patients. The indication for either Trochanteric Gamma nail or compression hip screw is similar in stable fractures, but we recommend the use of the Trochanteric Gamma nail for unstable trochanteric fractures.<doc-sep>The standard Gamma nail or the Medoff sliding plate for unstable trochanteric and subtrochanteric fractures. A randomised, controlled trial.<doc-sep>We studied 217 patients with an unstable trochanteric or subtrochanteric fracture who had been randomly allocated to treatment by either internal fixation with a standard Gamma nail (SGN) or a Medoff sliding plate (MSP, biaxial dynamisation mode). Their mean age was 84 years (65 to 99) and they were reviewed at four and 12 months after surgery. Assessments of outcome included general complications, technical failures, revision surgery, activities of daily living (ADL), hip function (Charnley score) and the health-related quality of life (HRQOL, EQ-5D). The rate of technical failure in patients with unstable trochanteric fractures was 6.5% (6/93) (including intra-operative femoral fractures) in the SGN group and 5.2% (5/96) in the MSP group. In patients with subtrochanteric fractures, there were no failures in the SGN group (n = 16) and two in the MSP group (n = 12). In the SGN group, there were intra-operative femoral fractures in 2.8% (3/109) and no post-operative fractures. There was a reduced need for revision surgery in the SGN group compared with the MSP group (8.3%; 9/108; p = 0.072). The SGN group also showed a lower incidence of severe general complications (p < 0.05) and a trend towards a lower incidence of wound infections (p = 0.05). There were no differences between the groups regarding the outcome of ADL, hip function or the HRQOL. The reduction in the HRQOL (EQ-5D(index) score) was significant in both groups compared with that before the fracture (p < 0.005). Our findings indicate that the SGN showed good results in both trochanteric and subtrochanteric fractures. The limited number of intra-operative femoral fractures did not influence the outcome or the need for revision surgery. Moreover, the SGN group had a reduced number of serious general complications and wound infections compared with the MSP group. The MSP in the biaxial dynamisation mode had a low rate of failure in trochanteric fractures but an unacceptably high rate when used in the biaxial dynamisation mode in subtrochanteric fractures. The negative influence of an unstable trochanteric or subtrochanteric fracture on the quality of life was significant regardless of the surgical method.<doc-sep>[Osteosynthesis of per- and subtrochanteric fractures by blade plate versus gamma nail.

In the CEA group, 15 ml of 0.375% bupivacaine and 150 micrograms fentanyl were injected into the epidural space at C7-D1 level. In the GA group, patients were anaesthetized with 0.2 mg.kg-1 flunitrazepam and 5 micrograms.kg-1 fentanyl; intubation was carried out using 0.08 mg.kg-1 vecuronium, and the patients were ventilated with a mixture of nitrous oxide and oxygen (50% of each). Further injections, every 30 min, of 2 micrograms.kg-1 fentanyl were given to the patients in group GA. Blood pressure was monitored continuously, up to 4 h postoperatively, with a radial arterial catheter. Per- or postoperative hypertension was defined as a rise in systolic arterial blood pressure (Pasys) over 180 mmHg for greater than 3 min; this was treated with 20 mg nifedipine intranasally (group CEA) or 100 micrograms fentanyl with 0.5 mg flunitrazepam with or without nifedipine (group GA). Per- or postoperative hypotension was defined as a fall in Pasys below 100 mmHg and or a 30% fall in mean arterial blood pressure for greater than 3 min; this was treated, in both groups, with an intravenous bolus of 3 mg ephedrine. Patients in group CEA experienced more frequent episodes of peroperative hypertension (8/2; p less than 0.02) and postoperative hypotension (5/1) than group GA.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)<doc-sep>Local versus general anaesthesia in carotid surgery. A prospective, randomised study.<doc-sep>A randomised, prospective study was performed to compare local (LA) and general anaesthesia (GA) in carotid surgery with special emphasis on complications and the need for intra-operative shunting. Fifty-six patients were randomised to LA and 55 to GA. Eight patients in the LA group required a GA for various reasons. During the same period 14 patients were not randomised. Seven perioperative neurological deficits occurred (5.6%), four in the LA group, two in the GA group, and one in the non-randomised group (NS). Selective shunting was used, in the Ga group according to stump pressure or in cases with a previous stroke and in the LA group according to the appearance of neurological symptoms. In the GA group 25 patients were shunted and in the LA group five patients (P less than 0.001) needed a shunt. If strict pressure criteria for shunting had been used in the LA patients, ten would have been shunted and three of the patients who developed symptoms during clamping would not have been shunted. During surgery the highest recorded systolic pressure was significantly higher in the LA group (210 mmHg versus 173 mmHg, P less than 0.001). LA for carotid endarterectomy is comparable with general anaesthesia regarding peroperative complications but produces significantly higher blood pressures than general anaesthesia. On the other hand it allows the possibility of neurologic monitoring of the patient and leads to significantly less use of an intra-operative shunt.<doc-sep>Hemodynamic status following regional and general anesthesia for carotid endarterectomy.<doc-sep>We prospectively studied 23 patients undergoing carotid endarterectomy under regional (n = 13) or general (n = 10) anesthesia to determine the hemodynamic basis of increased frequency in the need for postoperative vasopressor support when regional anesthesia was used. Anesthesia and postoperative care were conducted without reference to hemodynamic data from pulmonary artery catheterization. Although mean arterial pressure was similar in the two groups postoperatively, 11 of the 13 patients undergoing regional anesthesia and 3 of the 10 patients undergoing general anesthesia required phenylephrine postoperatively. No patient required therapy postoperatively to reduce a systolic pressure exceeding 160 mm Hg. Mean arterial pressure remained below the preoperative baseline value in both groups (p < 0.05 with general anesthesia; p = 0.06 with regional anesthesia) during follow-up. In the general anesthesia group, systemic vascular resistance declined significantly below baseline (p < 0.05) following the operation, accompanied by a decline in mean arterial pressure (p < 0.05) and a higher cardiac output. Intraoperative fluid requirements were greater during general anesthesia than during regional anesthesia (p < 0.01). Pulmonary artery occlusion pressure was lower postoperatively than at baseline in both groups (p < 0.05). Pulmonary artery occlusion pressure was higher in the general anesthesia group despite the greater use of phenylephrine in the regional anesthesia group.<doc-sep>General anaesthesia versus local anaesthesia for carotid surgery (GALA): a multicentre, randomised controlled trial.<doc-sep>The effect of carotid endarterectomy in lowering the risk of stroke ipsilateral to severe atherosclerotic carotid-artery stenosis is offset by complications during or soon after surgery.

Participants were randomly assigned to surgery under general (n=1753) or local (n=1773) anaesthesia between June, 1999 and October, 2007.

Mean middle cerebral artery velocity (MCAV(mean)) was monitored using Transcranial Doppler (TCD) and mean arterial pressure (MAP) assessed by continuous intra-arterial blood pressure transducer.\n                pre-op MCAV(mean) and MAP were similar in both groups. Pre-clamp MCAV(mean) was similar in both groups and did not differ from pre-op values. With carotid clamping the MCAV(mean) significantly dropped in both groups. The post-clamp MCAV(mean) was significantly less in the GA group (p < 0.05), and the percentage reduction in MCAV(mean) significantly more for GA procedures (p < 0.05). Pre-clamp MAP was significantly elevated in LA procedures and significantly lowered in GA procedures. Pre-clamp MAP was significant less for GA procedures (p < 0.001). Post clamp MAP did not differ from pre-clamp levels in either group. There was no correlation between MCAV(mean) and MAP. Complication rate, combined death/stroke rates were similar in each group.\n                LA CEA is associated with better preservation of the ipsilateral cerebral circulation and increased tolerance of the effects of carotid clamping.

The CEA-EQ consists of 15 pre-op and 13 postoperative questions. Validity was established by correlation with the FRS Patient Satisfaction with Surgical Services (SSSQ) and State form of the State Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI-S) in 69 patients (35 LA, 34 GA). Subsequently 88 patients randomised to GA CEA and 88 to LA CEA received the CEA-EQ. A local anaesthetic intraoperative experience questionnaire (LA-EQ) was also developed and given to LA patients only.\n                Validity was confirmed through significant correlations with the STAI-S (r=0.67, p<0.001) and the SSSQ (r=0.44, p<0.001). In the randomised prospective study response rates were greater than 90%. Overall experience and satisfaction with CEA was high. There was no statistically significant difference in anxiety, satisfaction or overall experience between anaesthetic techniques. LA CEA was associated with a significantly better perception of recovery. The majority of LA patients found the procedure acceptable.\n                The CEA-EQ is a valid tool to assess qualitative aspects of CEA patient care. Overall satisfaction and experience with CEA is good and not related to anaesthetic technique. LA CEA is not associated with any increased anxiety, is tolerated by the majority of patients and is associated with a better perception of recovery.<doc-sep>[Comparison of the influence of general and regional anesthesia on basic haemodynamic parameters during carotid endarterectomy].<doc-sep>Carotid endarterectomy (CEA) is a preventive operation to reduce the incidence of embolic and thrombotic cerebral stroke. CEA carries a significant perioeperartive mortality rate from stroke and myocardial infarction, which may even approach 5%. Thus, anesthetic and surgical techniques are constantly under scrutiny to try to reduce this relatively high incidence of morbidity and mortality. Anesthetic technique for CEA is divided to general (GA) and regional (RA) anesthesia, performed by cervical plexus block. The aim this study was to examine changes of basic haemodynamic parameters, which routinely fallows during CEA in condition of GA and RA. After obtaining institutional approval and informed consent, we randomized 50 patients scheduled for CEA (Tab. 1) in two groups (GA and RA). We fallow blood pressure: systolic (BPs), mean (BPm), diastolic (BPd), heart rate (HR), and RPP index at the examined patients. The examination performed in six control times: before induction of anesthesia (T1), 10 minutes after beginning of operation (T2), 5 minutes after cross clamping of arteria carotis (T3), 5 minutes after declamping arteria carotis (T4), 10 minutes (T5) and 2 hours after operation (T6). The results of study shows significant changes of blood pressure (BPs and BPm) and RPP index in T2 time in patinets undergoing GA. The changes occurred under influence of induction agent thiopental. These changes were in homeostatic range. In RA patinets, no haemodynamic changes registrated in control times. Therefore, from haemodynamic aspect RA was superior to GA.<doc-sep>Locoregional versus general anesthesia in carotid surgery: is there an impact on perioperative myocardial ischemia? Results of a prospective monocentric randomized trial.<doc-sep>The incidence of cardiac morbidity and mortality in patients who undergo carotid surgery ranges from 0.7% to 7.1%, but it still represents almost 50% of all perioperative complications. Because no data are available in literature about the impact of the anesthetic technique on such complications, a prospective randomized monocentric study was undertaken to evaluate the role of local anesthesia (LA) and general anesthesia (GA) on cardiac outcome.\n                From November 1995 to February 1998, 107 patients were classified by the cardiologist as cardiac patients (IHD; history of myocardial infarction, previous myocardial revascularization procedures, or myocardial ischemia documented by means of positive electrocardiogram [ECG] stress test results) or noncardiac patients (NIHD; no history of chest pain or negative results for an ECG stress test). The patients were operated on after the randomization for the type of anesthesia (general or local). Continuous computerized 12-lead ECG was performed during the operative procedure and 24 hours postoperatively. The end points of the study were ECG modifications (upsloping or downsloping more than 2 mm) of the sinus tachycardia (ST) segment.\n                Fifty-five patients were classified as IHD, and 52 were classified as NIHD. Twenty-seven of the 55 IHD patients (49%) and 24 of 52 NIHD patients (46%) were operated on under GA. Thirty-six episodes of myocardial ischemia occurred in 22 patients (20.5%). Episodes were slightly more frequent (58%) and longer in the postoperative period (intraoperative, 10 +/- 5 min; postoperative, 60 +/- 45 min; P <. 001). As expected, the prevalence of myocardial ischemia was higher in the group of cardiac patients than in noncardiac group (15 of 55 patients [27%] vs 7 of 52 patients [13%]; P <.02). By comparing the two anesthetic techniques in the overall population, we found a similar prevalence of patients who had myocardial ischemia (GA, 12 of 52 [23%]; LA, 10 of 55 [18%]; P = not significant) and a similar number of ischemic episodes per patient (GA, 1.5 +/- 0.4; LA, 1.8 +/- 0.6; P = not significant). Episodes of myocardial ischemia were similarly distributed in intraoperative and postoperative periods in both groups. It is relevant that under GA, IHD patients represent most of the population who suffered myocardial ischemia (83%). On the contrary, in the group of patients operated on under LA, the prevalence was equally distributed in the two subpopulations.\n                The results confirm the different hemodynamic impact of the two anesthetic techniques. Patients who received LA had a rate of myocardial ischemia that was half that of patients who had GA. The small number of cardiac complications do not permit us to make any definitive conclusion on the impact of the two anesthetic techniques on early cardiac morbidity, but the relationship between perioperative ischemic burden and major cardiac events suggests that LA can be used safely, even in high-risk patients undergoing carotid endarterectomy.<doc-sep>General versus locoregional anesthesia in carotid surgery: a prospective randomised trial.<doc-sep>To evaluate the influence of anesthetic technique on perioperative neurological and cardiopulmonary complication rates in patients undergoing carotid endarterectomy.\n                186 patients with symptomatic internal carotid artery (ICA) stenosis > 70% or asymptomatic ICA stenosis > 80% were prospectively randomized for either locoregional (LA) or general anesthesia (GA).\n                Neurological complication rates were similar in both groups (GA 2% vs. LA 2%). Cardiopulmonary complication rates were not significantly different (GA 4% vs LA 1%). There were no stroke-related deaths, but one patient from the GA group died from severe postoperative pneumonia. Thus, a significant difference in combined stroke/cardiopulmonary related death between the two groups (GA 1% vs LA 0%) could not be found. However, perioperative cardiopulmonary monitoring showed that significantly more patients operated under general anesthesia had hypertensive events, with systolic blood pressure values greater than 180 mmHg on postoperative day one. There were no differences in the number of postoperatively hypotensive episodes (systolic blood pressure values < 100 mmHg) between the two groups.\n                Significant differences in the perioperative neurological and cardiopulmonary complication rates between general and locoregional anesthesia in patients undergoing carotid endarterectomy could not be observed.<doc-sep>",

It is known that high dose carnitine activates surfactant synthesis. Given to women with imminent premature delivery, its benefit on the post natal period is proved. Own studies showed an increased need of carnitine during pregnancy. Therefore the questions rose if carnitine substitution improves placental insufficiency. 15 pregnant women were treated with 2 x 1 g carnitine orally for one week and with 1 x 1 g carnitine during the following 7 days when their fetus showed a retardation of 1-3 weeks. The control group were 15 untreated patients with the same problems of retardation. The placental insufficiency was diagnosed by fetometry, by blood parameters and the doppler ultrasound flow measurement. In the group of the treated patients 11 out of 15 showed an improvement, in 4 patients no effect of carnitine was seen and in 1 patient the retardation increased. In the control group 8 out of 15 patients showed a spontaneous improvement of fetal growth, 2 women did not have a change in their retardation and 5 patients had to be hospitalized because of increasing placental insufficiency. Inspite of the small number of patients a tendency towards a profit in carnitine treatment for placental insufficiency seems to be real.<doc-sep>[Therapy of suspected intrauterine fetal retardation].<doc-sep>In a randomized prospective study, performed on 45 pregnancies with clinical and sonographic suspicion for intrauterine fetal growth retardation, examinations were done to evaluate the therapeutic effect of bed rest and of additional daily administered glucose infusions or oral galactose applications respectively on the fetal growth, the hemodynamic, respiratory and endocrine insufficiency of the materno-feto-placental unit as well as selected biochemical parameters of the umbilical blood. There is no positive therapeutic effect, either on the impaired endocrine partial function nor on the reduced respiratory function of the feto-placental unit. It is obvious, that despite the improvement of the nutritional supply of the fetus and the revival of the regular fetal growth, the previous lack of fetal growth can not be altered. This can be demonstrated in all three therapeutic groups due to the fact of a resulting high hypotrophy-rate of the newborns. The results prove that the additional supply of the fetus with glucose or galactose does not remarkably improve the therapeutic effectivity as opposed by strict bed rest alone.<doc-sep>[Maternal blood and amniotic fluid insulin-like growth factor detection and amniotic cavity drug delivery for early diagnosis and management of fetal growth restriction].<doc-sep>To explore the relationship between insulin-like growth factors (IGFs) and fetal growth restriction (FGR) and early treatment of FGR.\n                The levels of IGF-I and IGF-II were detected with radioimmunoassay in maternal blood and amniotic fluid samples of 44 pregnant women with FGR and 36 normal gravidas. The 44 gravidas with FGR were randomized into treatment group with amino acid by a pediatric administration to the amniotic cavity formula and control group with intravenous infusion of compound amino acid. The therapeutic effects were compared between the two groups on the basis of B-type ultrasound findings.\n                Maternal blood IGF-I and amniotic fluid IGF-I and IGF-II levels in the pregnant women with FGR were significantly lower than those in normal gravidas (P<0.01). After therapy, IGF-I and IGF-II levels were significantly increased in the treatment group (P<0.01), but no obvious changes in IGF-I and IGF-II levels were observed in the control group (P>0.05). Compared with the control group, IGF-I and IGF-II levels increased significantly in the amniotic fluid in the treatment group, with also marked elevation of IGF-I levels in maternal blood (P<0.01). Better therapeutic effects were achieved in the treatment group than in the control group (P<0.01), and the birth weights of the neonates in the treatment group were basically normal.\n                Detection of amniotic fluid IGF-I and IGF-II and maternal blood IGF-I can help predict the condition and facilitate early diagnosis of FGR. Injection of pediatric amino acid into the amniotic cavity can be effective for treatment of FGR.<doc-sep>",

The treatment group received 10 mg/kg (maximum, 1000 mg) PB intravenously, followed by 100 mg orally daily, until delivery. Neonates did not receive PB after birth. Head sonograms were performed on days 3, 7, and 14 and at discharge. Hemorrhage was classified as mild, moderate, or severe by a single reader.\n                Incidence of neonatal ICH in all infants, infants weighing less than 1250 g, and infants of multiple gestations.\n                The study population comprised 110 women, 60 in the control group and 50 in the PB group. Neonates in the control group (n = 74, including 10 pairs of twins and 2 sets of triplets) were comparable to those in the treatment group (n = 62, including 7 pairs of twins, 1 set of triplets, and 1 set of quadruplets) regarding birth weight, gestational age, and other clinical risk factors for ICH. There was a trend for the incidence of any grade of hemorrhage to be lower in the PB group (22% [14 of 62]) compared with the control group (35% [26 of 74]). Moderate and severe hemorrhages were significantly lower in the PB group (1.6% [1 of 62]) compared with the control group (9.4% [7 of 74]). Among infants weighing less than 1250 g, overall ICH was lower in the PB group (23% [6 of 26]) compared with the control group (51% [18 of 35]). Among multiple-gestation infants, overall ICH was 4.7% (1 of 21) in the PB group, compared with 31% (8 of 26) in the control group.\n                Antenatal PB therapy results in a significant decrease in moderate and severe ICH in infants born at less than 35 weeks' gestation. Antenatal PB therapy also resulted in a decrease in the incidence of all grades of ICH in infants weighing less than 1250 g and infants born of multiple gestations.<doc-sep>Antenatal phenobarbital for the prevention of periventricular and intraventricular hemorrhage: a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, multihospital trial.<doc-sep>To determine whether the neuroprotective properties of phenobarbital would alter the incidence and severity of intracranial hemorrhage in premature infants, we randomly assigned 110 women at less than 31 weeks of gestation to receive 10 mg/kg phenobarbital or placebo in a blinded fashion before delivery. Infants were examined postnatally with real-time ultrasonography for evidence of intracranial hemorrhage. Maternal demographics, pregnancy complications, antenatal management, and route of delivery did not differ between the phenobarbital group (n = 50) and the placebo group (n = 60). The total incidence of periventricular-intraventricular hemorrhage did not differ between the phenobarbital-treated (n = 54) and the placebo-treated (n = 67) infants. However, the frequency of grade 3 and grade 4 hemorrhages was 15% (10 infants) in the placebo group and 3.7% (2 infants) in the phenobarbital group (p less than 0.05). There were no differences in the severity of associated conditions in the babies to explain the difference in the incidence of severe hemorrhage between the study groups. We conclude that antenatal administration of phenobarbital appears to be effective in decreasing the severity of periventricular-intraventricular hemorrhage in infants delivered at less than 31 weeks of gestation.<doc-sep>Use of prenatal phenobarbital in the prevention of subependymal/intraventricular hemorrhage in premature infants.<doc-sep>Subependymal/intraventricular hemorrhage (SE/IVH) is a frequent cause of disability and mortality.\n                This is a prospective, randomized, double-blind study which included 100 pregnant Mexican women who need to interrupt their pregnancy within 28-32 weeks of gestation. One group was given a single dose of intravenous (IV) phenobarbital 10 micrograms/kg (phenobarbital group, n = 50), and the other was provided with diluted distilled water (control group). Measurements of phenobarbital serum concentrations were taken by both mother and newborn, and head sonograms were applied during the first 24 hours, at the 3rd and 7th days of life.\n                The sample was made up of 42 newborns in the phenobarbital group, and 46 in the control group; the newborns had phenobarbital levels of 11.5 5.7 g/microliter at birth, and of 9.5 +/- 5.9 g/microliter 24 hours later. SE/IVH was found in 12 patients from the phenobarbital group and in 29 from the control group (p < 0.005), the first group were 11 mild SE/IVH (2 grade I, and 9 grade II), and 26 in the control group (4 grade I, and 22 grade II), p < 0.005. Severe hemorrhages were similar between groups. A larger frequency of SE/IVH was found in the newborn group which received mechanical ventilation (p = 0.0008).\n                Prenatal phenobarbital can reduce the SE/IVH frequency in premature infants younger than 32 weeks at birth.

The second group received no antenatal treatment, but the infants were treated with phenobarbital after birth for at least four days. The infants were followed with ultrasound examinations of the head on postnatal days 1, 4, and 10 to assess the grade and progression of intraventricular hemorrhage. Intraventricular hemorrhage was significantly less frequent in the experimental group, 16 of 75 (21%) versus 35 of 75 (47%), P less than .01. Similarly, the experimental group had significantly fewer cases of severe intraventricular hemorrhage (grades III and IV), four of 75 (5%) versus 15 of 75 (20%), P less than .05 and mortality three of 75 (4%) versus ten of 75 (13%), P less than .05.

This report reviews our experience with maternal phenobarbital therapy and fetal bilirubin conjugation in the very premature fetus. Mothers with arrested premature labor between 26 and 33 weeks' gestation were randomly assigned to receive oral phenobarbital (90 mg daily) or not. Infants in the two groups were similar in race, birth weight, and gestational age. Conjugated bilirubin levels at birth were significantly higher for infants receiving several days of phenobarbital in utero than no therapy (0.31 +/- 0.03 vs 0.16 +/- 0.01 mg dl, p less than 0.01). A smaller portion of infants exposed to phenobarbital in utero required phototherapy (10/23, 43% vs 24/29, 83%, p less than 0.01), which was also more likely to be delayed beyond 48 hours after delivery.

All patients received betamethasone and antibiotics and were managed uniformly by a single perinatal group in one hospital. All newborns were managed uniformly in the same facility by a single neonatal group.\n                There was a nonsignificant reduction in all grades of intraventricular hemorrhage in the treatment group when compared to the placebo group (48.2 versus 38.3%; P > .05). Frequencies were reduced for severe intraventricular hemorrhage (grades 3 and 4) (6.0 versus 2.5%; P > .05) and mild intraventricular hemorrhage (grades 1 and 2) (42.2 versus 35.8%; P > .05).\n                Antepartum phenobarbital and vitamin K effected a nonsignificant reduction in both mild and severe intraventricular hemorrhage.

The time interval between the dose of phenobarbital and delivery was 5.5 +/- 4.8 hours (mean +/- SD). The infants in the control group (n = 23) and those in the phenobarbital-treated group (n = 25) were comparable regarding birth weight, gestational age, and other obstetric and neonatal risk factors associated with intracerebral hemorrhage. The incidence of intracerebral hemorrhage was 56.5% (13 of 23 infants) in the control group and 32% (eight of 25 infants) in the phenobarbital-treated group (p = 0.08). Moderate or severe hemorrhage was diagnosed in six of 13 control infants and in none of the phenobarbital-treated infants (p less than 0.01). The mortality rate was significantly lower in the phenobarbital-treated group (two of 25 infants) than in the control group (eight of 23 infants; p less than 0.05).

Four hundred and twenty-six male and 42 female clients were randomly assigned to an intervention group (I), and 413 males and 76 females were assigned to a control (C) group. The I group was given an approximately 2-minute smoking cessation instruction by physicians, answered a quiz concerning tobacco, chose their own behavioral goals and were handed a leaflet on how to quit smoking. Subjects in both groups responded to a self-administered questionnaire and a 6-month and 12-month follow-up was performed by post card or telephone. The I group received an encouragement card one month after instruction and abstainers of the I group were awarded a telephone card at the 6-month follow-up. The results were as follows: 1) The male I group exhibited 7.3% (6 months), 10.1% (12 months) abstinence rates and the male C group 4.4% (6 months), 5.3% (12 months), respectively. The difference in 12-month abstinence rates was statistically significant. 2) The female I group exhibited abstinence rates of 16.7% (6 months), 23.8% (12 months) and the female C group 14.5% (6 months), 17.1% (12 months), respectively. 3) A multivariate analysis of smoking cessation showed that lower nicotine dependency, strong determination for smoking cessation, and being female were significant factors for abstinence at the 6-month follow-up. At 12 months, the smoking cessation instruction also became a significant factor.

The present study tested three hypotheses: (a) providing 3 to 5 min of behavioral counseling regarding a cessation strategy would be more effective than simply warning the smoker to quit smoking; (b) smokers with abnormal pulmonary function would be more likely to comply with medical advice than would smokers with normal pulmonary function; and (c) that smokers with abnormal pulmonary function who receive behavioral counseling would be the group most likely to achieve prolonged abstinence. Asbestos-exposed smoking men undergoing screening in a mandated program for naval shipyard workers were categorized as having normal or abnormal pulmonary status on the basis of chest X ray and pulmonary function tests (PFT). They were then randomly assigned within PFT categories to receive either a simple warning or 3 to 5 min of behavioral cessation counseling from the physician who gave them the results of their pulmonary tests. Subjects' smoking status was evaluated at 3- and 11-month intervals following the physician intervention. Smokers who received behavioral counseling were more likely to quit and remain abstinent over the 11-month period (8.4% abstinent) than were smokers given a minimal warning (3.6% abstinent). Prolonged abstinence rates among abnormal PFT subjects (3.7%) did not differ from those of normals (5.9%). The group with normal PFT who received behavioral counseling achieved the highest level of abstinence (9.5%).

Measurement of breath carbon monoxide (CO) and urinary cotinine, a metabolite of nicotine, were used as objective markers of smoking. All patients wished to cease smoking and the impact of health counselling was reviewed in a 'Stop Smoking' clinic. In addition to routine advice on the health hazards of smoking, half the patients and their families also received further counselling during a home visit by a health visitor. After 6 months many of the 60 patients claimed to have reduced their cigarette consumption. However, the urinary cotinine concentrations did not confirm this. Only one patient actually stopped smoking and he had sustained a myocardial infarction during the study. There was a small but significant reduction of breath CO in the patients seen at home by the health visitor but the urinary cotinine concentrations were unchanged. This suggests that these patients abstained from smoking for only a few hours before attending the 'Stop Smoking' clinic.<doc-sep>Nicotine chewing gum in general practice: effect of follow up appointments.<doc-sep>Two hundred smokers who were judged by their general practitioner to be motivated to stop smoking were allocated to one of two groups.

At one year follow up 15.5% overall had stopped smoking, 14% in the low and 17% in the high contact group. This is better than most results so far reported for nicotine chewing gum in general practice, suggesting that general practitioners can use it to good effect.

The unit of randomisation was the work site physician and a random sample of the employees of whom he or she was in charge. The length of the follow up was one year.

Twenty three subjects (4.6%) in group A and 36 (6.1%) in group B (p=0.26) declared abstinence of six months or more. Among non-smokers at baseline, 3.4% in both groups were smokers after one year follow up. The prevalence of smokers did not differ significantly at baseline (32.9% and 32.4%, p=0.75). After the intervention the prevalence of smoking was 30.8% in group A and 28. 7% in group B (p=0.19). An increase of the mean symptoms score for depression in those who quit was observed during this period.\n                A simple cessation intervention strategy during a mandatory annual examination, targeting a population of smokers independently of their motivation to stop smoking or their health status, showed a 36% relative increase of the proportion of smokers who quit smoking as compared with what can be achieved through simple advice.<doc-sep>A randomised controlled trial of the effect on middle-aged men of advice to stop smoking.<doc-sep>A randomised controlled trial of smoking cessation is reported in 1445 male smokers aged 40-59 at high risk of cardiorespiratory disease. The 714 men in the intervention group were recalled for a series of personal interviews with a doctor. After one year, 51% of the intervention group reported that they were not smoking any cigarettes, and most of the others reported a reduction. Compared with the \"normal care\" group, the men in the intervention group showed a decline in the prevalence of sputum production and dyspnoea; ventilatory function did not improve but its rate of decline was significantly slowed. There were no evident effects on blood pressure levels, nor on electrocardiographic findings over three years, nor on sickness absence over one year. Mortality follow-up has continued for an average of 7.9 years; 98 (13.7%) of the intervention group have died, compared with 94 (12.9%) of the \"normal care\" group. The 95% confidence limits on mortality range from 2.63% in favour of intervention to 4.37% in favour of normal care. The power of the trial has been reduced by smoking cessation in the \"normal care\" group. It is concluded that smoking cessation in these middle-aged men improved the symptoms and progress of chronic bronchitis; but the reversibility of the risk of cigarettes to the smoker's life may have been overestimated in observational studies.<doc-sep>\"Sick of Smoking\": evaluation of a targeted minimal smoking cessation intervention in general practice.<doc-sep>Several smoking intervention studies have been conducted overseas which use a minimal amount of general practitioners' time and are conducted within the constraints of a normal consultation. However, there are no published reports of minimal interventions in Australian general practice. This study reports on 1238 South Australian smokers who were assigned to a non-intervention control group or a group which received firm general practitioner advice to quit smoking plus literature. At one-year follow-up, 7.5% of smokers in the minimal advice group who had quit for six or more months remained non-smokers compared with 3.2% in the control group. If similar analytical procedures had been used in this study as were used in the benchmark study in England in 1979, the quit rate for this study would have been 11.3% in the intervention group, and 4.8% in the control group--a net gain of 6.5%. These results are discussed with regard to widespread implementation in Australian general practice.<doc-sep>Smoking cessation in family practice: the effects of advice and nicotine chewing gum prescription.<doc-sep>The efficacy of physician anti-smoking intervention with 289 patients in a family practice setting was assessed. The design included two treatment conditions, physician advice and physician advice plus the offer of nicotine chewing gum (NCG) prescription. A no-advice group permitted assessment of the effects of repeated testing. The NCG group had higher rates of abstinence at all follow-up points, but the difference approached statistical significance at 3 months only (p less than .10). Comparison of those who actually used NCG to all other groups revealed significantly more users were abstinent at 1- and 3-month follow-up. A similar pattern occurred for proportion attempting cessation and smoking reduction. A dose-response relationship of gum use to outcome was identified. Long-term users (greater than 20 days) had 86% abstinence at 3 months versus 18% for short-term users. Thus, NCG does appear to have a role in family practice for promoting short-term cessation.<doc-sep>Evaluation of a minimal-contact smoking cessation intervention in an outpatient setting.<doc-sep>We examined the ability of a provider-initiated, minimal-contact intervention to modify the smoking behavior of ambulatory clinic patients. Smokers at two outpatient sites were assigned to one of three groups: provider intervention only (PI); provider intervention plus self-help manual (PI/M); and usual care (control) group (C). The physician message emphasized the patient's personal susceptibility, the physician's concern, and the patient's ability to quit (self-efficacy). The nurse consultation concentrated on benefits and barriers associated with stopping, and on strategies for cessation. Telephone interviews were conducted with the 250 participants within a few days of their clinic visit and again at one and six months. Both PI and PI/M proved to be superior to usual care in motivating attempts to quit at both one-month and six-month follow-ups, and logistic regression analyses indicated that participants receiving the self-help manual in addition to the health provider message were between two and three times more likely to quit smoking during the study period than were participants in either of the other study groups.<doc-sep>Proactive interventions for smoking cessation in general medical practice: a quasi-randomized controlled trial to examine the efficacy of computer-tailored letters and physician-delivered brief advice.<doc-sep>To test the efficacy of (i) computer-generated tailored letters and (ii) practitioner-delivered brief advice for smoking cessation against an assessment-only condition; and to compare both interventions directly.\n                Quasi-randomized controlled trial.\n                A total of 34 randomly selected general practices from a German region (participation rate 87%).\n                A total of 1499 consecutive patients aged 18-70 years with daily cigarette smoking (participation rate 80%).\n                The tailored letters intervention group received up to three individualized personal letters. Brief advice was delivered during routine consultation by the practitioner after an onsite training session. Both interventions were based on the Transtheoretical Model of behaviour change.\n                Self-reported point prevalence and prolonged abstinence at 6-, 12-, 18- and 24-month follow-ups.\n                Among participants completing the last follow-up, 6-month prolonged abstinence was 18.3% in the tailored letters intervention group, 14.8% in the brief advice intervention group and 10.5% in the assessment-only control group. Assuming those lost to follow-up to be smokers, the rates were 10.2%, 9.7% and 6.7%, respectively. Analyses including all follow-ups confirmed statistically significant effects of both interventions compared to assessment only. Using complete case analysis, the tailored letters intervention was significantly more effective than brief advice for 24-hour [odds ratio (OR) = 1.4; P = 0.047] but not for 7-day point prevalence abstinence (OR = 1.4; P = 0.068) for prolonged abstinence, or for alternative assumptions about participants lost to follow-up.\n                The study demonstrated long-term efficacy of low-cost interventions for smoking cessation in general practice. The interventions are suitable to reach entire populations of general practices and smoking patients. Computer-generated letters are a promising option to overcome barriers to provide smoking cessation counselling routinely.<doc-sep>Smoking cessation in patients: two further studies by the British Thoracic Society. Research Committee of the British Thoracic Society.<doc-sep>The effects of various smoking cessation strategies were studied in two multicentre trials with new patients attending hospital or a chest clinic because of a smoking related disease. In the first trial (study A, 1462 patients) the effect of the physician's usual advice to stop smoking was compared with the effect of the same advice reinforced by a signed agreement to stop smoking by a target date within the next week, two visits by a health visitor in the first six weeks, and a series of letters of encouragement from the physician. The second trial (study B, 1392 patients) compared (1) advice only, (2) advice supplemented by a signed agreement, (3) advice supplemented by a series of letters of encouragement, and (4) advice supplemented by a signed agreement and a series of letters of encouragement. Patients were reviewed at six months and those claiming to have stopped smoking were seen again at 12 months. Claims of abstinence were checked by carboxyhaemoglobin measurement. In study A 9% of the intervention group had succeeded in stopping smoking at six months compared with 7% of the \"advice only\" patients (p = 0.17). In study B success rates were 5.2%, 4.9%, 8.5%, and 8.8% respectively. The signed agreement did not influence outcome, whereas postal encouragement increased the effect of the physician's advice. In both studies patients reviewed clinically between the initial and the six month visit were more likely to stop smoking than those not reviewed. Success rates increased with age and men tended to do better than women. The studies suggest that physician's advice alone will persuade 5% of outpatients with a smoking related disease to stop smoking. Subsequent postal encouragement will increase the cessation rate by more than half as much again. Such small improvements in success rates are worth while, especially if they can be achieved cheaply and on a wide scale.<doc-sep>Brief physician-initiated quit-smoking strategies for clinical oncology settings: a trial coordinated by the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group.<doc-sep>Although tobacco use by cancer patients increases the risk of relapse, diminishes treatment efficacy, and worsens quality of life, about one third of patients who smoked before their diagnosis continue to smoke. Because patients have regular contact with oncologists, the efficacy of a physician-based smoking cessation treatment was evaluated.\n                Cancer patients (n = 432) were randomly assigned to either usual care or a National Institutes of Health (NIH) physician-based smoking intervention. The primary outcome was 7-day point prevalence abstinence at 6 and 12 months after study entry.\n                At the 6-month follow-up, there was no significant difference in quit rates between the usual care (11.9%) and intervention (14.4%) groups, and there was no significant difference between the usual care (13.6%) and intervention (13.3%) groups at the 12-month follow-up. Patients were more likely to have quit smoking at 6 months if they had head and neck or lung cancer, began smoking after the age of 16, reported at baseline using a cessation self-help guide or treatment in the last 6 months, and showed greater baseline desire to quit. Patients were more likely to have quit smoking at 12 months if they smoked 15 or fewer cigarettes per day, had head and neck or lung cancer, tried a group cessation program, and showed greater baseline desire to quit. Finally, there was greater adherence among physicians to the NIH model for physician smoking treatment for patients in the intervention versus the usual care group.\n                While training physicians to provide smoking cessation treatment to cancer patients can enhance physician adherence to clinical practice guidelines, physician smoking cessation interventions fail to yield significant gains in long-term quit rates among cancer patients.<doc-sep>Three year evaluation of a programme by general practitioners to help patients to stop smoking.<doc-sep>A controlled study was undertaken to measure the effectiveness of general practitioners' use of an intensive programme to help patients to stop smoking. Two hundred cigarette smokers who attended a general practice were allocated to either a treatment (n = 100) or a non-intervention control (n = 100) group. After the initial visit treatment consisted of an educational consultation and four follow up visits. Smoking state was assessed biochemically at six months and three years. Thirty five patients in the treatment group were abstinent at three years compared with eight in the control group (p less than 0.001). Sixty four patients attended the educational consultation and first follow up visit; of these, 45 were not smoking at the first follow up visit, 30 maintained abstinence up to six months, and 22 were still not smoking after three years. Among the 37 patients who completed the treatment programme and attended all the follow up visits 57% were abstinent at three years. The results of this study suggest that general practitioners can help patients to stop smoking.<doc-sep>A randomized trial of smoking cessation interventions in general practice in Italy.<doc-sep>The purpose of this study was to examine the effectiveness of different practice-based approaches to assist patients of primary care physicians to quit smoking and sustain cessation. Forty-four nonsmoking general practitioners volunteered for the study. After a period of training, they randomized 923 smoking clients, unselected for motivation toward quitting, to four different intervention groups: (i) minimal intervention, consisting of one single counselling session and a brief handout on quitting techniques; (ii) repeated counselling including reinforcing sessions at Months 1, 3, 6, and 9; (iii) repeated counselling and use of nicotine gum; and (iv) repeated counselling and spirometry. Biochemically validated smoking status was assessed at six and 12 months after recruitment. The proportion of verified quitters at 12 months was 4.8 percent among subjects randomized to the minimal intervention group, compared to 5.5 percent, 7.5 percent, and 6.5 percent among those randomized to the three repeated-counselling groups. In no treatment group was the outcome significantly different from that for one-time counselling at the (P less than 0.05) level. Lack of power, contamination, and low attendance at reinforcing sessions should be taken into account in interpreting the results.<doc-sep>Reaching midlife and older smokers: tailored interventions for routine medical care.<doc-sep>Although older adults can achieve significant health benefits from smoking cessation, few programs have specifically targeted this population. This study tested the effectiveness of an office-based smoking cessation program tailored to midlife and older smokers.\n                This paper describes a randomized controlled trial comparing usual care with physician-delivered brief quit-smoking advice and counseling for midlife and older smokers (ages 50-74). Outpatient medical practices assigned to the Immediate Intervention (experimental) condition were trained to deliver brief quit-smoking advice and counseling. Delayed Intervention (control) practices followed usual care procedures. Thirty-nine practices accruing five or more patients per practice were included in the analyses.\n                Using conservative measure of quitting, self-reported quit rates at 6-month follow-up were 15.41% for the Immediate Intervention group versus 8.16% of subjects in the Delayed Intervention group (P < 0.005). Baseline subject (N = 659) characteristics related to 6-month abstinence included number of previous quit attempts, quitting for 24 hr in the past year, desire to quit, confidence in quitting, perceived health benefits, and lower nicotine dependence.\n                Smoking abstinence was significantly increased by training physicians and key office and clinical staff to intervene with older smokers. Brief interventions are tailored to this age cohort can be successfully and efficaciously integrated into routine care.<doc-sep>Is smoking intervention in general practice more successful among pregnant than non-pregnant women?<doc-sep>The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of a simple smoking intervention programme, carried out by a large number of general practitioners (GPs) among pregnant and non-pregnant women. Four groups of women were defined by the dichotomies pregnant versus non-pregnant and intervention versus control. The intervention was semistructured, using a flip-over and a booklet, and it was implemented in an ordinary sequence of consultations. The study involved 187 GPs in western Norway. The subjects were 350 daily smoking pregnant women and 274 daily smoking non-pregnant women, 18-34 years of age. The point prevalence abstinence rate at 18 months was 15 and 20% for pregnant and non-pregnant women, respectively, in the intervention groups, and 7% in the control groups (Ppregnant = 0.06, Pnon-pregnant = 0.006). Twenty-five per cent of the pregnant women and 34% of the non-pregnant women reported that they had reduced their cigarette consumption, but had not stopped smoking entirely. If we include all drop-outs as smokers, the continuous abstinence rate during 15 months was 6%/0% among pregnant women (intervention/control) and 5%/1% among non-pregnant women. Stopping smoking was associated with having a non-smoking partner (P = 0.001), and being encouraged to do so by their partner (P = 0.004). The prevalence of both pregnant and non-pregnant women who stopped smoking was higher in the intervention than in the control groups. Pregnant women stopped smoking as frequently as non-pregnant individuals.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)<doc-sep>Effects of nicotine chewing gum and follow-up appointments in physician-based smoking cessation.<doc-sep>The effect of different follow-up programs reinforced or not reinforced with the nicotine chewing gum Nicorette was tested by 13 physicians working in the open health care system. A total of 151 patients were advised to stop smoking, and were asked to participate in the program if judged sufficiently motivated by the physicians. After inclusion they were randomized into short or long follow-up, and nicotine gum vs no gum. The physicians conducted the follow-up therapy in their own personal way. Short follow-up was comprised of one appointment 14 days after cessation, while long follow-up consisted of a telephone call (1 week), an appointment (2 weeks), a second appointment (1 month), and a letter (3 months). The results at 12 months were that long follow-up showed a trend (P less than 0.12 toward being better than short follow-up, while nicotine gum was significantly better than no gum (P less than 0.05) in maintaining abstinence. The group with the best outcome was the one receiving long follow-up and nicotine gum, which yielded an expired air carbon monoxide-controlled, 12-month abstinence rate of 27%. The abstinence outcomes at 12 months for the other groups were short follow-up and nicotine gum, 22%; long follow-up and no gum, 15%; and short follow-up and no gum, 3%. The physicians' reactions to the smoking cessation treatment were largely positive. The nicotine gum seems to be a relatively simple, cost-effective, and practical tool for physicians to enhance and reinforce their antismoking advice. With a longer active follow-up period than was used here (1 month), even better results may be possible.<doc-sep>Controlled trial of three different antismoking interventions in general practice.<doc-sep>Of 6052 adult patients who consulted their doctors in six Oxfordshire general practices between October 1980 and February 1981, 2110 (35%) were smokers. The smokers were allocated to one of four study groups--a control (non-intervention) group; a group that received verbal and written antismoking advice from the general practitioner; a group that received this advice and also a demonstration of exhaled carbon monoxide; and a group that received the advice plus the offer of further help from a health visitor. After one year 72% of smokers replied to a postal follow up questionnaire: 11% of the control group claimed to have stopped smoking compared with 15% in the group that received advice alone, 17% in the exhaled carbon monoxide group, and 13% in the health visitor group. Validation of these findings by assays of urinary concentrations of cotinine showed that between 24% and 40% of subjects may have misreported their smoking habits, but there was no indication that the rate of misreporting was higher in the intervention groups than in the control group. Giving advice routinely against smoking has a useful effect, and showing an immediate, personal, and potentially harmful consequence of smoking using a CO-oximeter may improve this, particularly in lower socioeconomic groups.<doc-sep>The impact of physicians' brief smoking cessation counseling: a MIRNET study.<doc-sep>Although many family physicians may discuss smoking cessation with their patients, few do so consistently. A common belief among many physicians is that such efforts will not deter their patients from smoking. Others believe the time commitment required for a successful intervention is excessive. The present study addressed the above issues by examining the effect of a 3- to 5-minute unstructured physician discussion encouraging smoking cessation with family practice patients. Cigarette-smoking patients of two busy family practices in southeast Michigan were randomly assigned to either a control group receiving routine care or an intervention group receiving, in addition to routine care, smoking cessation counseling from their physician. A third comparison group was drawn from smokers in practices not involved in delivering the intervention. Two hundred thirty-eight patients from the intervention group, 178 from the control group, and 47 from the comparison group were followed up with a telephone interview at 6 months. Intervention group patients made significantly more quit attempts than did those in the control group (P less than .001), which was similar to the comparison group. At the 6-month follow-up, 8% of intervention group members, and 4% of both the comparison and control groups reportedly were abstinent from smoking. Among those contacted at the 1-year follow-up, the respective percentages abstinent were 8%, 3%, and 4%. Although these differences in quit rates were not statistically significant, the findings suggest that physicians can positively affect patient smoking cessation. This intervention was feasible in busy family practices, highlighting its generalizability and applicability to other family practice settings in the United States.<doc-sep>Reducing maternal smoking and relapse: long-term evaluation of a pediatric intervention.<doc-sep>Pediatric well-care visits provide a clinical opportunity to counsel new mothers about their smoking and the deleterious effects of environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) on infant health.\n                Forty-nine Oregon pediatric offices enrolled 2,901 women who were currently smoking or had quit for pregnancy, using a brief survey at the newborn's first office visit. Randomly assigned offices provided advice and materials to mothers at each well-care visit during the first 6 months postpartum to promote quitting or relapse prevention.\n                The intervention reduced smoking (5.9% vs 2.7%) and relapse (55% vs 45%) at 6-month follow-up, but logistic regression analysis at 12 months revealed no significant treatment effect. The intervention had a positive effect on secondary outcome variables, such as readiness to quit and attitude toward and knowledge of ETS. Multiple logistic regression analysis indicated that husband/partner smoking was the strongest predictor of maternal quitting or relapse.\n                A pediatric office-based intervention can significantly affect smoking and relapse prevention for mothers of newborns, but the effect decreases with time. Consistent prompting of the provider to give brief advice and materials at well-care visits could provide a low-cost intervention to reduce infant ETS exposure.<doc-sep>A family physician smoking cessation program: an evaluation of the role of follow-up visits.<doc-sep>Our purpose in this randomized clinical trial was to compare a two-visit smoking cessation intervention by family physicians with the same intervention supplemented by additional follow-ups. Forty-one southern Ontario family physicians volunteered for the study and subsequently participated in a four-hour training program on smoking cessation techniques. Physicians advised patients who smoked and indicated an interest in attempting to quit with the help of their physician to stop smoking at the end of a regularly scheduled visit. Physicians instructed patients to make a specific appointment for an evaluation of their smoking habits. Six hundred forty-seven patients returned for that assessment and were than randomized into either the two-visit intervention group (with risk assessment, support, the setting of a cessation date, self-help literature, and a prescription for nicotine gum, where appropriate) or into the other intervention group (with the same maneuvers as well as the offer of four more supportive follow-up visits). We found no statistically significant difference in one-year, biochemically validated, sustained cessation rates between the group offered the long-term follow-up visits (12.5%) and the group given the brief intervention (10.2%). The 95% confidence interval on the difference between the groups was 2.8% in favor of the brief intervention group to 7.3% in favor of the group offered follow-up. The results do not support the value of long-term follow-up visits for smokers.<doc-sep>Facilitating autonomous motivation for smoking cessation.<doc-sep>Physicians used either an autonomy-supportive or a controlling interpersonal style to counsel smokers based on National Cancer Institute guidelines. Physician autonomy support was rated from audiotapes, and patients' perceived competence and autonomous motivation for quitting were self-reported on questionnaires. Validated point prevalences for 6, 12, and 30 months and for continuous cessation were examined. The intervention did not have a direct effect on quit rates; however, structural equation modeling supported the self-determination process model of smoking cessation. The model indicated that the autonomy-supportive intervention was rated as more autonomy supportive, that rated autonomy support predicted autonomous motivation, and that autonomous motivation predicted cessation at all points in time. Perceived competence contributed independent variance to cessation only at 6 months.<doc-sep>Randomized controlled trial of a computer-based, tailored intervention to increase smoking cessation counseling by primary care physicians.<doc-sep>The primary care visit represents an important venue for intervening with a large population of smokers. However, physician adherence to the Smoking Cessation Clinical Guideline (5As) remains low. We evaluated the effectiveness of a computer-tailored intervention designed to increase smoking cessation counseling by primary care physicians.\n                Physicians and their patients were randomized to either intervention or control conditions. In addition to brief smoking cessation training, intervention physicians and patients received a one-page report that characterized the patients' smoking habit and history and offered tailored recommendations. Physician performance of the 5As was assessed via patient exit interviews. Quit rates and smoking behaviors were assessed 6 months postintervention via patient phone interviews. Intervention effects were tested in a sample of 70 physicians and 518 of their patients. Results were analyzed via generalized and mixed linear modeling controlling for clustering.\n                Intervention physicians exceeded controls on \"Assess\" (OR 5.06; 95% CI 3.22, 7.95), \"Advise\" (OR 2.79; 95% CI 1.70, 4.59), \"Assist-set goals\" (OR 4.31; 95% CI 2.59, 7.16), \"Assist-provide written materials\" (OR 5.14; 95% CI 2.60, 10.14), \"Assist-provide referral\" (OR 6.48; 95% CI 3.11, 13.49), \"Assist-discuss medication\" (OR 4.72;95% CI 2.90, 7.68), and \"Arrange\" (OR 8.14; 95% CI 3.98, 16.68), all p values being < 0.0001. Intervention patients were 1.77 (CI 0.94, 3.34,p = 0.078) times more likely than controls to be abstinent (12 versus 8%), a difference that approached, but did not reach statistical significance, and surpassed controls on number of days quit (18.4 versus 12.2, p < .05) but not on number of quit attempts.\n                The use of a brief computer-tailored report improved physicians' implementation of the 5As and had a modest effect on patients' smoking behaviors 6 months postintervention.<doc-sep>The impact of routine advice on smoking cessation from family physicians.<doc-sep>Cigarette smoking continues to be a major health problem. Therefore, physicians have been asked to advise all their patients on the hazards of smoking. A controlled trial was undertaken to measure the impact of family physicians' advice to cigarette smokers during a routine office visit. No significant differences were found in the three measures used to determine outcome--desire to stop smoking, an attempt to stop and success in stopping--between the control and intervention groups. These results are discussed in relation to the health belief model, and suggestions are made on how to increase the impact family physicians could have on smoking cessation to their practices.<doc-sep>Randomized clinical trial of supportive follow-up for cigarette smokers in a family practice.<doc-sep><doc-sep>Smoking prevention among people aged 60 and over: a randomized controlled trial.<doc-sep>This study aimed to test the hypothesis that people aged 60 and older respond to assistance in stopping smoking.

Among the 208 smokers in the intervention group there were more attempts to quit, and they were more successful than in the 216 smokers in the control group. The proportions of quitters after a year was 5.3% and 2.3% in each group (p less than 0.05). Among the variables related to success in quitting are self-reliance, the willingness to reduce or quit smoking, the intensity of the habit and the family environment.<doc-sep>Effect of nicotine chewing gum as an adjunct to general practitioner's advice against smoking.<doc-sep>This study was designed to see whether the offer and prescription of nicotine chewing gum would enhance the efficacy of general practitioners' advice to stop smoking. A sample of 1938 cigarette smokers who attended the surgeries of 34 general practitioners in six group practices were assigned by week of attendance (in a balanced design) to one of three groups: (a) non-intervention controls, (b) advice plus booklet, and (c) advice plus booklet plus the offer of nicotine gum. Follow up was done after four months and one year. The results show a clear advantage for those offered the nicotine gum (p less than 0.001). After correction for those who refused or failed chemical validation and those who switched from cigarettes to a pipe or cigars, the proportions who were abstinent at four months and still abstinent at one year were 3.9%, 4.1%, and 8.8% in the three groups, respectively. These percentages are based on all cigarette smokers who attended the surgeries including those who did not wish to stop and those in the gum group who did not try the gum (47%). The effect of the offer and prescription of gum was to motivate more smokers to try to stop, to increase the success rate among those who tried, and to reduce the relapse rate of those who stopped. The self selected subgroup of 8% who used more than one box of 105 pieces of gum achieved a success rate of 24%. It would be feasible and effective for general practitioners to include the offer of nicotine gum and brief instructions on its use as part of a minimal intervention routine with all cigarette smokers. A general practitioner who adopts such a routine with similar success could expect to achieve about 35-40 long term ex-smokers a year and so save the lives of about 10 of them. If replicated by all general practitioners throughout the country the yield of ex-smokers would be about one million a year.<doc-sep>Smoking cessation in patients with COPD in daily general practice (SMOCC): six months' results.<doc-sep>Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) forms an increasing health problem. Despite smoking cessation improving the prognosis of the disease, many patients persist smoking. The present study presents the results of a smoking cessation counseling protocol in general practice (Smoking Cessation in patients with COPD in general practice (SMOCC)).\n                A randomized controlled trial of patients with COPD compared smoking cessation counseling according to an intensified minimal intervention strategy with usual care. In total 43 general practices with 392 patients participated in Nijmegen, The Netherlands, in 2001-2002.\n                Significantly more smokers in the experimental group made a quit attempt (44.9% versus 36.5%) and actually quit smoking than in the control group (16.0% versus 8.8%). The motivation to stop smoking at baseline was not associated with smoking cessation.\n                The SMOCC strategy doubled the self-reported quit rates and was complied well by the general practitioners. Implementation in general practice is recommended.<doc-sep>Effectiveness of a minimal contact smoking cessation program for Dutch general practitioners: a randomized controlled trial.<doc-sep>Until recently, Dutch general practitioners contributed little to tobacco control. This is due to several factors, among which is the lack of a feasible intervention program for adult smokers. Such a minimal contact behavioral intervention, using the Stage-of-Change concept, is now available. Effectiveness was tested in a randomized trial.\n                Twenty-two general practitioners and their practice assistants were trained in applying the program. In all, 530 smoking patients were enrolled, randomly assigned to either the intervention or the usual treatment condition. Analysis of treatment effects was performed with logistic regression analysis. In a backward stepwise procedure confounding effects of baseline differences were eliminated.\n                At 12-month follow-up, self-reported abstinence rates (including nonrespondents as smokers) differed significantly between intervention subjects and controls: 13.4 vs 7.3% point prevalence (odds ratio 1.51, P < 0.05). An analysis of consecutive abstinence, defined as being abstinent at both 6- and 12-month follow-up, showed that 8.2% of the intervention group compared to 3.1% of the controls had sustained abstinence for more than 6 months (odds ratio 3.04, P < 0.001).\n                Results indicate that an effective smoking cessation program for use in Dutch general practice, already shown to be feasible, is now available.

The interventions tested were 1) physician counseling, 2) mailed letters and educational materials designed by the National Cancer Institute (NCI), and 3) referral to smoking cessation classes. Thirty-seven family practice physicians at three of Group Health's outpatient facilities participated. Patient participation rates were 95%, and follow-up was complete for 92% of those participating. None of the interventions had any effect on point prevalence of quitting as determined 8-9 months later by self-report. However, the combination of physician counseling and NCI materials doubled the odds of occurrence of significant antismoking behavior (quit, quit and relapse, or cut down) during the ensuing 8-9 months in those individuals receiving that combination. Referral to smoking cessation classes was strikingly ineffective in this setting. Of 369 individuals designated by study design for referral, only 14% even investigated the classes. This compares with a 10% self-referral rate for those persons not designated for referral by our study design. Our results and other recent work suggest that more intensive interventions on multiple occasions based on relapse prevention strategies hold promise for future success in smoking cessation efforts in primary care.<doc-sep>",

SIFA (Studio Italiano Fibrillazione Atriale) Investigators.<doc-sep>The results of a large prospective randomized trial have shown the efficacy of oral anticoagulation in the secondary prevention of major vascular events in patients with nonrheumatic atrial fibrillation (NRAF); less well established is the role of antiplatelet agents. The present study compared the effects of indobufen, a reversible inhibitor of platelet cyclooxygenase, with those of warfarin in this setting.\n                A total of 916 patients with NRAF and a recent (< or = 15 days) cerebral ischemic episode were admitted to this multicenter, randomized study, during which they were treated with either indobufen (100 or 200 mg BID) or warfarin (to obtain an international normalized ratio of 2.0 to 3.5) for 12 months. The two groups (462 on indobufen and 454 on warfarin) were well balanced in terms of their main baseline characteristics. The primary outcome of the study was the combined incidence of nonfatal stroke (including intracerebral bleeding), pulmonary or systemic embolism, nonfatal myocardial infarction, and vascular death.\n                At the end of follow-up, the incidence of primary outcome events was 10.6% in the indobufen group (95% confidence interval, 7.7% to 13.5%) and 9.0% in the warfarin group (95% confidence interval, 6.3% to 11.8%), with no statistically significant difference between treatments. The frequency of noncerebral major bleeding complications was low: only four cases (0.9%) of gastrointestinal bleeding were observed, all of them in the warfarin group.\n                We conclude that, within the limitations of its design, this study may help the medical community in devising appropriate antithrombotic strategies for NRAF patients for whom oral anticoagulants are contraindicated or do not represent a feasible approach to treatment.<doc-sep>",

Between 1 January 1991 and 30 June 1991, 2040 women were randomly allocated either to the oxytocin (n = 1017) or the Syntometrine (n = 1023) group. Twelve patients had to be excluded from the trial (oxytocin, 5; Syntometrine, 7) after randomisation because they no longer fulfilled the inclusion criteria. All women in the trial received either oxytocin 10 units or Syntometrine 1 ml (oxytocin 5 units+ergometrine (ergonovine) 0.5 mg) by intramuscular injection with delivery of the anterior shoulder of the baby. Relative risk with 95% confidence intervals was calculated for each variable.\n                Oxytocin (10 units) alone was as effective as Syntometrine (1 ml) in preventing post-partum haemorrhage without an increase in the incidence of retained placenta. Median blood loss was similar in both groups. The incidences of nausea, vomiting and headache were significantly lower in the oxytocin group, as was the occurrence of a mean rise in diastolic and systolic blood pressures of 20 and 30 mmHg or more, respectively.\n                Prophylactic administration of oxytocin 10 U in the third stage of labour, as part of active management, reduces the incidence of maternal nausea, vomiting, headache and rise in blood pressure than does Syntometrine 1 ml without adversely affecting the rate of post partum haemorrhage.<doc-sep>Randomised controlled trial of oxytocin alone versus oxytocin and ergometrine in active management of third stage of labour.<doc-sep>To compare intramuscular oxytocin alone and intramuscular oxytocin with ergometrine (Syntometrine) for their effect in reducing the risk of postpartum haemorrhage when both are used as part of the active management of the third stage of labour.\n                Double blind, randomised controlled trial.\n                Two metropolitan teaching hospitals in Perth, Western Australia.\n                All women who expected a vaginal birth during the period of the trial. Informed consent was obtained.\n                Postpartum haemorrhage, nausea, vomiting, and increased blood pressure.\n                3497 women were randomly allocated to receive oxytocin-ergometrine (n = 1730) or oxytocin (n = 1753). Rates of postpartum haemorrhage (> or = 500 ml or > or = 1000 ml) were similar in both arms (odds ratio 0.90 (0.82); 95% confidence interval 0.75 to 1.07 (0.59 to 1.14) at 500 ml (1000 ml) threshold). The use of oxytocin-ergometrine was associated with nausea, vomiting, and increased blood pressure.\n                There are few advantages but several disadvantages for the routine use of oxytoxinergometrine when prophylactic active management of the third stage of labour is practised. Further investigation of dose-response for oxytocin may be warranted.<doc-sep>The Salford Third Stage Trial.

The duration of the 3rd stage of labor in each group was similar (difference in means 0.2 mins; 95% confidence interval [CI], -1.0 to 1.5) and the need for manual removal of the placenta (odds ratio [OR] 1.21; 95% CI, 0.37 to 4.00). There was less postpartum blood loss in the oxytocin plus ergometrine group, reflected in the lower incidence of primary postpartum hemorrhage (> 500 mL) (OR 0.37; 95% CI, 0.16 to 0.85).\n                Judged on the basis of this trial alone, oxytocin plus ergometrine is more effective than oxytocin alone in the prevention of postpartum hemorrhage. However, evidence from other trials shows that the ergometrine component not uncommonly has side effects of nausea, vomiting, and raised blood pressure. The implications for practice therefore depend on the relative weights placed on these competing risks by women and clinicians. Further research is needed to quantify these along with research into possible differential effects on longer-term outcomes and into the implications of a higher dose of oxytocin.<doc-sep>A randomised double blind comparison of Syntometrine and Syntocinon in the management of the third stage of labour.<doc-sep>To compare the effect of intramuscular Syntometrine and Syntocinon in the management of the third stage of labour.\n                A randomised double blind prospective study.\n                Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, Prince of Wales Hospital, Hong Kong.\n                One thousand consecutive patients with singleton pregnancy and vaginal delivery in February and March 1993.\n                The use of Syntometrine in the management of the third stage not only reduced the blood loss after delivery but was associated with a 40% reduction in the risk of postpartum haemorrhage (odds ratio 0.60; 95% CI 0.21-0.88), and the need for repeat oxytocic injections (odds ratio of 0.63; 95% CI 0.44-0.89). The two drugs did not differ in their effect on the duration of the third stage. However, the incidence of manual removal of the placenta was higher when Syntometrine was used (odds ratio 3.7; 95% CI 1.03-12.5), although the overall incidence remained low. Side effects from both drugs, such as nausea, vomiting, headache and hypertension, were uncommon.\n                Intramuscular Syntometrine is a better choice than Syntocinon in the management of the third stage of labour.<doc-sep>",
         "The use of ergometrine-oxytocin as part of the routine active management of the third stage of labour appears to be associated with a small but statistically significant reduction in the risk of PPH when compared to oxytocin for blood loss of 500 ml or more. No statistically significant difference was observed between the groups for blood loss of 1000 ml or more. A statistically significant difference was observed in the presence of maternal side-effects, including elevation of diastolic blood pressure, vomiting and nausea, associated with ergometrine-oxytocin use compared to oxytocin use. Thus, the advantage of a reduction in the risk of PPH, between 500 and 1000 ml blood loss, needs to be weighed against the adverse side-effects associated with the use of ergometrine-oxytocin.",

Eleven out of 20 patients completed 24 weeks of therapy with etretinate (up to 0.5 mg/kg/day) whereas only 1/20 patients completed 24 weeks of therapy with ibuprofen alone. Etretinate improved skin lesions, and this may have encouraged patients to persist with it. Improvement of statistical significance was seen for articular index in both groups. In addition significant improvement in ESR, haemoglobin, C-reactive protein, and histidine occurred in the etretinate group. The main side effects of etretinate (which may preclude its use at a higher dose in this condition) included cracked and dried lips and sore mouth.<doc-sep>Therapeutic value of colchicine in the treatment of patients with psoriatic arthritis.<doc-sep>To test the hypothesis that colchicine is an effective treatment of psoriatic arthritis.\n                Twenty five patients with psoriatic arthritis were entered into a two centre, double blind, crossover study of 23 weeks' duration comparing the therapeutic effect of colchicine (0.6-1.8 mg/day) with placebo.\n                No significant difference was noted between colchicine or placebo treatment for the primary outcome measure (Lansbury joint count) or any of the seven secondary outcome measures. No change in the psoriasis was noted during active or placebo treatment. Adverse clinical effects were reported more often during treatment with colchicine (14 patients) than with the placebo (four patients), resulting in the early withdrawal of three patients receiving colchicine from the trial. Increased creatine kinase values, without weakness, occurred during treatment with colchicine (five patients) and placebo (four patients).\n                In conclusion, our study did not provide evidence that colchicine is of therapeutic value in the treatment of psoriatic arthritis.<doc-sep>Sulfasalazine therapy for psoriatic arthritis: a double blind, placebo controlled trial.<doc-sep>Psoriatic arthritis (PsA) is often poorly responsive to 2nd line antirheumatic drug therapy. Sulfasalazine has recently gained wide acceptance in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, and beneficial effects have also been noted in ankylosing spondylitis and reactive arthritis. We report a double blind placebo controlled study of sulfasalazine in PsA.\n                Twenty-four patients with active PsA were randomized to receive either sulfasalazine (3 g/day) (n = 10) or placebo (n = 14) for 8 weeks, in a double blind manner, followed by an 8 week open label crossover phase for nonresponding placebo patients.\n                Compared with placebo controls, sulfasalazine treated patients were significantly improved at Weeks 4 and 8 with respect to physician (p < 0.01) and patient (p < 0.05) global assessments. Duration of morning stiffness was significantly decreased at Week 8 (p < 0.01). Clinical variables of disease activity returned to baseline after a 4 week drug washout period in 5 evaluable patients. Six patients in the placebo group crossed over to an 8 week open label phase and demonstrated significant improvements in joint scores, 50 ft walking time, and global patient assessment. Sulfasalazine treated patients also showed significant improvements in cutaneous involvement.\n                Sulfasalazine was effective in PsA, with efficacy observed as early as the 4th week of treatment. Longterm studies are needed to determine whether such therapy can modify disease outcome.<doc-sep>A multicentre double-blind comparison of auranofin, intramuscular gold thiomalate and placebo in patients with psoriatic arthritis.<doc-sep>The efficacy and safety of the oral gold compound auranofin and intramuscular gold thiomalate have been compared in a placebo-controlled, double-blind, four-centre trial in 82 patients with psoriatic arthritis requiring remittive drug therapy. There were statistically significant falls in Ritchie articular index, visual analogue pain score and ESR at 12 and 24 weeks following i.m. gold but no significant changes in the auranofin group. Intramuscular gold was safe and more effective than auranofin as a second-line, suppressive antirheumatic agent for patients with psoriatic arthritis when followed for 6 months.<doc-sep>Randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled trial of low-dose pulse methotrexate in psoriatic arthritis.<doc-sep>Thirty-seven patients with psoriatic arthritis were entered into a 12-week prospective, controlled, double-blind multicenter trial comparing placebo and oral pulse methotrexate therapy. Methotrexate was given in a dose of 2.5-5.0 mg every 12 hours in 3 consecutive doses per week. A stable background medication program with nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs was allowed. Methotrexate was superior to placebo only in physician assessment of arthritis activity and in improvement of the amount of skin surface area with psoriasis. A small but statistically significant rise of serum total bilirubin occurred in the methotrexate-treated patients. No patients were withdrawn from the study for adverse drug effects.<doc-sep>A double-blind placebo-controlled study of auranofin in patients with psoriatic arthritis.<doc-sep>Two hundred thirty-eight patients with psoriatic arthritis were entered into a 6-month, multicenter, double-blind trial comparing auranofin and placebo.

Auranofin treatment was statistically superior to placebo treatment, according to physician's global assessment and functional scores. A trend in favor of auranofin treatment was seen for each of the other disease parameters studied. Psoriasis worsened in 6 auranofin-treated patients and in 3 placebo-treated patients. The incidence and nature of other side effects were similar to those observed in similar trials of patients with rheumatoid arthritis. Our observations suggest that the use of auranofin in the treatment of psoriatic arthritis is safe, although its therapeutic advantage over treatment with nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs alone is modest.<doc-sep>Fumaric acid therapy for psoriatic arthritis.

Treatment response was based on joint pain/ tenderness and swelling scores and physician and patient global assessments.\n                Longitudinal analysis revealed a trend favoring SSZ treatment (P = 0.13). At the end of treatment, response rates were 57.8% for SSZ compared with 44.6% for placebo (P = 0.05). The Westergren erythrocyte sedimentation rate declined more in the PsA patients taking SSZ than in those taking placebo (P < 0.0001). Adverse reactions were fewer than expected and were mainly due to nonspecific gastrointestinal complaints, including dyspepsia, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea.\n                SSZ at a dosage of 2,000 mg/day is well tolerated and may be more effective than placebo in the treatment of patients with PsA.<doc-sep>Sulphasalazine in psoriatic arthritis: a double-blind placebo-controlled study.<doc-sep>Sulphasalazine (SASP) is now accepted as an effective slow-acting antirheumatic drug for treating active rheumatoid arthritis (RA), but has not been previously evaluated in psoriatic arthritis. An earlier open study suggested that it was well tolerated and potentially beneficial. The present double-blind placebo-controlled trial of 30 patients has now confirmed its efficacy. Greater improvement occurred in those patients on active treatment than on placebo, with more benefit being detected in those patients with the symmetrical polyarticular but seronegative pattern of arthritis associated with a high acute-phase response. SASP was stopped in 26% because of side-effects but these were mild. No exacerbation or remission of psoriasis was observed.

A total of 120 patients were included in nine centres. All patients had active disease and fulfilled the criteria of definite psoriatic arthritis of at least 3 months duration. They received either SSZ (2.0 g/day) or placebo. Efficacy variables included pain, patient's overall assessment of joint and skin improvement, morning stiffness, Ritchie articular index, ESR and CRP. An intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis was performed for the 117 patients who qualified (three patients did not qualify due to missing data after baseline). A per-protocol analysis was performed for the 81 patients who completed the 6 months study period (SSZ = 38, placebo = 43). Major reasons for withdrawal were inadequate response (SSZ = 4, placebo = 7) and adverse events (SSZ = 8, placebo = 12). Pain was the only statistically significantly different primary outcome variable at end point in favour of SSZ in the ITT analysis. No significant differences were present in other clinical or biological variables, although there was a trend in favour of SSZ for some variables. SSZ, at a dose of 2.0 g/day, appeared to be a safe treatment in patients with psoriatic arthritis. At this dosage, its efficacy was only demonstrated for the pain variable.<doc-sep>Sulphasalazine in the management of psoriatic arthritis.<doc-sep>There are few 'second-line' drugs available for the treatment of PSA and their use is often limited by toxicity. Thirty-nine patients with active PSA recruited from two rheumatology units were randomly allocated to either enteric-coated sulphasalazine (SASP) or placebo and followed for 24 wk. Six patients in the SASP group and 11 on placebo discontinued therapy before 24 wk. Evaluation of effect of treatment revealed significant improvements in articular index in both groups at 12 wk. By 24 wk the articular index in placebo group was still showing benefit. In addition to articular index the SASP group improved significantly in terms of visual analogue scale, duration of morning stiffness and ESR. SASP is effective in PSA but the partial clinical response to placebo indicates the importance of placebo-controlled studies in this variable disease.<doc-sep>",

Before early aneurysm operation, repeated CBF measurements were made to evaluate the cerebral vascular reactivity to controlled hyperventilation. Thirteen individuals received intravenous treatment with the calcium channel blocker nimodipine, whereas the other seven patients did not receive such specific antiischemic treatment. Five of the latter patients had an impaired CO2 response, and three showed delayed ischemic deterioration (DID), whereas none of the seven nimodipine-treated patients with impaired CO2 response showed DID. One nimodipine-treated patient with a preserved CO2 response, in whom operation was complicated, developed DID. The observed findings indicate that DID after uncomplicated early aneurysm operation may be associated with an early disturbance of cerebral vasoreactivity. Treatment with nimodipine may counteract the development of DID in patients with an impaired CBF CO2 response.<doc-sep>Magnesium sulfate therapy after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage.<doc-sep>Vasospasm remains a significant source of neurological morbidity and mortality following aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), despite advances in current medical, surgical, and endovascular therapies. Magnesium sulfate therapy has been demonstrated to be both safe and effective in preventing neurological complications in obstetrical patients with eclampsia. Evidence obtained using experimental models of brain injury, cerebral ischemia, and SAH indicate that Mg may also have a role as a neuroprotective agent. The authors hypothesize that MgSO4 therapy is safe, feasible, and has a beneficial effect on vasospasm and, ultimately, on neurological outcome following aneurysmal SAH.\n                A prospective randomized single-blind clinical trial of high-dose MgSO4 therapy following aneurysmal SAH (Hunt and Hess Grades II-IV) was performed in 40 patients, who were enrolled within 72 hours following SAH and given intravenous MgSO4 or control solution for 10 days. Serum Mg++ levels were maintained in the 4 to 5.5 mg/dl range throughout the treatment period. Clinical management principles were the same between groups (including early use of surgery or endovascular treatment, followed by aggressive vasospasm prophylaxis and treatment). Daily transcranial Doppler (TCD) ultrasonographic recordings were obtained, and clinical outcomes were measured using the Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS). The patients' GOS scores and the TCD recordings were analyzed using the independent t-test. Forty patients were enrolled in the study: 20 (15 female and five male patients) received treatment and 20 (11 female and nine male patients) comprised a control group. The mean ages of the patients in these groups were 46 and 51, respectively, and the mean clinical Hunt and Hess grades were 2.6 +/- 0.68 in the MgSO4 treatment group and 2.3 +/- 0.73 in the control group (mean +/- standard deviation [SD], p = 0.87). Fisher grades were similar in both groups. Mean middle cerebral artery velocities were 93 +/- 27 cm/second in MgSO4-treated patients and 102 +/- 34 cm/second in the control group (mean +/- SD, p = 0.41). Symptomatic vasospasm, confirmed by angiography, occurred in six of 20 patients receiving MgSO4 and in five of 16 patients receiving placebo. Mean GOS scores were 3.8 +/- 1.6 and 3.6 +/- 1.5 (mean +/- SD, p = 0.74) in the treatment and control groups, respectively. Significant adverse effects from treatment with MgSO4 did not occur.\n                Administration of high-dose MgSO4 following aneurysmal SAH is safe, and steady Mg++ levels in the range of 4 to 5.5 mg/dl are easily maintained. This treatment does not interfere with neurological assessment, administration of anesthesia during surgery, or other aspects of clinical care. We observed a trend in which a higher percentage of patients obtained GOS scores of 4 or 5 in the group treated with MgSO4, but the trend did not reach a statistically significant level. A larger study is needed to evaluate this trend further.<doc-sep>Effect of AT877 on cerebral vasospasm after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage. Results of a prospective placebo-controlled double-blind trial.<doc-sep>With the cooperation of 60 neurosurgical centers in Japan, a prospective randomized placebo-controlled double-blind trial of a new calcium antagonist AT877 (hexahydro-1-(5-isoquinolinesulfonyl)-1H-1,4-diazepine hydrochloride, or fasudil hydrochloride) was undertaken to determine the drug's effect on delayed cerebral vasospasm in patients with a ruptured cerebral aneurysm. A total of 276 patients, who underwent surgery within 3 days after subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) of Hunt and Hess Grades I to IV, were entered into the study. Nine patients were excluded because of protocol violation. The remaining 267 patients received either 30 mg AT877 or a placebo (saline) by intravenous injection over 30 minutes, three times a day for 14 days following surgery. Demographic and clinical data were well matched between the two groups. It was found that AT877 reduced angiographically demonstrable vasospasm by 38% (from 61% in the placebo group to 38% in the AT877 group, p = 0.0023), low-density regions on computerized tomography associated with vasospasm by 58% (from 38% to 16%, p = 0.0013), and symptomatic vasospasm by 30% (from 50% to 35%, p = 0.0247). Furthermore, AT877 reduced the number of patients with a poor clinical outcome associated with vasospasm (moderate disability or worse on the Glasgow Outcome Scale at 1 month after SAH) by 54% (from 26% to 12%, p = 0.0152). There were no serious adverse events reported in the AT877 group. This is the first report of a placebo-controlled double-blind trial that has demonstrated a significant reduction in angiographically revealed vasospasm by intravenous drug therapy.<doc-sep>Effect of nimodipine on platelet function in patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage.<doc-sep>We studied platelet function in 41 patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage who were randomized to receive either nimodipine or placebo in a double-blind fashion. Nimodipine was given to 21 patients, intravenously for 7-10 days and then orally until 21 days after the subarachnoid hemorrhage. The other 20 patients received placebo in a similar manner. Nimodipine did not significantly influence platelet aggregability. For the first 1-5 days after the subarachnoid hemorrhage, nimodipine treatment did not have any notable effect on adenosine diphosphate-induced platelet thromboxane B2 release, but a significant (p less than 0.05) inhibitory effect was observed thereafter. During intravenous administration, nimodipine prevented the increase in thromboxane release otherwise observed after subarachnoid hemorrhage. Concomitant with the decrease in thromboxane release, nimodipine increased the platelet count both before and after surgery so that the capacity for thromboxane formation per liter of blood decreased less than expected on the basis of thromboxane release per 10(7) platelets. Our study suggests that nimodipine might diminish the chance of cerebral ischemia by inhibiting platelet thromboxane release.<doc-sep>Controlled study of nimodipine in aneurysm patients treated early after subarachnoid hemorrhage.<doc-sep>We enrolled 75 consecutive patients admitted with subarachnoid hemorrhages in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to determine the effect of early intervention with nimodipine on outcome and cerebral blood flow. The cardioprotective effect of nimodipine was assessed by measuring the electrocardiographic changes over the first 3 days of drug treatment. There was a mild lowering of the mean cerebral blood flow in the nimodipine-treated group over the 21-day period. Analysis of the continuous electrocardiographic traces showed no difference between the nimodipine and placebo groups in the frequency or type of abnormality detected. At 3 months, 4 of the 38 patients receiving nimodipine had died, compared with 10 of the 37 placebo-receiving patients. Of the 50 eligible patients who had a proven cerebral aneurysm, 1 patient (4%) on nimodipine died compared with 6 (24%) receiving placebo (0.01 less than P less than 0.05, chi 2 test; approximate 95% confidence interval for mortality difference, 0.4% to 39.6%). We conclude that nimodipine does not increase the cerebral blood flow or protect the heart after a subarachnoid hemorrhage. There were no side effects from nimodipine. The trend toward improved outcome should be verified in a larger series of patients.<doc-sep>Magnesium sulfate in aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage: a randomized controlled trial.<doc-sep>Magnesium reverses cerebral vasospasm and reduces infarct volume after experimental subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) in rats. We aimed to assess whether magnesium reduces the frequency of delayed cerebral ischemia (DCI) in patients with aneurysmal SAH.\n                Patients were randomized within 4 days after SAH. Magnesium sulfate therapy consisted of a continuous intravenous dose of 64 mmol/L per day, to be started within 4 days after SAH and continued until 14 days after occlusion of the aneurysm. The primary outcome DCI (defined as the occurrence of a new hypodense lesion on computed tomography compatible with clinical features of DCI) was analyzed according to the \"on-treatment\" principle. For the secondary outcome measures \"poor outcome\" (Rankin >3) and \"excellent outcome\" (Rankin 0), we used the \"intention-to-treat\" principle.\n                A total of 283 patients were randomized. Magnesium treatment reduced the risk of DCI by 34% (hazard ratio, 0.66; 95% CI, 0.38 to 1.14). After 3 months, the risk reduction for poor outcome was 23% (risk ratio, 0.77; 95% CI, 0.54 to 1.09). At that time, 18 patients in the treatment group and 6 in the placebo group had an excellent outcome (risk ratio, 3.4; 95% CI, 1.3 to 8.9).\n                This study suggests that magnesium reduces DCI and subsequent poor outcome, but the results are not yet definitive. A next step should be a phase III trial to confirm the beneficial effect of magnesium therapy, with poor outcome as primary outcome.<doc-sep>Prevention of vasospasm in subarachnoid haemorrhage. A controlled study with nimodipine.<doc-sep>A prospective randomized double blind study was conducted in 70 patients suffering from subarachnoid haemorrhage, due to aneurysm rupture, to determine if the use of nimodipine reduces the severity of ischaemic deficits secondary to vasospasm.

Angiographic vasospasm was not significantly different in its frequency or its severity between the two groups. However, the association of extensive and diffuse vasospasm was less frequent in the nimodipine group. This study confirms the effectiveness of Nimodipine in reducing the occurrence of neurological deficit due to vasospasm, even if this action is not observed in all cases.<doc-sep>Cerebral arterial spasm--a controlled trial of nimodipine in patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage.<doc-sep>We enrolled 125 neurologically normal patients with intracranial aneurysms in a multi-institution, prospective, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial within 96 hours of their subarachnoid hemorrhage, to determine whether treatment with the calcium blocker nimodipine would prevent or reduce the severity of ischemic neurologic deficits from arterial spasm. A deficit from cerebral arterial spasm that persisted and was severe or caused death by the end of the 21-day treatment period occurred in 8 of 60 patients given placebo and in 1 of 56 given nimodipine (P = 0.03, Fisher's exact test). Analysis of the amount of basal subarachnoid blood on pre-entry CAT scans in patients with deficits from spasm showed that an increase in subarachnoid blood was not associated with a worse neurologic outcome among patients who received nimodipine, unlike the situation in patients given a placebo. There were no side effects from nimodipine. We conclude that nimodipine should be given to patients who are neurologically normal after subarachnoid hemorrhage in order to reduce the occurrence of severe neurologic deficits due to cerebral arterial spasm.<doc-sep>Effect of oral nimodipine on cerebral infarction and outcome after subarachnoid haemorrhage: British aneurysm nimodipine trial.<doc-sep>To determine the efficacy of oral nimodipine in reducing cerebral infarction and poor outcomes (death and severe disability) after subarachnoid haemorrhage.\n                Double blind, placebo controlled, randomised trial with three months of follow up and intention to treat analysis. To have an 80% chance with a significance level of 0.05 of detecting a 50% reduction in an incidence of cerebral infarction of 15% a minimum of 540 patients was required.\n                Four regional neurosurgical units in the United Kingdom.\n                In all 554 patients were recruited between June 1985 and September 1987 out of a population of 1115 patients admitted with subarachnoid haemorrhage proved by the results of lumbar puncture or computed tomography, or both. The main exclusion criterion was admission to the neurosurgical units more than 96 hours after subarachnoid haemorrhage. There were four breaks of code and no exclusions after entry. One patient was withdrawn and in 130 treatment was discontinued early. All patients were followed up for three months and were included in the analysis, except the patient who had been withdrawn.\n                Placebo or nimodipine 60 mg was given orally every four hours for 21 days to 276 and 278 patients, respectively. Treatment was started within 96 hours after subarachnoid haemorrhage.\n                Incidence of cerebral infarction and ischaemic neurological deficits and outcome three months after entry.\n                Demographic and clinical data, including age, sex, history of hypertension and subarachnoid haemorrhage, severity of haemorrhage according to an adaptation of the Glasgow coma scale, number and site of aneurysms on angiography, and initial findings on computed tomography were measured at entry. Deterioration, defined as development of a focal sign or fall of more than one point on the Glasgow coma scale for more than six hours, was investigated by using clinical criteria and by computed tomography, by lumbar puncture, or at necropsy when appropriate. All episodes of deterioration and all patients with a three month outcome other than a good recovery were assessed by a review committee.\n                Demographic and clinical data at entry were similar in the two groups. In patients given nimodipine the incidence of cerebral infarction was 22% (61/278) compared with 33% (92/276) in those given placebo, a significant reduction of 34% (95% confidence interval 13 to 50%). Poor outcomes were also significantly reduced by 40% (95% confidence interval 20 to 55%) with nimodipine (20% (55/278) in patients given nimodipine v 33% (91/278) in those given placebo).\n                Oral nimodipine 60 mg four hourly is well tolerated and reduces cerebral infarction snd improves outcome after subarachnoid haemorrhage.<doc-sep>",
         "Calcium antagonists reduce the risk of poor outcome and secondary ischaemia after aneurysmal SAH. The results for 'poor outcome' depend largely on a single large trial of oral nimodipine; the evidence for other calcium antagonists is inconclusive. The evidence for nimodipine is not beyond all doubt, but given the potential benefits and modest risks of this treatment, oral nimodipine is currently indicated in patients with aneurysmal SAH. Intravenous administration of calcium antagonists cannot be recommended for routine practice on the basis of the present evidence.

The response of active symptomatic disease to prednisone or sulfasalazine was significantly better than to placebo. Response to azathioprine was better than to placebo, but the difference did not reach conventional levels of statistical significance. Patients with colonic involvement were especially responsive to sulfasalazine, and those with small bowel involvement were especially responsive to prednisone. Patients' drug therapy immediately before entry to the study significantly affected subsequent response. For patients with quiescent disease, none of the drugs was superior to placebo in prophylaxis against flare-up or recurrence. There is less than a 5% risk that a clinically significant prophylactic effect of any of the drug regimens was missed.<doc-sep>European Cooperative Crohn's Disease Study (ECCDS): results of drug treatment.<doc-sep>A multicenter double-blind study of the effectiveness of sulfasalazine and 6-methylprednisolone, alone and in combination, was conducted on 452 patients with Crohn's disease. One hundred sixty patients were previously untreated; 292 patients were previously treated. The Crohn's disease activity index (CDAI) was used to determine whether a patient had active (CDAI greater than or equal to 150, n = 215) or quiescent disease (CDAI less than 150, n = 237). Treatment of active disease consisted of high-dose 6-methylprednisolone, 6-methylprednisolone combined with 3 g of sulfasalazine, 3 g of sulfasalazine alone, or placebo, and lasted 6 wk. Patients in remission received maintenance doses of one of these drug regimens for periods of up to 2 yr. One hundred ninety-two patients completed the 2-yr study period. Results were evaluated using life-table analysis and outcome ranking. These methods showed 6-methylprednisolone to be the most effective drug in overall comparison of all patients (p less than 0.001); in previously treated patients (p less than 0.001); and in subgroups: active disease (p less than 0.001), only small bowel disease (p less than 0.05), and both small bowel and colon disease (p less than 0.05). Combination of 6-methylprednisolone and sulfasalazine was the most effective regimen in previously untreated patients (p less than 0.05) and when disease was localized in the colon (p less than 0.001). Sulfasalazine alone was least effective in overall comparison of all patients (p less than 0.05) and in all strata. Drug treatment was of no significant benefit to patients with quiescent disease. Continuous administration of low doses of 6-methylprednisolone, or the combination regimen, was beneficial in patients who responded initially to treatment of active disease. The addition of sulfasalazine, however, offered no advantage.<doc-sep>Low dose steroids and clinical relapse in Crohn's disease: a controlled trial.<doc-sep>The long-term effect of prednisone in Crohn's disease has been examined in a double-blind controlled trial.

The objective of this randomized controlled trial was to test the effect of CHF CM on the 90-day readmission rate in a more heterogeneous setting.\n                A total of 287 patients admitted to the hospital with the primary or secondary diagnosis of CHF, left ventricular dysfunction of less than 40%, or radiologic evidence of pulmonary edema for which they underwent diuresis were randomized. The intervention consisted of 4 major components: early discharge planning, patient and family CHF education, 12 weeks of telephone follow-up, and promotion of optimal CHF medications.\n                The 90-day readmission rates were equal for the CM and usual care groups (37%). Total inpatient and outpatient median costs and readmission median cost were reduced 14% and 26%, respectively, for the intervention group. Patients in the CM group were more likely to be taking CHF medication at target doses, but dosages did not increase significantly throughout 12 weeks. Although both groups took their medications as prescribed equally well, the rest of the adherence to treatment plan was significantly better in the CM group. Subgroup analysis of patients who lived locally and saw a cardiologist showed a significant decrease in CHF readmissions for the intervention group (P =.03).\n                These results suggest several limitations to the generalizability of the CHF CM-improved outcome link in a heterogeneous setting. One explanation is that the lack of coordinated system supports and varied accessibility to care in an extended, nonnetworked physician setting limits the effectiveness of the CM.<doc-sep>The effect of a clinical pharmacist discharge service on medication discrepancies in patients with heart failure.<doc-sep>Heart failure patients are regularly admitted to hospital and frequently use multiple medication. Besides intentional changes in pharmacotherapy, unintentional changes may occur during hospitalisation. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of a clinical pharmacist discharge service on medication discrepancies and prescription errors in patients with heart failure.\n                A general teaching hospital in Tilburg, the Netherlands.\n                An open randomized intervention study was performed comparing an intervention group, with a control group receiving regular care by doctors and nurses. The clinical pharmacist discharge service consisted of review of discharge medication, communicating prescribing errors with the cardiologist, giving patients information, preparation of a written overview of the discharge medication and communication to both the community pharmacist and the general practitioner about this medication. Within 6 weeks after discharge all patients were routinely scheduled to visit the outpatient clinic and medication discrepancies were measured.\n                The primary endpoint was the frequency of prescription errors in the discharge medication and medication discrepancies after discharge combined.\n                Forty-four patients were included in the control group and 41 in the intervention group. Sixty-eight percent of patients in the control group had at least one discrepancy or prescription error against 39% in the intervention group (RR 0.57 (95% CI 0.37-0.88)). The percentage of medications with a discrepancy or prescription error in the control group was 14.6% and in the intervention group it was 6.1% (RR 0.42 (95% CI 0.27-0.66)).\n                This clinical pharmacist discharge service significantly reduces the risk of discrepancies and prescription errors in medication of patients with heart failure in the 1st month after discharge.<doc-sep>Comprehensive discharge planning for the hospitalized elderly.

Patients were 70 years and older and were placed in selected medical and surgical cardiac diagnostic-related groups.\n                Group differences in patient outcomes (length of initial hospital stay, length of time between initial hospital discharge and readmission, and rehospitalization rates) and charges for care (charges for initial hospitalization, rehospitalizations, health services after discharge, and nurse specialist services) were measured 2, 6, and 12 weeks after discharge.\n                From the initial hospital discharge to 6 weeks after discharge, patients in the medical intervention group had fewer readmissions, fewer total days rehospitalized, lower readmission charges, and lower charges for health care services after discharge. No differences in these outcomes were found between the surgical intervention and control groups during this period.\n                Study findings support the need for comprehensive discharge planning designed for the elderly and implemented by nurse specialists to improve their outcomes after hospital discharge and to achieve cost savings.

Care of these patients from the moment they enter the hospital until discharge and postdischarge is a challenging task, requiring a coordinated approach by an interdisciplinary team.\n                An experimental design was used. Methods. Fifty hip fracture patients were recruited from a medical centre in Taipei, Taiwan and randomly divided into two groups. The control group received routine discharge nursing care and the experimental group received comprehensive discharge planning. After patient admission, researchers assessed discharge-planning needs, provided discharge nursing instruction, coordinated services and determined discharge placement based on assessment results.\n                (i) Mean age of 50 hip fracture patients was 78.75 (SD 6.99) years. Mean length of stay was 6.04 (SD 2.41) days for the experimental group and 6.29 (SD 2.17) for the control group. Difference between groups was not significant (t = -0.394, p = 0.696). (ii) The self-care knowledge of the experimental group was higher than that of the control group (F = 11.569, p = 0.001). (iii) Significant improvements were observed in functional status of both groups at three months postdischarge, with no significant differences observed between groups. However, the functional status of experimental group patients showed a slightly better trend than that of the control group. (iv) At three months postdischarge, QOL of experimental group patients was better than control group patients.\n                A comprehensive discharge-planning service can improve hip fracture patients' self-care knowledge and QOL. Relevance TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: Results of this study can be used clinically as a basis for practical implementation of discharge-planning services in fracture patients.<doc-sep>Benefits of home visits for falls and autonomy in the elderly: a randomized trial study.<doc-sep>To investigate whether home visits by a occupational therapist reduces the risk of falling and improves the autonomy of older patients hospitalized for falling.\n                In this randomized, controlled trial set in a geriatric hospital, 60 patients (mean age, 83.5 yr) who were hospitalized for falling were recruited from the acute medicine department. A home visit from an occupational therapist and an ergotherapist assessed patients' homes for environmental hazards and recommended modifications. The outcomes measured were falls, autonomy, hospitalization for falling, institutionalization, and death.\n                During the follow-up period, the rate of falls, hospitalization for falls, institutionalization, and death were not significantly different between the two groups. Both groups had a loss of dependence at 12 mo. This loss of dependence was significant in the control group but not in the intervention group.\n                Home visits from occupational therapists during hospitalization of older patients at risk for falling can help to preserve the patient's autonomy.<doc-sep>Effects of a multidisciplinary, post-discharge continuance of care intervention on quality of life, discharge satisfaction, and hospital length of stay: a randomized controlled trial.<doc-sep>To determine the impact of a hospital-coordinated discharge care plan, involving a multidisciplinary team of primary health care providers, on hospital length of stay, quality of life, and both patient and general practitioner inclusion in, and satisfaction with, discharge procedures.\n                This investigation comprised a prospective, randomized, controlled, clinical trial.\n                This multicentre and cross-jurisdictional study focused on areas of tertiary and primary health care as well as community allied health in Western Australia.\n                Patients (n = 189) with chronic cardiorespiratory diagnoses were recruited from respiratory, cardiovascular, and general medical wards at two tertiary hospitals.\n                Subjects were randomly assigned to one of two groups. Intervention group patients received a discharge care plan in accordance with that outlined in the Australian Enhanced Primary Care Package, completed before discharge and sent to the patient's general practitioner and other community service providers for review. Control patients were discharged under existing hospital processes. Outcome measures. Patients and general practitioners were surveyed pre-discharge and 7 days post-discharge for quality of life and opinion of discharge procedures. Hospital length of stay was also determined.\n                Significant improvements in discharge planning involvement, health service access, confidence with discharge procedures, and opinion of discharge based on previous experience were seen for patients who received the discharge care plan. Further, improved perceptions of mental quality of life were observed within the first week post-discharge for intervention patients. Length of stay showed no difference between groups. Extent and speed of hospital-general practitioner communication were significantly improved via the intervention.\n                Our results indicate that a multidisciplinary discharge care plan, initiated before separation, improves quality of life, involvement, and satisfaction with discharge care, and hospital-general practitioner integration.

A nurse employed by the Municipality particularly for this project visited the hospital daily and followed the 135 participants in the intervention group with the objects of obtaining information from the primary sector if necessary, discussing discharge with the patient and the hospital staff, coordinating possible supportive measures in the patient's home and visiting the patient in his home immediately after discharge from hospital in order to ensure continuity in care and treatment. The 138 participants in the control group underwent the usual procedures in connection with admission to hospital. In this article, the consequences of the contributions by the health visitor in the hospital are described in relation to the course of hospitalization.

Improving hospital-to-home transition for this population is a logical step in responding to current practice guidelines' recommendations for coordination and education. Positive outcomes have been reported from trials evaluating multiple interventions, enhanced hospital discharge, and follow-up through the addition of a case management role. The question remains if similar gains could be achieved working with usual hospital and community nurses.\n                A 12-week, prospective, randomized controlled trial was conducted of the effect of transitional care on health-related quality of life (disease-specific and generic measures), rates of readmission, and emergency room use. The nurse-led intervention focused on the transition from hospital-to-home and supportive care for self-management 2 weeks after hospital discharge.\n                At 6 weeks after hospital discharge, the overall Minnesota Living with Heart Failure Questionnaire (MLHFQ) score was better among the Transitional Care patients (27.2 +/- 19.1 SD) than among the Usual Care patients (37.5 +/- 20.3 SD; P = 0.002). Similar results were found at 12 weeks postdischarge for the overall MLHFQ and at 6- and 12-weeks postdischarge for the MLHFQ's Physical Dimension and Emotional Dimension subscales. Differences in generic quality life, as assessed by the SF-36 Physical component, Mental Component, and General Health subscales, were not significantly different between the Transition and Usual Care groups. At 12 weeks postdischarge, 31% of the Usual Care patients had been readmitted compared with 23% of the Transitional Care patients (P = 0.26), and 46% of the Usual Care group visited the emergency department compared with 29% in the Transitional Care group (chi2 = 4.86, df 1, P = 0.03).\n                There were significant improvements in health-related quality of life (HRQL) associated with Transitional Care and less use of emergency rooms.<doc-sep>Evaluation of a hospital-based community liaison pharmacy service in Northern Ireland.<doc-sep>To evaluate the impact of a hospital based community liaison pharmacy service on a range of outcomes in patients aged more than 55 years and taking more than 3 prescribed drugs, who had been admitted to the medical unit of a district general hospital in Northern Ireland.\n                Having recruited 243 patients, a total of 162 patients completed the full protocol (81 randomly assigned to intervention and 81 to control; mean age of control patients 75 years; mean age of intervention patients 73 years). The interventions by the community liaison pharmacist included: preparation of an accurate medication record following a full review of current medication use; medication counselling; provision of a medicines record sheet informing the patient how to take their drugs; provision of a pharmaceutical discharge letter detailing changes made to drug therapy (this was faxed to the patient's GP and community pharmacist on the day of discharge); provision of a Medicines Helpline.\n                The key findings were as follows: problems were identified in 80% of the intervention patients' prescription charts, 49% of which related to drug omissions from the patients' domiciliary prescriptions. The GP practice record was the most accurate (mean error rate 12.6%) while the GP referral letter was the least accurate (mean error rate 47.3%) source of medication information. Drugs patients brought to hospital were also an inaccurate source (mean error rate 44.0%). The intervention group patients, when compared with control patients, had a significant reduction (P = 0.005) in drug mismatch between drugs prescribed at discharge and taken at home, and had a greater knowledge of their drug regimen 10-14 days after discharge (P < 0.001). The vast majority of patients (96%) felt that the provision of a medicine helpline was a useful service.\n                The study indicated clear benefits from the involvement of a hospital based community liaison pharmacist in achieving seamless pharmaceutical care between the primary and secondary healthcare settings.<doc-sep>A multidisciplinary intervention to prevent the readmission of elderly patients with congestive heart failure.<doc-sep>Congestive heart failure is the most common indication for admission to the hospital among older adults. Behavioral factors, such as poor compliance with treatment, frequently contribute to exacerbations of heart failure, a fact suggesting that many admissions could be prevented.\n                We conducted a prospective, randomized trial of the effect of a nurse-directed, multidisciplinary intervention on rates of readmission within 90 days of hospital discharge, quality of life, and costs of care for high-risk patients 70 years of age or older who were hospitalized with congestive heart failure. The intervention consisted of comprehensive education of the patient and family, a prescribed diet, social-service consultation and planning for an early discharge, a review of medications, and intensive follow-up.\n                Survival for 90 days without readmission, the primary outcome measure, was achieved in 91 of the 142 patients in the treatment group, as compared with 75 of the 140 patients in the control group, who received conventional care (P = 0.09). There were 94 readmissions in the control group and 53 in the treatment group (risk ratio, 0.56; P = 0.02). The number of readmissions for heart failure was reduced by 56.2 percent in the treatment group (54 vs. 24, P = 0.04), whereas the number of readmissions for other causes was reduced by 28.5 percent (40 vs. 29, P not significant). In the control group, 23 patients (16.4 percent) had more than one readmission, as compared with 9 patients (6.3 percent) in the treatment group (risk ratio, 0.39; P = 0.01). In a subgroup of 126 patients, quality-of-life scores at 90 days improved more from base line for patients in the treatment group (P = 0.001). Because of the reduction in hospital admissions, the overall cost of care was $460 less per patient in the treatment group.\n                A nurse-directed, multidisciplinary intervention can improve quality of life and reduce hospital use and medical costs for elderly patients with congestive heart failure.<doc-sep>Does increased access to primary care reduce hospital readmissions? Veterans Affairs Cooperative Study Group on Primary Care and Hospital Readmission.<doc-sep>For chronically ill patients, readmission to the hospital can be frequent and costly. We studied the effect of an intervention designed to increase access to primary care after discharge from the hospital, with the goals of reducing readmissions and emergency department visits and increasing patients' quality of life and satisfaction with care.\n                In a multicenter randomized, controlled trial at nine Veterans Affairs Medical Centers, we randomly assigned 1396 veterans hospitalized with diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or congestive heart failure to receive either usual care or an intensive primary care intervention. The intervention involved close follow-up by a nurse and a primary care physician, beginning before discharge and continuing for the next six months.\n                The patients were severely ill. Half of those with congestive heart failure (504 patients) had disease in New York Heart Association class III or IV; 30 percent of those with diabetes (751 patients) had end-organ damage; and a quarter of those with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (583 patients) required home oxygen treatment or oral corticosteroids. The patients had extremely poor quality-of-life scores. Although they received more intensive primary care than the controls, the patients in the intervention group had significantly higher rates of readmission (0.19 vs 0.14 per month, P = 0.005) and more days of rehospitalization (10.2 vs 8.8, P = 0.041). The patients in the intervention group were more satisfied with their care (P < 0.001), but there was no difference between the study groups in quality-of-life scores, which remained very low (P = 0.53).\n                For veterans discharged from Veterans Affairs hospitals, the primary care intervention we studied increased rather than decreased the rate of rehospitalization, although patients in the intervention group were more satisfied with their care.<doc-sep>Prevention of readmission in elderly patients with congestive heart failure: results of a prospective, randomized pilot study.<doc-sep>To determine the feasibility and potential impact of a non-pharmacologic multidisciplinary intervention for reducing hospital readmissions in elderly patients with congestive heart failure.\n                Prospective, randomized clinical trial, with 2:1 assignment to the study intervention or usual care.\n                550-bed secondary and tertiary care university teaching hospital.\n                98 patients > or = 70 years of age (mean 79 +/- 6 years) admitted with documented congestive heart failure.\n                Comprehensive multidisciplinary treatment strategy consisting of intensive teaching by a geriatric cardiac nurse, a detailed review of medications by a geriatric cardiologist with specific recommendations designed to improve medication compliance and reduce side effects, early consultation with social services to facilitate discharge planning, dietary teaching by a hospital dietician, and close follow-up after discharge by home care and the study team.\n                All patients were followed for 90 days after initial hospital discharge. The primary study endpoints were rehospitalization within the 90-day interval and the cumulative number of days hospitalized during follow-up. The 90-day readmission rate was 33.3% (21.7%-44.9%) for the patients receiving the study intervention (n = 63) compared with 45.7% (29.2%-62.2%) for the control patients (n = 35). The mean number of days hospitalized was 4.3 +/- 1.1 (2.1-6.5) for the treated patients vs 5.7 +/- 2.0 (1.8-9.6) for the usual-care patients. In a prospectively defined subgroup of patients at intermediate risk for readmission (n = 61), readmissions were reduced by 42.2% (from 47.6% to 27.5%; p = 0.10), and the average number of hospital days during follow-up decreased from 6.7 +/- 3.2 days to 3.2 +/- 1.2 days (p = NS).\n                These pilot data suggest that a comprehensive, multidisciplinary approach to reducing repetitive hospitalizations in elderly patients with congestive heart failure may lead to a reduction in readmissions and hospital days, particularly in patients at moderate risk for early rehospitalization. Further evaluation of this treatment strategy, including an assessment of the cost-effectiveness, is warranted.<doc-sep>Effects of a medical team coordinator on length of hospital stay.<doc-sep>To determine the effect of a medical team coordinator (MTC) on the length of stay in a teaching hospital.\n                Randomized controlled trial.\n                Two of four general medical clinical teaching units (CTUs).\n                Patients admitted to the CTUs between July and October 1990 except those who were admitted directly to an intensive care unit or whose death was expected within 48 hours. The 267 patients were randomly assigned to receive either standard medical care or standard medical care plus MTC services.\n                The MTC was a baccalaureate nurse whose role was to facilitate administrative tasks such as discharge planning, to coordinate tests and procedures, and to collect and collate patient information.\n                Length of hospital stay. A subgroup of 40 patients was asked to complete a brief survey on medical care information and satisfaction.\n                The MTC intervention reduced the mean length of stay by 1.97 days (p less than or equal to 0.04, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.02 to 2.92 days). Subanalysis by diagnostic group revealed that most of this effect was in an ill-defined group of disorders. In the survey more patients in the MTC group than in the other group reported being satisfied with their medical care (89% v. 62%; p less than or equal to 0.05, 95% CI 2% to 52%).\n                The services of an MTC help to reduce the length of hospital stay for some groups of patients. Further research is necessary to examine which components of the MTC intervention are most effective and in what conditions.<doc-sep>Evaluating hospital discharge planning: a randomized clinical trial.<doc-sep>To select patients for early discharge planning, a randomized clinical trial evaluated a protocol that used risk factors identified upon hospital admission. The goal of the study was to determine if intervention with high-risk patients could reduce the need for hospital admission or skilled care. Of 13,255 patients screened, 835 study participants were identified as \"at risk\" for frequent health care resource use. Half of the high-risk patients were randomly assigned to the experimental group (n = 417) and received discharge planning from day 3 of their hospital stay, while the control group (n = 418) received discharge planning only if there was a written physician request. Those patients receiving early, systematic discharge planning experienced an increased likelihood of successful return to home after hospital admission and a decreased chance of unscheduled readmission for the 9-month study period. Length of the index hospital stay was not affected by early planning, however. The major clinical implication is the potential for discharge planners to decrease the need for, and use of, health care resources after hospital admission.<doc-sep>Reducing hospital costs for the geriatric patient admitted from the emergency department: a randomized trial.<doc-sep>To test the impact of a geriatric evaluation and management model on the costs of acute hospital management of emergently admitted older adults.\n                Randomized controlled trial. Patients were followed in the acute hospital from admission through discharge. Results based on both univariate and multiple regression analyses.\n                Private, nonprofit, academic medical center in a densely populated urban area.\n                Adults 70 years of age and older admitted from the Emergency Department to the medicine service (non-ICU admission) who did not have an internist on staff at the admitting hospital. Of 141 randomized patients, 111 (78.7%) met eligibility criteria.\n                Assignment of a geriatrician and a social worker as the primary managing team during the hospital stay.\n                Length of stay, total cost of acute hospital care, cost of laboratory, pharmacy, and rehabilitation services.\n                Patients in the intervention group had 2.1 fewer days of hospitalization, but this shorter length of stay was not statistically significant (P = 0.108). There were no differences in mortality or discharge disposition. In risk-adjusted, multiple regression analysis the intervention group had a statistically significant lower predicted total cost per patient than the usual care group (-$2,544, P = 0.029); assignment to the intervention group was associated with a lower predicted cost per patient for laboratory (including cardiology graphics) services (P = 0.007) and pharmacy costs (P = 0.047).\n                When controlled for important predictors of expected resource use, care provided by a geriatric management team resulted in a significant reduction in the cost of hospitalization. A reduction in the cost of laboratory, cardiographic, and pharmacy services is consistent with the team's philosophy of defining the services needed based on goals related to functional outcomes.<doc-sep>Randomized controlled trial of integrated (managed) care pathway for stroke rehabilitation.<doc-sep>Integrated Care Pathway (ICP) is an organized, goal-defined, and time-managed plan that has the potential of facilitating timely interdisciplinary coordination, improving discharge planning, and reducing length of hospital stay.\n                An ICP for stroke rehabilitation based on evidence of best practice, professional standards, and existing infrastructure was developed. Its effectiveness was tested in 152 stroke patients undergoing rehabilitation who were randomized to receive ICP care coordinated by an experienced nurse (n=76) or conventional multidisciplinary care (n=76).\n                The age, sex, premorbid functional ability, and stroke characteristics of the 2 groups were comparable. There were no differences in mortality rates (10 [13%] versus 6 [8%]), institutionalization (10 [13%] versus 16 [21%]), or length of hospital stay (50+/-19 versus 45+/-23 days) between patients receiving ICP or multidisciplinary care. Patients receiving conventional multidisciplinary care improved significantly faster between 4 and 12 weeks (median change in Barthel Activities of Daily Living Index 6 versus 2; P<0.01) and had higher Quality of Life scores at 12 weeks (65 versus 59; P=0.07) and 6 months (72 versus 63; P<0.005). There were no significant differences in the mean duration of physiotherapy (42.8+/-41.2 versus 39.4+/-36.4 hours) or occupational therapy (8.5+/-7.5 versus 8.0+/-7.5 hours) received between the 2 groups.\n                ICP management offered no benefit over conventional multidisciplinary care on a stroke rehabilitation unit. Functional recovery was faster and Quality of Life outcomes better in patients receiving conventional multidisciplinary care.<doc-sep>The feasibility and efficacy of early discharge planning initiated by the admitting department in two acute care hospitals.<doc-sep>To determine the feasibility and efficacy of early discharge planning, initiated by admitting department personnel, a randomized, controlled trial was undertaken in 2 acute care, university-affiliated hospitals. The intervention tested was referral of patients by admitting personnel to nursing, social work, physiotherapy, occupational therapy, or dietary services for potential discharge planning. A 1-page, 65-item questionnaire was designed to identify patients for referral to the various allied health services. A copy of this was sent to the appropriate service, according to predefined criteria. The questionnaire took an average of 4 min to complete. The criteria used were highly predictive of length of stay, the most important being age, followed by living outside St. John's, admission within the previous 3 months, emergency admission, and being in need of community services. In Hospital A, the cases (n = 421) referred for early discharge planning had significantly shorter length of stay (Mantel-Cox, p = 0.03) than controls (n = 420), who were identical for all factors predictive of prolonged length of stay. The reduction in length of stay amounted to a mean of 0.8 d. In Hospital B (n = 758), the intervention was less effective because of a lower proportion of patients with factors associated with prolonged hospital stay and, perhaps, because of inadequate implementation of the program. We conclude that identification, by admitting department personnel, of patients who may benefit from early discharge planning is feasible. This process will reduce length of hospital stay, but its effectiveness is dependent on case mix variables and enthusiastic implementation of the program.<doc-sep>Redefining and redesigning hospital discharge to enhance patient care: a randomized controlled study.<doc-sep>Patients are routinely ill-prepared for the transition from hospital to home.

Outcomes of the intervention group were compared to concurrent and historical controls.\n                Only 25.5% of intervention patients had 1 or more undesirable outcomes compared to 55.1% of the concurrent and 55.0% of the historical controls. Notably, only 14.9% of the intervention patients failed to follow-up within 21 days compared to 40.8% of the concurrent and 35.0% of the historical controls. Only 11.5% of recommended outpatient workups in the intervention group were incomplete versus 31.3% in the concurrent and 31.0% in the historical controls.\n                A low-cost discharge-transfer intervention may improve the rates of outpatient follow-up and of completed workups after hospital discharge.<doc-sep>",

Separate sequential analyses (two-sided, alpha = 0.05, power = 0.95 to detect 85:15 advantage) were performed for mortality rates, air leaks, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, intraventricular hemorrhage, and assignment crossover, and a combined analysis was performed, with death overriding other outcome variables. Enrollment was completed when the combined analysis reached the sequential design boundary indicating no treatment difference. Mortality rates (19% among infants receiving high-frequency jet ventilation vs 24% among infants receiving conventional ventilation), the incidence of air leaks (48% vs 52%), bronchopulmonary dysplasia (39% vs 41%), and intraventricular hemorrhage (33% vs 43%), and assignment crossovers (14% vs 24%) did not differs significantly between the treatment groups. We conclude that early use of high-frequency jet ventilation does not prevent or substantially reduce mortality or morbidity rates associated with assisted ventilation.<doc-sep>Multicenter controlled clinical trial of high-frequency jet ventilation in preterm infants with uncomplicated respiratory distress syndrome.<doc-sep>To test the hypothesis that high-frequency jet ventilation (HFJV) will reduce the incidence and/or severity of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) and acute airleak in premature infants who, despite surfactant administration, require mechanical ventilation for respiratory distress syndrome.\n                Multicenter, randomized, controlled clinical trial of HFJV and conventional ventilation (CV). Patients were to remain on assigned therapy for 14 days or until extubation, whichever came first. Crossover from CV to HFJV was allowed if bilateral pulmonary interstitial emphysema or bronchopleural fistula developed. Patients could cross over to the other ventilatory mode if failure criteria were met. The optimal lung volume strategy was mandated for HFJV by protocol to provide alveolar recruitment and optimize lung volume and ventilation/perfusion matching, while minimizing pressure amplitude and O2 requirements. CV management was not controlled by protocol.\n                Eight tertiary neonatal intensive care units.\n                Preterm infants with birth weights between 700 and 1500 g and gestational age <36 weeks who required mechanical ventilation with FIO2 >0.30 at 2 to 12 hours after surfactant administration, received surfactant by 8 hours of age, were <20 hours old, and had been ventilated for <12 hours. Outcome Measures. Primary outcome variables were BPD at 28 days and 36 weeks of postconceptional age. Secondary outcome variables were survival, gas exchange, airway pressures, airleak, intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH), periventricular leukomalacia (PVL), and other nonpulmonary complications.\n                A total of 130 patients were included in the final analysis; 65 were randomized to HFJV and 65 to CV. The groups were of comparable birth weight, gestational age, severity of illness, postnatal age, and other demographics. The incidence of BPD at 36 weeks of postconceptional age was significantly lower in babies randomized to HFJV compared with CV (20.0% vs 40.4%). The need for home oxygen was also significantly lower in infants receiving HFJV compared with CV (5.5% vs 23.1%). Survival, incidence of BPD at 28 days, retinopathy of prematurity, airleak, pulmonary hemorrhage, grade I-II IVH, and other complications were similar. In retrospect, it was noted that the traditional HFJV strategy emphasizing low airway pressures (HF-LO) rather than the prescribed optimal volume strategy (HF-OPT) was used in 29/65 HFJV infants. This presented a unique opportunity to examine the effects of different HFJV strategies on gas exchange, airway pressures, and outcomes. HF-OPT was defined as increase in positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) by >/=1 cm H2O from pre-HFJV baseline and/or use of PEEP of >/=7 cm H2O. Severe neuroimaging abnormalities (PVL and/or grade III-IV IVH) were not different between the CV and HFJV infants. However, there was a significantly lower incidence of severe IVH/PVL in HFJV infants treated with HF-OPT compared with CV and HF-LO. Oxygenation was similar between CV and HFJV groups as a whole, but HF-OPT infants had better oxygenation compared with the other two groups. There were no differences in PaCO2 between CV and HFJV, but the PaCO2 was lower for HF-LO compared with the other two groups. The peak inspiratory pressure and DeltaP (peak inspiratory pressure-PEEP) were lower for HFJV infants compared with CV infants.\n                HFJV reduces the incidence of BPD at 36 weeks and the need for home oxygen in premature infants with uncomplicated RDS, but does not reduce the risk of acute airleak. There is no increase in adverse outcomes compared with CV. HF-OPT improves oxygenation, decreases exposure to hypocarbia, and reduces the risk of grade III-IV IVH and/or PVL.<doc-sep>High-frequency jet ventilation in the early management of respiratory distress syndrome is associated with a greater risk for adverse outcomes.<doc-sep>The objective of this investigation was to determine if high-frequency jet ventilation (HFJV) used early in the treatment of premature infants with respiratory distress syndrome was effective in reducing pulmonary morbidity without increasing the occurrence of adverse neurologic outcomes.\n                A total of 73 premature infants who met the inclusion criteria (gestational age of less than 33 weeks, birth weight of more than 500 g, age of less than 24 hours, need for assisted ventilation with peak inspiratory pressure of more than 16 and FIO2 more than 0.30, and roentgenographic evidence of respiratory distress syndrome) were randomized to either conventional (n = 36) or to high-frequency jet (n = 37) ventilation. Our goals were to maintain the infants on the assigned ventilator for at least 7 days unless they could either be extubated or meet crossover criteria. Univariate analyses were initially used to compare the two groups. Stepwise logistic regression was subsequently used to assess whether various factors independently influenced adverse outcomes.\n                The two groups of infants were similar in all obstetrical, perinatal, and neonatal demographic characteristics. The mean birth weight and gestational age in the conventional group were 930 g and 26.6 weeks and in the HFJV group, 961 g and 26.9 weeks. The infants were randomized at similar ages (7.1 and 7.3 hours of life, respectively). Their prerandomization ventilator settings and arterial blood gases were nearly identical. There were no differences in pulmonary outcomes (occurrence of air leaks, need for oxygen or ventilation at 36 weeks postconception), and there were no differences in the mean number of days oxygen was required, number of days ventilated, or length of hospital stay. Infants ventilated with HFJV were significantly more likely to develop cystic periventricular leukomalacia (10 vs 2, P = .022) or to have a poor outcome (grade IV hemorrhage, cystic periventricular leukomalacia, or death) (17 vs 7, P = .016). Logistic regression analysis revealed HFJV to be a significant independent predictor of both cystic periventricular leukomalacia and a poor outcome. The presence of hypocarbia was not an independently significant predictor of adverse outcomes.\n                With the HFJV treatment strategy that we used, use of the high-frequency jet ventilator in the early management of premature infants with respiratory distress syndrome resulted in significantly more adverse outcomes than in those treated with conventional mechanical ventilation.<doc-sep>",

An adequate response was defined as elevation of Hb > or = 120 g/l. Relevant clinical and laboratory assessments were made to evaluate efficacy and secure safety. A significant elevation in Hb from week 10 onwards was noted in twenty-six patients (five drop-outs) out of nine patients receiving placebo (one drop-out) (12 +/- 1.2 g/l vs 4 +/- 0.5 g/l; Hb elevation from 95 g/l to 107 g/l vs 93 g/l to 97 g/l, P < 0.05). Only 14.6%, however, were considered responders according to preset criteria. In the responders a lower initial CRP, a significant reduction in ESR but not in CRP was seen compared to the remaining r-HuEPO group. A significant elevation of energy level was noted in the r-HuEPO group; otherwise, no differences in clinical variables were seen. No serious adverse effects were noted. When analyzing patients receiving oral iron in combination with r-HuEPO and adding five additional, openly selected patients receiving both adequate iron supplementation and r-HuEPO, there was a significant weekly elevation of Hb from week 8 onwards in favor of combination therapy over the ones only receiving r-HuEPO (18 +/- 1.1 g/l vs 7 +/- 1.1 g/l, P < 0.05). The initial six responders had now reached ten of whom seven belonged to the combination therapy group. Response to r-HuEPO in RA patients appears to be dependent on availability of iron and on the degree of inflammation.

In the common classical form of homeopathy, prescriptions are individualised for each patient. There has been no rigorous investigation into this form of treatment for asthma.\n                In a randomised, double blind, placebo controlled trial the effects of individualised homeopathic remedies were compared with placebo medication in 96 children with mild to moderate asthma as an adjunct to conventional treatment. The main outcome measure was the active quality of living subscale of the Childhood Asthma Questionnaire administered at baseline and follow up at 12 months. Other outcome measures included other subscales of the same questionnaire, peak flow rates, use of medication, symptom scores, days off school, asthma events, global assessment of change, and adverse reactions.\n                There were no clinically relevant or statistically significant changes in the active quality of life score. Other subscales, notably those measuring severity, indicated relative improvements but the sizes of the effects were small. There were no differences between the groups for other measures.\n                This study provides no evidence that adjunctive homeopathic remedies, as prescribed by experienced homeopathic practitioners, are superior to placebo in improving the quality of life of children with mild to moderate asthma in addition to conventional treatment in primary care.<doc-sep>",

Eleven babies, 6 in the control group and 5 in the treatment group, were withdrawn from the trial due to early death from extreme prematurity (7 babies), early return to the referring hospital (3 babies), and elective treatment with intravenous immunoglobulin for severe congenital septicaemia (1 baby). Of the 55 who remained in the trial, significantly fewer babies in the treatment group had infection, 8 compared to 17 (p = 0.01). This difference was not significant when blood-culture-proven septicaemia only was considered, 8 compared to 14 (p = 0.09). Twenty-seven (84%) of 32 blood-culture-positive episodes of infection were caused by coagulase-negative staphylococci. Serum IgG was significantly higher with treatment and achieved levels comparable to those of normal full-term babies at the same post-natal age.<doc-sep>A controlled trial of intravenous immune globulin to reduce nosocomial infections in very-low-birth-weight infants. National Institute of Child Health and Human Development Neonatal Research Network.<doc-sep>Nosocomial infections are a major cause of morbidity and mortality in premature infants. As a rule, their low serum gamma globulin levels at birth subsequently decline to hypogammaglobulinemic values; hence, prophylactic administration of intravenous immune globulin may reduce the rate of hospital-acquired infections.\n                In this prospective, multicenter, two-phase controlled trial, 2416 infants were stratified according to birth weight (501 to 1000 g and 1001 to 1500 g) and randomly assigned to an intravenous immune globulin group (n = 1204) or a control group (n = 1212). Control infants were given placebo infusions during phase 1 of the study (n = 623) but were not given any infusions during phase 2 (n = 589). Infants weighing 501 to 1000 g at birth were given 900 mg of immune globulin per kilogram of body weight, and infants weighing 1001 to 1500 g at birth were given a dose of 700 mg per kilogram. The immune globulin infusions were repeated every 14 days until the infants weighed 1800 g, were transferred to another center, died, or were sent home from the hospital.\n                Nosocomial infections of the blood, meninges, or urinary tract occurred in 439 of the 2416 infants (18.2 percent): 208 (17.3 percent) in the immune globulin group and 231 (19.1 percent) in the control group (relative risk, 0.91; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.77 to 1.08). Septicemia occurred in 15.5 percent of the immune globulin recipients and 17.2 percent of the controls. During phase 1 the rate of nosocomial infections was 13.4 percent in the immune globulin group and 17.8 percent in the control group; the respective rates during phase 2 were 21.0 percent and 20.4 percent. The predominant organisms included gram-positive cocci (53.0 percent), gram-negative bacilli (22.4 percent), and candida species (16.0 percent). Adverse reactions were rarely observed during the infusions. Immune globulin therapy had no effect on respiratory distress syndrome, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, intracranial hemorrhage, the duration of hospitalization, or mortality. The incidence of necrotizing enterocolitis was 12.0 percent in the immune globulin group and 9.5 percent in the control group.\n                Prophylactic use of intravenous immune globulin failed to reduce the incidence of hospital-acquired infections in very-low-birth-weight infants.<doc-sep>The use of prophylactic intravenous immunoglobulin therapy in very low birthweight infants.<doc-sep>Nosocomial infections are a major cause of death in premature infants, especially in very low birthweight (VLBW) infants. The VLBW infants have low serum immunoglobulin G levels, which may have an effect on infections in early infancy. Thus, prophylactic administration of intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) is proposed to maintain higher immunoglobulin G and reduce the rate of hospital-acquired infection.\n                A study for the effects of prophylactic IVIG therapy in VLBW infants was performed. A total of 61 VLBW infants were enrolled, and divided into the IVIG group (n = 31) and the control group (n = 30). The dose for each infant was 750-1000 mg/kg for those whose birthweight was less than 1000 g, and 500-750 mg/kg for infants whose birthweight was between 1001 and 1500 g. The control group received saline infusion. The infusions were given every 2 weeks until the infant weighed 1800 g, or was discharged.\n                The results showed: there were no major differences in the perinatal and neonatal characteristics between the two groups, consistently higher IgG levels were found in the IVIG group, and the age of first documented sepsis was earlier in the control group.\n                In this study, the prophylactic IVIG therapy may give substantially higher IgG levels, which may last for 2 months. However, a prophylactic effect for hospital-acquired infections was not observed.<doc-sep>Intravenous immunoglobulin for prevention of sepsis in preterm and low birth weight infants.<doc-sep>The effect of an intravenous polyvalent immunoglobulin preparation given prophylactically to prevent neonatal sepsis was tested in preterm and low birth weight infants. Infants matched for gestational age, sex and birth weight (+/- 250 g) were randomly allocated into 3 groups of 50 each, one group (Group C) being used as control. Group A received Intraglobulin (Biotest Pharma, West Germany), 120 mg/kg intravenously, within 2 to 4 hours of delivery; Group B received the same on days 1 and 8. The control group received no immunoglobulin. The frequency of infection and serum immunoglobulin concentrations were determined in each group. Infection rate in the control group was 16% (8 of 50) while in each of the treated groups it was 4% (2 of 50) (P less than 0.005). The immunoglobulin concentrations achieved in the treated group were significantly higher than the control group. No adverse effect of the therapy was noted during the study and at a 6-month follow-up. It is suggested that in nurseries where the infection rate is high, prophylactic intravenous polyvalent immunoglobulin therapy for the preterm and low birth weight infants may provide protection from infection.<doc-sep>Intravenous immune globulin for the prevention of nosocomial infection in low-birth-weight neonates. The Multicenter Group for the Study of Immune Globulin in Neonates.<doc-sep>Nosocomial infection is a major risk for premature infants with very low birth weights. One reason for their susceptibility to infection may be antibody deficiency, since there is little transfer of maternal IgG to the fetus before 32 weeks' gestation.\n                We conducted a multicenter, double-blind study of neonates weighing 500 to 1750 g at birth. A total of 588 neonates were randomly assigned, with stratification for birth weight, to receive periodic intravenous infusions of either immune globulin (500 mg per kilogram of body weight per day) or a placebo. Mortality, morbidity, and nosocomial infection during the next 56 days were assessed.\n                The infusions were well tolerated; mild, reversible adverse reactions occurred in five infants in each group. There was a significant reduction in the risk of a first nosocomial infection in the recipients of immune globulin as compared with the placebo recipients (relative risk, 0.7; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.5 to 0.9). About 85 percent of the nosocomial infections were bacterial; the majority of these were caused by coagulase-negative staphylococci or Staphylococcus aureus. The neonates who received immune globulin had fewer mean days of hospitalization than the controls (62 vs. 68, P = 0.15); among the infants with infections, the difference in the mean length of the hospital stay was even greater (80 days vs. 101 days, P = 0.02).\n                For premature infants weighing between 500 and 1750 g at birth, treatment with intravenous infusions of immune globulin is safe and reduces the risk of nosocomial infection.<doc-sep>Intravenous gammaglobulin in the prophylaxis of late sepsis in very-low-birth-weight infants: preliminary results of a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial.<doc-sep>The efficacy of intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) as prophylaxis for late sepsis was evaluated in a placebo-controlled, randomized, double-blind trial involving 240 infants of very low birth weight (less than 1,300 g). Each infant received a total of five doses of either IVIG (1 g/d) or an albumin placebo. The first four doses were administered between days 1 and 5 of life, and the last dose was administered on day 15 or shortly thereafter. Preliminary analysis of data available for 126 patients showed that in the first 30 days, sepsis developed in nine of 61 patients given IVIG and in 16 of 65 given placebo (one-tailed P = .065). At 70 days, the number who developed sepsis was similar in the two groups: 20 for those who received IVIG vs. 23 for those who received placebo. When patients with coagulase-negative staphylococcal infections were deleted from the totals, the results were essentially the same, i.e., three of 61 who received IVIG vs. nine of 65 who received placebo (one-tailed P = .041), developed sepsis during the first 30 days and 12 of 61 vs. 13 of 65, respectively, had developed sepsis at 70 days. In the IVIG group, the median peak level of serum IgG at day 7 was 1,700 mg/dL and the IgG levels were significantly greater than those in the placebo group for days 7-42. These data suggest that infusions of IVIG at the doses and dosing intervals used in this study may be effective in decreasing the incidence of late-onset sepsis during the first month of life in infants of very low birth weight.<doc-sep>A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled investigation of the safety of intravenous immune globulin administration to preterm neonates.<doc-sep>Intravenous immune globulin (750 mg/kg), or an equivalent volume of a placebo, was administered during the first week of life, in a randomized trial, to 20 preterm neonates weighing 710 to 1800 g. A variety of laboratory and clinical values were measured serially and analyzed for possible untoward effects. Serum IgG levels were also determined serially. No differences in heart rate, respiratory rate, urine output, blood glucose, serum osmolality, BUN, SGPT, pH, blood gasses, serum electrolytes, total or direct bilirubin, blood leukocyte concentration, absolute neutrophil count, or blood platelet concentration were observed between the intravenous immune globulin (IVIG) and placebo recipients before or following IVIG administration. The red blood cell concentration of IVIG recipients diminished transiently and only slightly (P less than .05). Serum IgG levels increased from 503 +/- 162 mg/dL (X +/- SD) to 1492 +/- 201 mg/dL 15 minutes after the IVIG administration (P less than .001). After 8 days, serum IgG levels were still elevated, at 675 +/- 297 mg/dL. All patients randomized to receive the placebo experienced a diminution in serum IgG over this 8-day period (P less than .01). All 20 patients survived and none in either group had a documented nosocomial infection. This study suggests that IVIG can safely be administered to preterm neonates, resulting in serum IgG levels comparable to those of term infants.<doc-sep>Intravenous gammaglobulin therapy for prophylaxis of infection in high-risk neonates.<doc-sep>The safety and effectiveness of intravenously administered gammaglobulin therapy for prophylaxis of infection was evaluated in 133 high-risk neonates. The infants were stratified into two groups: infants with birth weight less than or equal to 1500 g and gestational age less than or equal to 34 weeks, and infants with birth weight greater than 1500 g and receiving intensive care and assisted ventilation. Forty-three infants in group 1 and 25 in group 2 were given gammaglobulin at a dose of 0.5 g/kg/wk, for 1 month in group 1 and during intensive care in group 2. Forty infants in group 1 and 25 in group 2 served as controls. Serum total IgG and group B streptococcus-, Escherichia coli-, and CMV-specific IgG levels similar to those in adult controls were observed in the treated infants 2 hours after gammaglobulin administration. In the treated infants in group 1, the incidence of infection was 51%, and of septicemia 5%; in the controls the incidence of infection was 77% (P less than 0.02), and of septicemia 20% (P less than 0.05). Infection was the main cause of death in one treated and six control infants in group 1 (P less than 0.04). In the infants with birth weight greater than 1500 g receiving intensive care and assisted ventilation, no significant differences were observed in the incidence of infection or septicemia in treated and control infants. No side effects were observed after intravenous gammaglobulin administration. These data show that intravenously administered gammaglobulin is both safe and effective for prophylaxis of infection in preterm very low birth weight infants.<doc-sep>Use of intravenously administered immune globulin to prevent nosocomial sepsis in low birth weight infants: report of a pilot study.<doc-sep>To evaluate the use of intravenously administered immune globulin (IVIG) for prevention of sepsis in preterm infants, we administered IVIG in a protocol designed to maintain a therapeutic serum \"target level\" of 700 mg/dl. The 200 patients who were eligible for the study (600 to 2000 gm birth weight) were monitored throughout their initial hospitalization. Of these, 115 patients were randomly assigned in a double-blind, controlled trial to treatment and placebo groups. The remaining 85 infants were not randomly assigned to a group, by parental request, but were followed and analyzed separately. In one patient who received IVIG, transient tachycardia and a decrease in blood pressure developed during an infusion; resolution occurred promptly after the infusion was discontinued. No persistent hepatic or renal abnormalities were noted in either the IVIG- or the placebo-treated group. There were seven episodes of sepsis in the placebo group and nine in the group whose parents refused consent to the study. No infant who received IVIG acquired nosocomial sepsis (p less than 0.01). All patients in the placebo group in whom sepsis developed had serum IgG levels less than 400 mg/dl at the time sepsis developed. Serum IgG levels were maintained near 700 mg/dl in patients who received IVIG. These data indicate that administration of sufficient IVIG to maintain target serum IgG levels throughout hospitalization may decrease the incidence of nosocomial sepsis in preterm infants.<doc-sep>Intravenous immunoglobulin for prophylaxis of nosocomial sepsis.<doc-sep>A total of 76 premature newborn infants with gestational age of 34 weeks or less were enrolled in a randomized controlled study to determine whether intravenously administrated immunoglobulin (IVIG) is able to prevent nosocomial sepsis. Forty infants were given 0.5 g/kg IVIG on the first day of life and 36 infants with similar gestational age and birth weight were selected as controls and did not receive IVIG. The frequency of proven sepsis, with a positive blood and/or cerebrospinal fluid culture, was significantly lower in infants who received IVIG as compared to controls (42.5 vs 80.0%) (p < 0.01). The mortality rate attributable to infection was not different in IVIG recipients and in controls (41 vs 48%) (p > 0.05). The overall mortality rates in the two groups were not different either (35.0 vs 44.4%) (p > 0.05). The majority of micro-organisms isolated from the blood culture of the patients were gram negative microorganisms (Klebsiella, Enterobacter). IVIG therapy was believed to be effective for prophylaxis of nosocomial infection, but such therapy was not able to reduce overall mortality rate or mortality rate due to systemic infection in prematurely born infants in our intensive care unit where the causative pathogens are usually gram negative microorganisms.<doc-sep>Intravenous immunoglobulin therapy for prevention of infection in high-risk premature infants: report of a multicenter, double-blind study.<doc-sep>The effectiveness of intravenously administered immunoglobulin (Ig) therapy for prophylaxis of infection was evaluated in high-risk preterm infants.

Thirty infants (25%) of the Ig group and 18 (16%) of the placebo group had one or more episodes of probable infection. No significant differences were observed in the incidence of certain or probable infection in treated and control infants. Nevertheless, among the infants who had one or more certain or probable episodes of infection, more of them belonged to the Ig group than to the placebo group. The possible deleterious effect of the administration of large amounts of polyspecific Ig is discussed.<doc-sep>Intravenous immunoglobulin for prophylaxis of neonatal sepsis in premature infants.<doc-sep>The incidence of sepsis, mortality due to sepsis, total mortality, and minor infections was evaluated in a group of 46 premature newborn infants who were treated with intravenous immunoglobulins.

Infants were randomly allocated into 3 groups of 35 each. Group I and group II received 250 mg/kg and 500 mg/kg of immunoglobulin intravenously respectively within four hours of life. Group III was not given immunoglobulin and served as the control group. It was found that during the early neonatal period the infection rate of group I (14.7%) and group II (14.7%) was significantly lower than that of group III (38.2%). There was no difference in the infection rate of group I and group II. The mortality rate was also higher in group III than in group I and group II. It suggested that the intravenous immunoglobulin dosage of 250 mg per kilogram body weight is effective as well as dosage of 500 mg per kilogram body weight in prevention of sepsis in very low birth weight infants during the early neonatal period.<doc-sep>The use of intravenously administered immunoglobulins in the prevention of severe infection in very low birth weight neonates.<doc-sep>In a randomized prospective study in 116 selected neonates with very low birth weight, the effect of standard doses of intravenously administered immunoglobulins (IVIG) on the occurrence of severe infections was studied. No difference in infection rate or severity of infection could be observed between the treated neonates and the control group. The lack of effect could not be explained by an insufficient increase in the IgG serum levels, or inversely, by high immunosuppressive IgG levels. It is concluded that in very low birth weight neonates the administration of IVIG, under the conditions used in this investigation, does not protect against severe infection.<doc-sep>Intravenous immunoglobulin for sepsis prevention in preterm infants.<doc-sep>The aim of this study was to investigate whether intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) can prevent sepsis in premature newborn infants. The study group consisted of 80 preterm newborn infants, who were divided into two groups: 40 preterm newborns received IVIG prophylactically (group A) and the control group (group B, n = 40) did not receive IVIG. IVIG was given at a dose of 500 mg/kg to infants. weighing greater than 1500 g, and 700 mg/kg to those weighing less than 1500 g at birth on days one, two and eight of life. By two, eight and 12 days of age, the treatment group had significantly greater IgG concentrations than the control group. Mortality was 7.5 percent (3/40) in group A and 27.5 percent (11/40) in group B (p < 0.01). Bacteremia was determined in three blood cultures in group A and eight in group B, particularly S.aureus and S.enteritis.<doc-sep>The use of intravenous gamma-globulin for prevention of sepsis in pre-term infants. A controlled clinical trial.<doc-sep>This paper reports a randomized clinical trial to study the effect of an intravenous gamma-globulin preparation to prevent sepsis in pre-term newborn infants. 80 infants were enrolled: 37 of birthweight less than or equal to 1500 g and 43 of birthweight 1501-2000 g. In each group 20 infants received an intravenous preparation of gamma-globulin (0.5 g/kg/wk); the remaining 17 and 20, respectively, served as control cases. No significant differences in the occurrence of sepsis were observed between the group receiving prophylactively intravenous gamma-globulin and the control group. This is particularly evident in infants under intensive care (35% of the total population): in this group 2/3 of sepsis occurred in infants who received IgG. Among the infants with sepsis, the presence of an umbilical artery catheterization represented a significant risk-factor. The post-dose increment of serum IgG did not differ significantly in infants with and without sepsis; the post-dose serum disappearance rate in concentration appears identical in the two groups.<doc-sep>Intravenous immune globulin prophylaxis of late-onset sepsis in premature neonates.<doc-sep>To determine whether a single dose of intravenously administered immune globulin (IVIG) decreases late-onset sepsis in premature infants, we prospectively entered 753 neonates with birth weight 500 to 2000 gm, gestation < or = 34 weeks, and age < or = 12 hours into a multicenter, double-blind, controlled trial. Infants were randomly selected to receive a single intravenous infusion, 10 ml/kg, of either IVIG (500 mg/kg) or albumin (5 mg/kg) and were observed for 8 weeks for infection. Maternal and neonatal risk factors for infection did not differ between groups. Although serum IgG values before infusion were related to gestation (R = 0.62), the change in serum IgG or half-life of IgG after IVIG infusion was not (R < or = 0.09). The serum IgG concentration was increased (p < 0.05) in IVIG-treated patients for 8 weeks. There were 88 episodes of late-onset sepsis in 79 neonates (10.5%). Causative organisms included the following: Staphylococcus epidermidis (37 episodes), Enterococcus (9), Staphylococcus aureus (7), Candida (6), Escherichia coli (6), and multiple organisms (11). Sepsis, death, and death as a result of infection were unaffected by treatment. We conclude that a single infusion of IVIG, 500 mg/kg, shortly after birth was not effective prophylaxis for late-onset infection in premature neonates. Future studies of late-onset sepsis prophylaxis should consider IVIG with known pathogen-specific antibody concentrations against organisms causing these infections, in particular S. epidermidis.<doc-sep>",

Moderators of the effects of written emotional disclosure in a randomized trial among women with chronic pelvic pain.<doc-sep>Although written emotional disclosure has potential as a stress management intervention for people with health problems, the main (group) effects of disclosure in medical populations are limited. This study sought to identify individual difference moderators of the effects of written disclosure among women with chronic pelvic pain.\n                In a prospective, randomized trial, 48 women with chronic pelvic pain completed 3 individual difference measures and then wrote for 3 days about stressful consequences of their pain (disclosure) or positive events (control). Health status was assessed at baseline and 2 months after writing.\n                Main effect group comparisons indicated that disclosure writing resulted in significantly lower evaluative pain intensity ratings than control writing at follow-up, but there were no main effects on other outcome variables (sensory or affective pain, disability, affect). Three baseline individual difference measures, however, significantly moderated group effects. Compared with control writing, disclosure led to less disability among women with higher baseline ambivalence over emotional expression or higher catastrophizing, and to increased positive affect among women with higher baseline negative affect. Ambivalence, but not catastrophizing, was independent of negative affect in its moderation effect.\n                Although the main effects of writing about the stress of pelvic pain are limited, women with higher baseline ambivalence about emotional expression or negative affect appear to respond more positively to this intervention.<doc-sep>A randomized clinical trial to compare two different approaches in women with chronic pelvic pain.<doc-sep>One hundred six patients with chronic pelvic pain were randomly allocated to one of two treatment groups. In the standard-approach group, organic causes of pelvic pain were excluded first and diagnostic laparoscopy was routinely performed. If no somatic cause could be found, attention was given to other causes such as psychological disturbances. In the second group an integrated approach was chosen. From the beginning equal attention was devoted to somatic, psychological, dietary, environmental, and physiotherapeutic factors. In this group, laparoscopy was not routinely performed. Both groups were similar with respect to clinical characteristics of the patients and the severity of their pain as assessed by various pain parameters. Postcoital pain was reported by 27% of the patients. Twenty percent of the patients had had negative sexual experiences such as childhood sexual abuse or rape. Evaluation of the pain 1 year after the institution of treatment revealed that the integrated approach improved pelvic pain significantly more often than the standard approach for three out of four pain parameters (P less than .01). Laparoscopy played no important role in the treatment of pelvic pain. It is concluded that equal attention to both organic and other causative factors from the beginning of therapy is more likely to result in a reduction of pelvic pain than is a standard approach.<doc-sep>Randomized placebo controlled trial of lofexidine hydrochloride for chronic pelvic pain in women.<doc-sep>We hypothesised that the orally-active alpha(2)-adrenoceptor agonist lofexidine hydrochloride would ameliorate chronic pelvic pain in women.\n                A randomized placebo-controlled parallel group trial was undertaken in the University Hospital Gynaecology Clinic. Women with pelvic pain of at least 6 months duration were eligible, and were randomized using a sealed envelope system to receive up to 600 mg lofexidine hydrochloride twice daily over 8 weeks or placebo. Outcome measures were summary and daily diary visual analog scales for pain (VAS) and a 5 point self rating scale.\n                9/19 women randomized to lofexidine completed the study compared to 14/20 of those randomized to placebo. Intention-to-treat analysis showed that 4/19 in the lofexidine group achieved 50% or greater reduction in VAS compared with 8/20 in the placebo group (OR 2.5, 95% CI 0.6--10.3).

If adhesions were confirmed during diagnostic laparoscopy, patients were randomly assigned either to laparoscopic adhesiolysis or no treatment. Treatment allocation was concealed from patients, and assessors were unaware of patients' treatment and outcome. Pain was assessed for 1 year by visual analogue score (VAS) score (scale 0-100), pain change score, use of analgesics, and quality of life score. Analysis was by intention to treat.\n                Of 116 patients enrolled for diagnostic laparoscopy, 100 were randomly allocated either laparoscopic adhesiolysis (52) or no treatment (48). Both groups reported substantial pain relief and a significantly improved quality of life, but there was no difference between the groups (mean change from baseline of VAS score at 12 months: difference 3 points, p=0.53; 95% CI -7 to 13).\n                Although laparoscopic adhesiolysis relieves chronic abdominal pain, it is not more beneficial than diagnostic laparoscopy alone.

The effect of the drug on pain relief was assessed by a single-blind crossover trial with intravenous saline as the placebo and by a visual analogue scale to assess the intensity of pain. Pain was significantly lower post-DHE 4 and 8 h and 2 and 4 days after treatment than after placebo.

Eighty-four women with abnormal pelvic venography were assigned to one of four treatment groups: MPA alone, MPA plus psychotherapy, placebo alone, and placebo plus psychotherapy. Women were treated for 4 months and thereafter followed up regularly for 9 months with pain assessments, pelvic ultrasound scanning, and hormone measurements. During treatment, MPA showed a significant benefit in terms of a reduction in visual analogue scale pain score, with 73% of women reporting at least 50% improvement compared with 33% of those treated with placebo. At 9 months after the end of therapy there was no overall significant effect of MPA or psychotherapy, but there was an interaction between MPA and psychotherapy, with 71% of the women in this group showing a greater than or equal to 50% reduction in pain score.

Patients received either goserelin acetate (3.6 mg/month for 6 months) or medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA; 30 mg/day for 6 months). Among patients with chronic pelvic pain, those with pure pelvic congestion were mostly parous, had the most severe pelvic signs and symptom scores, lowest rates of sexual functioning, and higher states of anxiety and depression as compared with others. At 1 year after treatment, goserelin remained superior to MPA in terms of pelvic venographic improvement as an objective measure. In alleviation of signs and symptomatology, improvement of sexual functioning and reduction of anxiety and depressive states as subjective measures, goserelin acetate achieved a statistically significant advantage (P = 0.0001) compared with MPA.<doc-sep>A randomized clinical trial on the benefit of adhesiolysis in patients with intraperitoneal adhesions and chronic pelvic pain.<doc-sep>To see whether surgical adhesiolysis would improve pelvic pain in women with pelvic adhesions.\n                Randomized clinical trial comparing surgery (adhesiolysis) with no surgery with final analysis of results after 9-12 months.\n                Department of Gynecology, Leiden University Medical Center, the Netherlands.\n                48 women known by laparoscopy to have stage II-IV pelvic adhesions.\n                Midline laparotomy and surgical adhesiolysis.\n                Pelvic pain assessed by the McGill pain score, subjective pain assessment and disturbance of daily activities.\n                24 women were randomly allocated to undergo surgical adhesiolysis and 24 to a control group who did not have surgery.

         "The range of proven effective interventions for chronic pelvic pain remains limited and recommendations are based largely on single studies. Given the prevalence and healthcare costs associated with chronic pelvic pain in women, randomised controlled trials of other medical, surgical and psychological interventions are urgently required.Chronic pelvic pain is common in women in the reproductive and older age groups and it causes disability and distress that result in significant costs to health services. The pathogenesis of chronic pelvic pain is poorly understood. Often investigation by laparoscopy reveals no obvious cause for the pain. There are several possible explanations for chronic pelvic pain including undetected irritable bowel syndrome, and central sensitisation of the nervous system. A vascular hypothesis proposes that pain arises from dilated pelvic veins in which blood flow is markedly reduced. As the pathophysiology of chronic pelvic pain is not well understood, its treatment is often unsatisfactory and limited to symptom relief. Currently the main approaches to treatment include counselling or psychotherapy, attempts to provide reassurance using laparoscopy to exclude serious pathology, progestogen therapy such as with medroxyprogesterone acetate and surgery to interrupt nerve pathways.",

         "Short term effect of methotrexate in severe steroid-dependent asthma.<doc-sep>The steroid-sparing capacity of methotrexate in asthmatics is still being debated. The present study was undertaken to evaluate the effect of low-dose methotrexate on steroid consumption in patients with severe asthma, who require very high doses of systemic corticosteroids. We conducted a randomized, double-blind, parallel clinical trial in 24 patients with long-standing asthma. After a 3-week run-in period, patients received a 16-week course of either 15 mg of oral methotrexate weekly or matched placebo in addition to their previous asthma therapy. The daily steroid dose (at run-in 30 +/- 14 mg/day in the methotrexate group; 25 +/- 9 mg/day in the placebo group (NS)) decreased by 24% in the methotrexate group (p < 0.01) and by 5% in the placebo group (NS) during weeks 9-16 of the treatment period when compared with run-in values. However, there was no difference in steroid consumption between the two groups at any time. We conclude that in patients with severe asthma who require very high doses of systemic corticosteroids, short-term treatment with methotrexate allows only a marginal steroid reduction. Our study does not support the use of methotrexate as a steroid-sparing agent in asthmatics.<doc-sep>Methotrexate in the treatment of steroid-dependent asthma.<doc-sep>A double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study was designed to compare steroid requirements between placebo and methotrexate (MTX) treatment in subjects with corticosteroid-requiring asthma. Subjects began with a steroid taper and then were randomized to a 3-month trial of drug or placebo therapy. Subjects received 15 mg of MTX a week or identical placebo. A 1-month washout period was completed before the crossover trial. Symptom scores, peak flow rates, spirometry, and beta-agonist frequency were closely monitored. Ten subjects completed the study. The average dose of prednisone during the placebo-treatment period was 11.97 mg/day compared to 8.37 mg/day while subjects were taking MTX. This was a 30% reduction in daily steroid requirement (p less than 0.01). Symptom scores and spirometry did not differ between the crossover trials, and overall clinical status was not altered. Complications from MTX were mild and included anorexia, alopecia, and stomatitis. All complications resolved with dose reduction or when MTX was stopped at the end of the study. No subjects withdrew from the study because of MTX complications. Low-dose MTX significantly reduced the steroid requirement in this group of subjects with steroid-dependent asthma. This reduction in steroid requirement was obtained without altering clinical status and without significant complication.<doc-sep>Controlled trial of methotrexate in patients with severe chronic asthma.<doc-sep>The aim of this study was to investigate the efficacy and adverse effects of methotrexate (MTX) in the treatment of severe chronic asthma in 12 patients with severe asthma requiring continuous treatment with oral steroids at the Outpatient Department of Helsinki University Central Hospital. The study was a randomised, double-blind placebo-controlled trial of methotrexate treatment 15 mg weekly on a crossover basis over 24 weeks. During the 2 weeks baseline phase the mean dose of oral steroids administered was 10.9 (3.2-28) mg.day-1, and the mean dose of inhaled steroids administered was 2.3 (1.6-3.2) mg budesonide or beclomethasone. The average dose of oral steroids administered was 12.8 mg.day-1 during the last 2 placebo weeks but only 7.9 mg.day-1 during the last 2 weeks with MTX treatment. The reduction in daily dose of oral steroids was 38%, while daily bronchodilator use was reduced by 22%. During MTX treatment the patients experienced significantly less wheezing, dyspnoea and coughing. Nine out of 12 patients reported better asthma control during MTX treatment. The peak expiratory flow rate (PEF) 1-s forced expiratory volume (FEV1) values did not differ between MTX and placebo treatments. There was no statistical correlation between serum MTX concentration and clinical improvement. No serious adverse effects of MTX were found during the study. It was concluded that low-dose MTX may be beneficial for severe chronic asthma and that this therapy is well tolerated by patients.<doc-sep>Lack of benefit of methotrexate in severe, steroid-dependent asthma. A double-blind, placebo-controlled study.<doc-sep>To determine the effect of low-dose methotrexate in asthmatic patients on steroid use, asthma symptom scores, pulmonary function, airway reactivity, blood cellular components, and immunoglobulin E levels.\n                A randomized, double-blind, parallel, placebo-controlled, 13-week clinical trial with follow-up of patients in an open trial of methotrexate at the conclusion of the double-blind study.\n                An asthma care outpatient clinic.\n                From February 1988 to March 1990, 19 patients with severe, steroid-dependent asthma were enrolled in the study. Two of these patients were excluded from analysis.\n                Patients were administered methotrexate or placebo intramuscularly, to assure complete absorption, once weekly during the 13-week study.\n                Patients on methotrexate and placebo both significantly decreased their steroid dose by 39.6% (95% CI, 25.1% to 54.1%, P = 0.001) and 40.2% (CI, 17.9% to 67.4%, P = 0.003), respectively. Pulmonary function did not differ significantly between the methotrexate and placebo groups. In addition, airway reactivity and symptom scores were unchanged on methotrexate or placebo. No significant toxicities were seen during the course of the 13-week blinded study, but one patient on methotrexate and prednisone in the follow-up period developed Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia and died. Despite continuing methotrexate for up to 1 year, and increasing methotrexate to 30 mg weekly, no significant benefit of methotrexate on asthma control could be shown.\n                Our study does not support the use of methotrexate in the treatment of severe asthma.<doc-sep>Comparison of oral pulse methotrexate with placebo in the treatment of severe glucocorticosteroid-dependent asthma.<doc-sep>This study compared the efficacy of weekly oral administration of methotrexate and placebo in treatment of 24 subjects with chronic glucocorticosteroid-dependent asthma.\n                The 33-week randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover trial compared once weekly 15 mg doses of methotrexate with placebo. At the time of entry, the subjects' mean dosage of prednisone was 23.8 mg/day (range, 12.5 to 85 mg) and glucocorticosteroid therapy had been used continuously for a mean duration of 78 months (range, 5 to 360 months).\n                Of the 21 subjects who completed the study, 13 tolerated lower daily prednisone doses during methotrexate treatment compared with placebo. When treated with methotrexate, subjects required 14.2% less prednisone than when treated with placebo (p = 0.0447), their subjective symptom scores improved 21.4% (p < 0.05), and mean forced expiratory volume in 1 second values tended to improve. Mean serum theophylline levels did not change significantly between the methotrexate and placebo arms of the study. Adverse effects were minimal, with nausea and headache occurring twice as often during methotrexate therapy compared with placebo.\n                Short-term, low-dose, pulse therapy with orally administered methotrexate results in a decrease in the daily glucocorticosteroid requirement in a majority of subjects with severe asthma and is accompanied by improvement in subjective symptom scores without unacceptable side effects or deterioration of pulmonary function.<doc-sep>Methotrexate in the treatment of corticosteroid-dependent asthma. A double-blind crossover study.<doc-sep>To test our previous observation that methotrexate reduces corticosteroid requirements of patients with severe asthma, we studied 14 patients with corticosteroid-dependent bronchial asthma in a 24-week randomized double-blind crossover trial comparing a low dosage of methotrexate (15 mg per week) with placebo. At base line the mean dosage of prednisone was 173.5 mg per week (range, 70 to 420). On the average, 36.5 percent less prednisone was required when patients received methotrexate than when they received placebo (P = 0.01). Measurement of forced vital capacity and forced expiratory volume in one second showed that there was no deterioration in the condition of patients in whom the dosage of prednisone was reduced. The patients' subjective assessment of breathing ability indicated significant improvement (P = 0.01). The adverse effects of methotrexate were limited to transient nausea in three patients and an evanescent rash in one patient. Nine patients are still receiving methotrexate 3 to 10 months after the study's conclusion. The dosages of steroids have been further reduced in each of these patients, and prednisone has been discontinued in four. We conclude from this preliminary study that the use of methotrexate allows a significant reduction in the use of corticosteroids in patients with severe asthma without deterioration of pulmonary function.<doc-sep>Randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of methotrexate in steroid-dependent asthma.<doc-sep>69 patients with steroid-dependent asthma (mean daily prednisolone dose 14.2 [SD 6.1] mg) took part in a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of 24 weeks' treatment with methotrexate 15 mg weekly. The patients were seen every 4 weeks by the same physician, who reduced the daily prednisolone dose by 2.5 mg if the daily diary card variables and measurements of lung function were unchanged or improved. All other treatment remained unchanged. After 24 weeks of treatment the prednisolone dose had been reduced by a significantly greater proportion in the methotrexate than in the placebo group (50% vs 14%) and the reduction was not sustained after the study treatment stopped. There were substantial abnormalities in liver function tests in 5 of the 38 patients taking methotrexate.<doc-sep>Comparison of methotrexate 30 mg per week with placebo in chronic steroid-dependent asthma: a 12-week double-blind, cross-over study.<doc-sep>Methotrexate has been shown to have a steroid-sparing effect in chronic steroid-dependent asthmatics at a dose of 15 mg week-1. The aim of this study was to investigate the steroid-sparing activity and adverse events profile of methotrexate 30 mg week-1 in severe steroid-dependent asthma. Eighteen patients who had required 10-50 mg week-1 prednisolone for at least 6 months were asked to participate in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled cross-over study lasting 24 weeks. Daily diary cards of symptoms, peak expiratory flow rate and medication requirements were kept and the patients attended for a chest X-ray, spirometry, lung volumes and gas transfer at commencement and after each 12-week treatment period. Every 3 weeks, adverse events were noted and blood taken for full blood count, urea and electrolytes and liver function tests. Twelve patients completed the trial. Withdrawals were due to non-compliance in two patients, pneumonia in two patients, depression in one patient (on placebo) and severe nausea in one patient. Adverse events were common, probably as a consequence of the higher dosage. Prednisolone requirements were not significantly reduced on methotrexate. Lung function improved on methotrexate with a significant rise in maximal mid-expiratory flow rate and a trend towards improvement in FEV1.<doc-sep>The role of methotrexate in the management of steroid-dependent asthma.<doc-sep>Severe asthma often requires high-dose corticosteroid therapy. However, steroid therapy is fraught with many side effects. There are conflicting reports in the literature regarding the role of methotrexate in reducing the steroid requirements of these patients. This study examined the role of low-dose methotrexate in the management of steroid-dependent asthma. Eleven subjects with stable steroid-dependent asthma were enrolled in a placebo-controlled double-blind crossover trial. Patients received methotrexate, 15 mg/wk, or placebo each for two 12-week periods. There was significant improvement of pulmonary function and reduction of prednisone requirement in both placebo and methotrexate treatment periods. However, methotrexate was not superior to placebo. Only 3 of 11 patients responded to methotrexate. Although low-dose methotrexate therapy may have a role in a small select group of steroid-dependent asthmatics, it provided no additional benefit overall.<doc-sep>Methotrexate in the management of severe steroid dependent asthma.<doc-sep>This study was designed to assess the efficacy of low dose methotrexate, 15 mg weekly, as a steroid-sparing agent in asthmatic patients requiring long-term oral prednisone treatment.\n                The study was a randomised, double blind, placebo controlled, cross over study of 48 weeks duration. Eleven patients with severe steroid-dependent asthma were included. A successful outcome was defined as a reduction in mean prednisone requirements of 7 mg daily compared to baseline requirements, during active treatment.\n                Two patients were required to be withdrawn owing to methotrexate-related adverse effects. The mean prednisone dose for patients who completed the study was 14.4 mg per day (95% CI; 13.6, 15.1) during active treatment, and 12.9 mg per day (95% CI: 12.2, 13.6) during placebo treatment (NS). Only one patient reduced his individual dose requirements by more than 7 mg per day, whereas in three patients prednisone requirements actually increased during active treatment. There were no significant differences in symptom scores, pulmonary function data, and exacerbations between active and placebo treatments.\n                No significant steroid-sparing effect was obtained using low dose methotrexate in this study. This negative outcome may be attributable to the small population of patients studied, low baseline FEV1, and the omission of a steroid minimisation run-in period. Our results highlight the importance of careful patient selection and a painstaking approach in the management of patients with steroid-dependent asthma.<doc-sep>",

At baseline the patients (aged 1-12 years) had mild to moderate lung disease, and the prednisone group did not differ significantly from the placebo group for any values measured. After 4 years, the prednisone-treated group had significant advantages over the placebo group for height, weight, vital capacity, forced expiratory volume in 1 s, peak flow rate, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and serum IgG. The prednisone-treated group required 9 admissions to hospital for CF-related pulmonary disease compared with 35 for the placebo group. There were no steroid-induced side-effects.

Anti-inflammatory treatment with corticosteroids may attenuate this response. The effect of a 12 week course of oral prednisolone on spirometry and serum concentrations of interleukin-1 alpha (IL-1 alpha), soluble interleukin-2 receptor (sIL-2R), and IgG was investigated in 24 children with cystic fibrosis. Prednisolone was administered, in a double blind and placebo controlled manner, at an initial dose of 2 mg/kg daily for 14 days and tapered to 1 mg/kg on alternate days for 10 weeks. The treated group (n = 12) experienced an increase in forced expiratory volume in one second and forced vital capacity at 14 days, however, these changes were smaller at 12 weeks. In the treated group, change in pulmonary function was associated with decreased serum IgG and cytokine concentrations. Prednisolone suppresses serum concentrations of these cytokines, which may participate in the inflammatory response, the excessive synthesis of IgG, and airflow obstruction observed in cystic fibrosis patients.<doc-sep>A multicenter study of alternate-day prednisone therapy in patients with cystic fibrosis. Cystic Fibrosis Foundation Prednisone Trial Group.<doc-sep>The purpose of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of alternate-day prednisone therapy in treating patients with mild-to-moderate cystic fibrosis during a 4-year period. In 15 North American cystic fibrosis centers, we screened 320 patients and enrolled 285 patients from April 1986 to December 1987. Patients were randomly assigned to take prednisone, 1 mg/kg per dose or 2 mg/kg per dose, or a matching placebo given on alternate days. Lung function, clinical status, hospitalizations, growth, and steroid side effects were monitored. During the first 24 months the percentage of the predicted forced vital capacity was greater in the 1 mg/kg group (p < 0.0001) and the 2 mg/kg group (p < 0.01) when each was compared with placebo. Patients in the 1 mg/kg group had a higher percentage of predicted forced vital capacity than placebo patients during the entire 48 months (p < 0.0025), but only in the group of patients who were colonized with Pseudomonas aeruginosa at baseline. For 48 months, the 1 mg/kg group had a higher percentage of predicted forced expiratory volume in 1 second than patients given placebo (p < 0.02). The prednisone-treated groups had a reduction in serum IgG concentrations (1 mg/kg vs placebo, p < 0.007; 2 mg/kg vs placebo, p < 0.003). From 6 months onward, height z scores fell in the 2 mg/kg group compared with those given placebo (p < 0.001). For the 1 mg/kg group, height z scores were lower from 24 months. An excess of abnormalities in glucose metabolism was seen in the 2 mg/kg group compared with the placebo group (p < 0.005). Our findings suggest a role for alternate-day prednisone therapy at a dose of 1 mg/kg in patients with mild to moderate cystic fibrosis. The benefit of improved lung function appears to outweigh the potential for adverse effects when the treatment period is less than 24 months.<doc-sep>",

We studied the results of stimulation with pulsatile GnRH after a shorter 'medium-term' period of 3 weeks of treatment with a GnRHa by comparing a cycle without GnRHa pre-treatment with a cycle with GnRHa (post-GnRHa) pre-treatment in 12 patients. We could prove no significant clinical improvement in post-GnRHa cycles. Ovulation rates were similar. However, in the post-GnRHa cycles, two ongoing pregnancies were observed versus one spontaneous abortion in the cycles without GnRHa pre-treatment. This observation might be explained by the fact that follicular phase LH levels in post-GnRHa cycles were significantly decreased.<doc-sep>Use of combined exogenous gonadotropins and pulsatile gonadotropin-releasing hormone in patients with polycystic ovarian disease.<doc-sep>We previously tested a combined regimen based on the administration of gonadotropin in the early follicular phase followed by pulsatile gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) until complete follicular maturation in patients suffering from polycystic ovarian disease.

We therefore evaluated in this study whether starting pulsatile GnRH therapy before gonadotropin administration might reduce premature luteinization. Eight women underwent induction of ovulation with both combined therapy and pure exogenous follicle-stimulating hormone alone using a crossover scheme. No premature luteinization and a single follicular growth were recorded with the modified combined regimen.

DESIGN: Subgroup analysis within a randomized, controlled, multicenter study. SETTING: Women referred to the Infertility Clinic, Catharina Hospital Eindhoven, The Netherlands. PATIENT(s): Twenty-eight infertile patients with PCOS. INTERVENTIONs): Patients were randomly assigned to pulsatile IV GnRH (10-20 microgram/90 min) after GnRH-a down-regulation or CC (50-150 mg; cycle days 3-7). Patients were monitored on alternate days with ovarian sonography and serum concentrations of E(2), LH, and FSH. Serum P and sonography confirmed ovulation. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(s): Serum concentrations of E(2), LH, and FSH were assessed before treatment was started and after each ovarian sonography. RESULT(s): In ovulatory cycles, no statistically significant differences were observed during the follicular phase comparing serum concentrations of E(2), LH, and FSH between the treatments. However, a significant increase in LH occurred in the GnRH group. CONCLUSION(s): No significant endocrine differences were observed between GnRH and CC treatment. However, there was a significant increase in the serum LH concentration during the follicular phase in the GnRH group. Increments of LH in the GnRH group may be due to recovery of endogenous LH secretion.<doc-sep>",

During the 44 week study the reduced dosage group showed increased morbidity and one-third of these patients had a schizophrenic relapse. The greatest deterioration occurred in patients reduced from above to below 200 mg cis(z)-flupenthixol decanoate biweekly. A review of all the patients entered into the study showed a relationship between deterioration of schizophrenic and depressive features and cis(z)-flupenthixol plasma levels which reflected the administered dosage. Prolactin levels in general did not reflect control of schizophrenic symptoms. Side-effects were few, and there was no emergence of tardive dyskinesia. A multicentre trial is needed for further evaluation.<doc-sep>Low-dose neuroleptic treatment of outpatient schizophrenics. I. Preliminary results for relapse rates.<doc-sep>In an attempt to begin to establish minimum effective dosage requirements for the maintenance treatment of schizophrenia, we undertook a double-blind comparison of low-dose fluphenazine decanoate (1.25 to 5.0 mg/2 wk) with the standard-dose regimen (12.5 to 50.0 mg/2 wk) in outpatient schizophrenics. For the first 126 patients studied, cumulative relapse rates at one year for the low dose were 56% and for the standard dose 7%, a significant difference. Despite the fact that very little dyskinetic symptomatology developed in the sample as a whole, the low-dose treatment appeared to have a significant advantage in producing fewer early signs of tardive dyskinesia. Severity of relapse and total cumulative dosage were also considered.<doc-sep>A single-blind, randomized trial comparing quetiapine and haloperidol in the treatment of tardive dyskinesia.<doc-sep>While the atypical antipsychotics should ultimately reduce the prevalence of tardive dyskinesia, it is likely to remain a significant clinical problem for a long time to come. No strategy has clearly emerged as the treatment of choice for tardive dyskinesia. Atypical antipsychotics have reduced propensities for producing acute extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS) and possibly tardive dyskinesia and may be effective in treating patients with established tardive dyskinesia.\n                This 12-month, randomized, investigator-blinded study compared the efficacy of quetiapine (N = 22) and haloperidol (N = 23) in treating patients with DSM-IV schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder and established tardive dyskinesia. Dyskinesia was assessed using the Extrapyramidal Symptom Rating Scale (ESRS) dyskinesia subscale scores and the Clinical Global Impression (CGI) dyskinesia scores. Other EPS, weight, serum prolactin level, and glycosylated hemoglobin level were also assessed. Subjects were enrolled in the study between April 2000 and March 2002.\n                Mean endpoint doses were 400 mg/day of quetiapine and 8.5 mg/day of haloperidol. Compared with the haloperidol group, the quetiapine group showed significantly greater improvements in ESRS dyskinesia (6 and 9 months [p <or=.01]) and CGI dyskinesia (from 6 months onward [p <.05] and with repeated-measures analysis [p =.002]). Response rate (>or= 50% symptom reduction) was greater with quetiapine than haloperidol (64% [9/14] and 37% [6/16] at 6 months; 55% [6/11] and 28% [4/14] at 12 months). Other EPS decreased significantly with quetiapine at 3 (p =.01), 6 (p =.01), and 9 (p =.002) months. Serum prolactin levels decreased with quetiapine but increased with haloperidol, differing significantly between the groups at endpoint (p =.005). No significant changes in weight or glucose metabolism were recorded in either group.\n                Quetiapine effectively reduces the severity of tardive dyskinesia and is well tolerated in patients with established tardive dyskinesia.<doc-sep>A comparison of masking effects of haloperidol versus molindone in tardive dyskinesia.<doc-sep>An experimental method was utilized to compare the masking effects of two neuroleptic agents--molindone and haloperidol--on 18 neuroleptic-treated schizophrenic patients exhibiting operationally defined withdrawal-exacerbated tardive dyskinesia. After a week on one of these two medications at preestablished doses equivalent to that of the pre-study neuroleptic, molindone-masked total AIMS scores by significantly less (12%) than haloperidol (27%). Similarly, during a second week when the dose of these neuroleptics was equivalent to 200% that of the pre-study dose, molindone masked the total AIMS score significantly less (23%) as compared to haloperidol (53%). Several interpretations of this finding are considered.

Small premature babies are not suitable for shunt surgery because of high cerebrospinal fluid protein and risk of obstruction. For this reason there is a great need for alternative approaches for treatment of posthaemorrhagic hydrocephalus. The objective of this study was to investigate if intraventricular streptokinase treatment reduces the need for ventriculoperitoneal shunt in posthaemorrhagic hydrocephalus. A case-control trial was carried out in 12 premature babies with posthaemorrhagic hydrocephalus. Six of them were treated with intraventricular streptokinase and 6 premature babies were in the control group. While 5 babies in the study group needed ventriculoperitoneal shunt, 3 of the control patients needed shunt surgery. There were no rebleeding, ventriculitis or meningitis in either groups.

A case-control trial was carried out in 12 neonates affected by intraventricular haemorrhage and subsequent progressive ventriculomegaly. Six of them were treated with 20,000 U/day of streptokinase infused over 96 h through a percutaneous ventricular catheter.

         "Effect of fluid administration on the development of symptomatic patent ductus arteriosus and congestive heart failure in premature infants.<doc-sep>We studied 170 premature infants with birth weights between 751 and 2000 g in a randomized sequential trial comparing \"high\" and \"low\" volumes of fluid intake. Beginning on the third day of life, the low-volume group received only enough water to meet average estimated requirements, and the high-volume group received an excess of at least 20 ml per kilogram of body weight per day (mean excess, 47 ml per kilogram per day). Sequential analysis showed that the risk of patent ductus arteriosus with congestive heart failure was greater in infants receiving the high-volume regimen. Thirty-five of 85 infants in the high-volume group acquired murmurs consistent with patent ductus arteriosus, and 11 of these 35 had congestive heart failure. Only nine of 85 infants in the low-volume group had murmurs consistent with patent ductus arteriosus, and two of these nine had congestive heart failure. More cases of necrotizing enterocolitis also occurred in the high-volume group. We conclude that limitation of fluid intake to amounts estimated to meet requirements for excretion, insensible loss, and growth can reduce the risks of patent ductus arteriosus and congestive heart failure in premature infants.<doc-sep>Randomized trial of two levels of fluid input in the perinatal period--effect on fluid balance, electrolyte and metabolic disturbances in ventilated VLBW infants.<doc-sep>The aim of this study was to determine whether fluid restriction does indeed significantly increase acute adverse effects. One-hundred-and-sixty-eight ventilated infants, median gestational age 27 wk (range 23-33) and birthweight 953 g (range 486-1500), entered into a randomized controlled trial of two fluid regimes. Infants on regime A were to be prescribed 60 ml/kg of fluids on day 1 which was gradually increased over the first week to 150 ml/kg, infants on fluid regime B were to be prescribed approximately 20% less fluid over the first week. Daily fluid input and output were recorded. Serum electrolytes, bilirubin, creatinine and urine osmolalities were measured daily. Arginine vasopressin levels were assessed on days 1, 3 and 5. Episodes of jaundice, hypoglycaemia and hypotension requiring treatment were noted. Infants on regime B actually received overall 11% and, in the first 4 days, 19% less fluid than those on regime A (p < 0.001). There were no statistically significant differences in the occurrence of episodes of jaundice, hypotension, hypoglycaemia, hypernatraemia or hyponatraemia between infants on the two regimes. Although the infants on regime B had significantly higher urine osmolalities and lower urine output for most of the perinatal period, their median creatinine and arginine vasopressin levels did not differ significantly from those on regime A. We conclude that fluid restriction to less than 90% of usual maintenance fluids is not associated with an excess of acute adverse effects.<doc-sep>Fluid restriction for preventing bronchopulmonary dysplasia? Reduced fluid intake during the first weeks of life improves the outcome of low-birth-weight infants.<doc-sep>One hundred consecutive low-birth-weight infants (less than 1751 g) were randomized equally into \"dry\" and \"control\" groups. Fluid administration in the dry group followed the schema 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100 and 120 ml/kg/day during the first week and 150 ml/kg/day until aged four weeks and that of the control group 80, 100, 120 and 150 ml/kg/day during the first week and 200 ml/kg afterwards. The diagnosis of bronchopulmonary dysplasia was based on typical roentgenographic findings, clinical symptoms and a supplemental oxygen requirement at age one month. Mean weight loss was greater in the dry group than in the control group (8.8 vs 6.2%), but there was no difference in weight between the groups at the age of four weeks. Twelve of the patients died, one in the dry group and 11 in the control group (five died during the first 24 h and the remaining six between three days and three months). Twenty-seven subjects in the dry group and 15 in the control group were alive and had no signs of bronchopulmonary dysplasia at age 28 days (p less than 0.05), the numbers at term being 28 and 14, respectively (p less than 0.01). These results suggest that fluid restrictions can reduce the mortality and morbidity of low-birth-weight infants. Infants of this kind, with respiratory distress, show poor tolerance to fluids, especially during the first weeks of life.<doc-sep>Water balance in very low-birth-weight infants: relationship to water and sodium intake and effect on outcome.<doc-sep>The clinical effects of fluid therapy designed to maintain different degrees of negative water balance during the first five days of life were determined prospectively in 88 very low-birth-weight infants. Infants with birth weights of 750 to 1,500 gm were matched for birth weight in 250 gm increments. RDS or no RDS, asphyxiated or not, and inborn or outborn. Each infant was randomized to either Group 1--fluids managed to allow 1 to 2% loss of BW per day to a maximum loss of 8 to 10%, or Group 2--fluids managed to allow 3 to 5% loss of BW per day to a maximum loss of 13 to 15%. The mean five-day cumulative fluid input in Group 2 was 220 ml/kg less than in Group 1, yet Group 2 lost only 41 gm/kg more than did Group 1 (8.8% of BW lost in Group 1 vs 12.9% of BW lost in Group 2, P less than 0.001). There were no statistically significant differences between the groups in incidence of clinically significant patent ductus arteriosus, intracranial hemorrhage, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, necrotizing enterocolitis, dehydration, acute renal failure, or metabolic disturbances. There was no difference in duration of respiratory support required, in time to regain BW, or in time to discharge. There was no difference in the neonatal mortality rate. Fluid input in VLBW infants can be flexible to allow the gradual loss of 5 to 15% of birth weight during the first week of life without adversely affecting outcome.<doc-sep>[Effects of highly varying parenteral fluid intakes in premature and newborn infants during the first three days of life (author's transl)].<doc-sep>Under standardized conditions two random groups of 28 premature and newborn infants, each mostly suffering from a respiratory distress syndrome, were given infusions of either 60 or 150 ml/kg per day on the first three days of life. On each of the three days an increase of the infusion quantity resulted in a 2--3 times larger urine flow, the osmolal clearance increasing significantly at the same time. This was mainly due to a higher loss of NaCl, whereas there were no significant or only small differences in the excretion of all other electrolytes, acids, and nitrogenous metabolites. There was no clear evidence that a larger fluid intake had an influence on the endogenous creatinine clearance. Considerably negative effects of an increased infusion quantity were not observed in these investigations, yet one should use extreme caution as ductus arteriosus persistens as well as bronchopulmonal dysplasia are attributed to large fluid intakes during the first days of life.<doc-sep>",
         "Based on this analysis, the most prudent prescription for water intake to premature infants would seem to be careful restriction of water intake so that physiological needs are met without allowing significant dehydration.

         "Randomized comparison of intramuscular artemether and intravenous quinine in adult, Melanesian patients with severe or complicated, Plasmodium falciparum malaria in Papua New Guinea.<doc-sep>An open-label, randomized, controlled trial was used to compare the safety and efficacy of intramuscular artemether (a loading dose of 3.2 mg/kg, followed by 1.6 mg/kg daily for 4 days) and intravenous quinine (a loading dose of 20 mg quinine dihydrochloride/kg, followed first by 10 mg/kg every 8 h, each injection taking 4 h, for at least 48 h, and then oral quinine for a total of 7 days) in the management of strictly defined severe/complicated malaria in Melanesian adults. Four (12%) of the 33 patients who enrolled and completed follow-up died (one of the 15 who received artemether and three of the 18 who received quinine). Overall, cerebral malaria was uncommon (6%) whilst jaundice was common (76%). The time taken to clear 50% of parasites was less in those treated with artemether (median = 8 h; range = 2-24 h) than in the patients given quinine (median = 14 h; range = 2-25 h; P = 0.05). Temperature defervescence was also quicker in those treated with artemether (median = 32 hours; range = 20-112 h) than in those in the quinine group (median = 48 h; range = 28-88 h; P = 0.034). Hypoglycaemia was not observed in any patient treated with artemether but complicated therapy in 11 (79%) of the 14 patients given quinine who had not had pre-treatment spontaneous hypoglycaemia. No serious adverse effects were attributable to artemether. The Plasmodium falciparum infections observed during the 1 month of follow-up, in three patients who had received artemether and two who had been given quinine, were probably due to recrudescence. Plasmodium vivax parasitaemias were also observed during follow-up, in one or two patients in each treatment group. Artemether appears safe in Melanesian adults and is probably as effective as intravenous quinine in the treatment of severe or complicated falciparum malaria.<doc-sep>Comparison of artemether and quinine in the treatment of severe falciparum malaria in south-east Thailand.<doc-sep>One hundred and two Thai patients with severe falciparum malaria (92 males and 10 females) were allocated at random to receive either the standard regimen of quinine infusion (52 cases) or intramuscular artemether (50 cases). The patients in both groups had comparable admission clinical and laboratory data. Artemether gave a better survival rate (87.2% vs. 63.3%) and parasite clearance time (54 vs. 78 h) than quinine. Fever clearance times (79 h vs. 84 h) and time to recovery of consciousness (48 h in both groups) were comparable. Previous treatment with quinine or mefloquine had no influence on treatment outcome. The most common adverse effect in patients treated with quinine was tinnitus. Two patients had severe hearing impairment which resolved within 1 week after the end of treatment. Mild, transient pain was noted at the injection site of artemether but no abscess formed. QTc wave prolongation was seen in most patients receiving quinine; however, no arrhythmia was observed despite the high concentration of quinine in some patients who had received quinine before admission. Complications developed in 7 survivors in each treatment group. No patient in the artemether group had neurological sequelae after recovery of consciousness, but 2 in the quinine group had left facial palsy and one had a myasthenia gravis-like syndrome. No patient died with complications in he artemether group, but 7 died with pulmonary complications in the quinine group.<doc-sep>Preliminary report: a comparative clinical trial of artemether and quinine in severe falciparum malaria.<doc-sep>Twenty-six patients with severe falciparum malaria were randomized to be treated with quinine or artemether. Twelve patients received quinine at the standard dose and fourteen patients received artemether intramuscularly at a total dose of 640 mg over 7 days. The patients were kept in the hospital for at least 7 days. Peripheral smear was performed 6-hourly until there was no parasitemia, then daily until discharged. Adverse effects were monitored through physical examination, laboratory findings and questionnaires. Laboratory examination was performed on admission, day 2, day 4 weekly until discharged. The patients in both groups were comparable in age, body weight, admission parasitemia, hemoglobin and white blood cell count. The survival rates were 93% and 58% in artemether and quinine groups, respectively (p = 0.052 at 95% confidence, using Fisher's exact test). The parasite and fever clearance times, and the time taken to gain consciousness in cerebral malaria patients were not significantly different between the two groups. Adverse effects in the quinine group consisted of dizziness and vertigo which were found in 4 patients. No adverse effects were noticed in the artemether group. This preliminary report suggests that artemether is a good alternative drug for severe falciparum malaria and seems to be better than quinine regarding survival rate and side effects. Confirmation of these findings in a larger study size is needed.<doc-sep>Intramuscular artemether vs intravenous quinine: an open, randomized trial in Malawian children with cerebral malaria.<doc-sep>To compare artemether (by intramuscular injection) and quinine (by intravenous infusion) as treatments for cerebral malaria in African children.\n                An open, randomized trial conducted at the Queen Elizabeth Central Hospital in Blantyre, Malawi.

Data from 83 artemether recipients and 81 quinine recipients are reported here.\n                Overall mortality rates and coma resolution times were not significantly different in the two treatment groups. Parasite and fever clearance times were significantly more rapid in the artemether recipients. Analyses which took into account the possible confounding variables did not significantly alter the findings of these unadjusted analyses.\n                These results do not suggest that treatment with artemether would confer a survival advantage in children with life-threatening malaria.

It has been studied extensively in China, where it has been shown to be rapidly effective in severe falciparum malaria. Nearly all the patients studied previously were adults. We have investigated the efficacy of artemether in children with moderate or severe falciparum malaria. In the preliminary study of moderately severe malaria, 30 Gambian children were randomised in pairs to receive either intramuscular artemether (4 mg/kg loading dose followed by 2 mg/kg daily) or intramuscular chloroquine ('Nivaquine') 3.5 mg base/kg every 6 h. Both drugs were well tolerated and rapidly effective. The times to parasite clearance were significantly shorter in the artemether recipients (mean 36.7 [SD 11.3] vs 48.4 [16.8] h, p less than 0.05). 43 children with severe malaria were then randomised to receive intramuscular treatment with the same regimens of artemether (n = 21) or chloroquine (n = 22) as used in the preliminary study. 8 children (19%) died. There were no significant differences between the two groups in the clinical, haematological, biochemical, or parasitological measures of therapeutic response in survivors and there was no evidence of local or systemic toxicity. Despite similar parasite counts on admission, clearance times overall were longer in severe malaria than in moderate malaria. Artemether is a well tolerated and rapidly effective parenteral treatment for severe malaria in children, and would be especially valuable in areas with chloroquine-resistant P falciparum.<doc-sep>Comparison of artemisinin suppositories, intramuscular artesunate and intravenous quinine for the treatment of severe childhood malaria.<doc-sep>Severe malaria remains a major cause of mortality and morbidity for children living in many tropical regions. With the emergence of strains of Plasmodium falciparum resistant to both chloroquine and quinine, alternative antimalarial agents are required. The artemisinin group of compounds are rapidly effective in severe disease when given by intramuscular or intravenous injection. However, these routes of administration are not always available in rural areas. In an open, randomized comparison 109 Vietnamese children, aged between 3 months and 14 years, with severe P.falciparum malaria, were allocated at random to receive artemisinin suppositories followed by mefloquine (n = 37), intramuscular artesunate followed by mefloquine (n = 37), or intravenous quinine followed by pyrimethamine/sulfadoxine (n = 35). There were 9 deaths: 2 artemisinin, 4 artesunate and 5 quinine-treated children. There was no difference in fever clearance time, coma recovery, or length of hospital stay among the 3 groups. However, parasite clearance times were significantly faster in artemisinin and artesunate-treated patients than in those who received quinine (P < 0.0001). Both artemisinin and artesunate were very well tolerated, but children receiving these drugs had lower peripheral reticulocyte counts by day 5 of treatment than those in the quinine group (P = 0.011). No other adverse effect or toxicity was found. There was no treatment failure in these 2 groups, but 4 patients in the quinine group failed to clear their parasites within 7 d of starting treatment and required alternative antimalarial therapy. Artemisinin suppositories are easy to administer, cheap, and very effective for treating children with severe malaria. In rural areas where medical facilities are lacking these drugs will allow antimalarial therapy to be instituted earlier in the course of the disease and may therefore save lives.<doc-sep>Artemether 5 versus 7 day regimen for severe falciparum malaria.<doc-sep>Twenty-eight male Thai patients with severe falciparum malaria were randomized to receive either artemether for a 5 (300 mg initial dose followed by 100 mg for another 4 days) or a 7 days regimen (160 mg initial dose, followed by 80 mg daily for another 6 days). Thirteen patients received a 5 day regimen and 15 received 7 day regimen. The follow-up period was 28 days. The patients in both groups were comparable in age, body weight, admission parasitemia, hematocrit and white cell count. There were 4 patients in each group who presented with cerebral malaria. The median values of parasite and fever clearance times (PCT and FCT) in the 5 and 7 days regimens were 52 vs 60 hours, and 85 vs 68 hours, respectively. There were 8 and 4 patients, respectively who had recrudescence during days 15 to 25. The cure rates were 38% (95% CI = 14-68%) and 73% (95% CI - 50-96%), respectively for 5 and 7 day regimens. None died in either group. No patients in either group had neurological sequelae after recovery of consciousness. Clinically adverse effects in either group were transient pain at the site of injection. No drug related biochemical or ECG changes were noted in either group. The duration of treatment is the determinant of the cure rate; however, the duration of even 7 days still resulted in high recrudescence rate. It may be necessary to combine artemether with other longer half-life antimalarials to improve the cure rate.<doc-sep>A comparative clinical trial of sequential treatments of severe malaria with artesunate suppository followed by mefloquine in Thailand.<doc-sep>Sixty-three patients with severe falciparum malaria were randomly administered one of the two regimens of a sequential combination of artesunate suppository followed by an oral mefloquine tablet. Thirty-two patients received artesunate suppositories (200 mg/capsule) given rectally at 0, 4, 8, 12, 24, 36, 48, and 60 hr (total = 1,600 mg: Group I). Thirty-one patients received the same artesunate suppositories given rectally at 0, 12, 24, 36, 48, and 60 hr (total = 1,200 mg: Group II). Both regimens were followed by two doses of oral mefloquine, 750 mg given at 72 hr and 500 mg at 84 hr. Patient baseline characteristics were comparable in the two groups. All patients were admitted for 28 days to the Bangkok Hospital for Tropical Diseases to assess efficacy, tolerability, and delayed neuropsychiatric effects. The mean [SD] parasite clearance time was significantly shorter in Group I than Group II (47.3 [12.4] hr versus 55.3 [17.4] hr; P = 0.05) and the rate of parasite reduction was significantly faster in Group I (P = 0.05, by log-rank test). Mean [SD] fever clearance times were similar in the two Groups (71.1 [41.2] hr and 76.9 [47.9] hr, respectively). Twenty-two patients with unrousable coma on admission (median Glasgow Coma Score = 9) regained consciousness after 1-4 days. No deaths occurred. Sixty of sixty-three patients were parasitologically and clinically cured within 3-4 days of treatment. Three patients (5%) with deteriorating conditions required rescue treatment (one patient in Group I was administered intravenous artesunate, and two patients in Group II required two extra doses of suppository). No patients had major adverse drug effects. The cure rates at 28 days of follow-up in Group I were 96% (26 of 27 patients) and 89% (24 of 27 patients) in Group II. Artesunate suppository followed by mefloquine was well tolerated and effective. In severe malaria, the sequential treatment is a suitable alternative treatment to parenteral drugs. Further studies in a larger number of patients under field conditions are required.<doc-sep>Artemether in the treatment of multiple drug resistant falciparum malaria.<doc-sep>Artemether has the potential to be an alternative antimalarial for multiple drug resistant falciparum malaria. However, it has been associated with high recrudescent rates which may be due to incorrect dosage regimens. The dosage regimens are varied from country to contry. We have carried out a comparative study of two dosage regimens, ie 480 mg and 600 mg total dose given over 5 days in uncomplicated and severe falciparum malaria. 167 patients were included in the study, 61 with acute uncomplicated falciparum malaria and 106 with severe malaria. All patients showed a good initial response. The difference in total dose had no effect on the parasite or fever clearance time (PCT or FCT). However, the severity of the disease did have some influence of these times. The PCT and FCT from either regimen of uncomplicated malaria were significantly faster than those of severe malaria (p < 0.005 and = 0.05, respectively). The cure rate seems to have some correlation with the amount of drug given and severity of the disease. The cure rates in uncomplicated malaria were 84 and 92%, respectively, for 480 mg and 600 mg. In severe malaria the cure rates dropped to 65 and 76%, respectively, for 480 and 600 mg. We conclude that artemether can be considered as an alternative antimalarial for multiple drug resistant falciparum malaria. However, the cure rate of severe falciparum malaria in this study is not considered satisfactory in areas with multiple drug resistant falciparum malaria. Further studies are needed to assess the curative efficacy with different dosage regimens.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)<doc-sep>Comparison of artemisinin suppositories with intravenous artesunate and intravenous quinine in the treatment of cerebral malaria.<doc-sep>Seventy-nine comatose cerebral malaria patients given standard supportive treatment were randomized to receive specific antimalarial chemotherapy of intravenous quinine, intravenous artesunate, or artemisinin suppositories. Artesunate and artemisinin reduced peripheral asexual parasitaemia significantly more rapidly than quinine (90% clearance time 16 h, 18.9 h and 34.5 h respectively), but did not significantly reduce the duration of coma or mortality. The rapid lowering of peripheral parasitaemia may not ameliorate complications already present. These results demonstrate that artemisinin suppositories are as effective as artesunate and quinine given intravenously, and have economic and practical advantages for the treatment of severe malaria in areas remote from major medical centres. However, large numbers of patients will need to be studied if differences in mortality between the 3 treatment groups are to be demonstrated.<doc-sep>Comparative efficacy of intramuscular artemether and intravenous quinine in Nigerian children with cerebral malaria.<doc-sep>The efficacy of a 5-day treatment with intramuscular artemether (3.2-mg/kg loading dose followed by 1.6 mg/kg daily) was compared to that of the standard 7-day treatment with quinine (20-mg/kg loading dose followed by 10 mg/kg every 8 h) in a randomised clinical trial including 103 children aged 12-60 months with cerebral malaria between 1994 and 1996. No statistical difference of immediate efficacy was found between the two treatments. There were 11 (20%) deaths in the artemether group and 14 (28%) in the children who received quinine. The respective artemether versus quinine median fever clearance times (h) were 39 (interquartile ranges [IQ] 30-54) vs. 48 (IQ 30-60), and parasite clearance 42 (IQ 24-60) vs. 36 (IQ 30-48). However, one patient who received artemether had a recrudescence on day 14, which was successfully treated with sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine. Times to recovery from coma were 24 h (IQ 18-45) and 33 h (IQ 19-57), respectively. The occurrence of transient neurological sequelae including motor disabilities, cortical blindness, and afebrile seizures was also similar in the two groups. No adverse reactions to the two drugs were recorded during the study period. Artemether represents an important option in the management of cerebral malaria in Nigeria especially in rural areas where facilities for intravenous administration may not yet be optimal.<doc-sep>A trial of artemether or quinine in children with cerebral malaria.<doc-sep>Cerebral malaria has a mortality rate of 10 to 30 percent despite treatment with parenteral quinine, a situation that may worsen with the spread of quinine resistance. Artemether is a new antimalarial agent that clears parasites from the circulation more rapidly than quinine, but its effect on mortality is unclear.\n                We conducted a randomized, unblinded comparison of intramuscular artemether and intramuscular quinine in 576 Gambian children with cerebral malaria. The primary end points of the study were mortality and residual neurologic sequelae.\n                Fifty-nine of the 288 children treated with artemether died in the hospital (20.5 percent), as compared with 62 of the 288 treated with quinine (21.5 percent). Among the 418 children analyzed at approximately five months for neurologic disease, residual neurologic sequelae were detected in 7 of 209 survivors treated with artemether (3.3 percent) and 11 of 209 survivors treated with quinine (5.3 percent, P = 0.5). After adjustment for potential confounders, the odds ratio for death was 0.84 (95 percent confidence interval, 0.53 to 1.32) in the artemether group, and for residual neurologic sequelae, 0.51 (95 percent confidence interval, 0.17 to 1.47). There were fewer local reactions at the injection site with artemether than with quinine (0.7 percent vs. 5.9 percent, P = 0.001).\n                Artemether is as effective as quinine in the treatment of cerebral malaria in children.<doc-sep>Severe and complicated malaria treated with artemisinin, artesunate or artemether in Viet Nam.<doc-sep>One hundred and seventy five Vietnamese adults with severe and complicated malaria admitted to a rural district hospital were entered into an open randomized comparative study to compare 4 treatment regimens based on artemisinin and its derivatives. The median time of defervescence was 48 h (95% confident interval [CI] 38-58 h) in those given intramuscular (i.m.) artemether, 42 h (95% CI 36-48 h) in those given artemisinin suppositories, 36 h (95% CI 30-42 h) in those receiving artesunate (i.m.) and 30 h (95% CI 18-42 h) in those receiving intravenous artesunate (P = 0.13). The respective median parasite clearance times were 30 h (95% CI 26-34 h), 30 h (95% CI 24-36 h), 24 h (95% CI 15-33 h), and 24 h (95% CI 15-33 h) (P = 0.30); the median times for recovery of consciousness were 47 h (95% CI 31-63 h), 24 h (95% CI 18-30 h), 30 h (95% CI 18-42 h), and 24 h (95% CI 4-44 h) (P = 0.18); and the mortality rates were 11.1%, 17.6%, 10.2% and 16.6%, respectively (P = 0.64).

The parasite clearance time (PCT), fever subsidence time (FST) and coma resolution time (CRT) were shorter in the artemisinin treated group. There was no significant different in the parasitological cure rates in both arms of treatment. No correlation was observed between the initial parasite density and PCT or FST in both groups of treatment. Mortality rates were similar both in the artemisinin and quinine groups. The common adverse effects observed in most patients receiving quinine, in an increasing order of occurrence were; vomiting, dizziness, hypoglycaemia and tinnitus, which were all relatively rare with artemisinin. Some patients treated with artemisinin showed tenesmus which was not observed in any patient treated with quinine.\n                The rectal artemisinin is more efficacious and safer than the intravenous quinine. Thus, artemisinin may be considered a potential drug which can replace quinine in the treatment of severe malaria in Ethiopia provided it is made available at affordable prices.<doc-sep>A controlled trial of artemether or quinine in Vietnamese adults with severe falciparum malaria.<doc-sep>Artemisinin (qinghaosu) and its derivatives are rapidly effective antimalarial drugs derived from a Chinese plant. Preliminary studies suggest that these drugs may be more effective than quinine in the treatment of severe malaria. We studied artemether in Vietnam, where Plasmodium falciparum has reduced sensitivity to quinine.\n                We conducted a randomized, double-blind trial in 560 adults with severe falciparum malaria. Two hundred seventy-six received intramuscular quinine dihydrochloride (20 mg per kilogram of body weight followed by 10 mg per kilogram every eight hours), and 284 received intramuscular artemether (4 mg per kilogram followed by 2 mg per kilogram every eight hours). Both drugs were given for a minimum of 72 hours.\n                There were 36 deaths in the artemether group (13 percent) and 47 in the quinine group (17 percent; P = 0.16; relative risk of death in the patients given artemether, 0.74; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.5 to 1.11). The parasites were cleared more quickly from the blood in the artemether group (mean, 72 vs. 90 hours; P < 0.001); however, in this group fever resolved more slowly (127 vs. 90 hours, P < 0.001), the time to recovery from coma was longer (66 vs. 48 hours, P = 0.003), and the hospitalization was longer (288 vs. 240 hours, P = 0.005). Quinine treatment was associated with a higher risk of hypoglycemia (relative risk, 2.7; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.7 to 4.4; P < 0.001), but there were no other serious side effects in either group.\n                Artemether is a satisfactory alternative to quinine for the treatment of severe malaria in adults.<doc-sep>An open randomized comparison of intravenous and intramuscular artesunate in severe falciparum malaria.<doc-sep>An open paired randomized comparison of intramuscular and intravenous artesunate was conducted in 28 adult patients with severe falciparum malaria. The dose regimen in both groups was 2 mg/kg given immediately followed by 1 mg/kg at 12 and 24 h, and then daily until the patient could swallow. Both routes of administration were well tolerated and there was no evidence of toxicity. One patient in each treatment group died. Clinical and parasitological measures of recovery in survivors were similar in the 2 groups with mean fever clearance times of 37.3 h (standard deviation [SD] = 26.1 h) and 31.5 h (SD = 24.2 h) and mean parasite clearance times of 33.4 h (SD = 13.9 h) and 29.4 h (SD = 12.7 h) in the intravenous and intramuscular groups respectively.

         "Adverse effects of prolonged hyperventilation in patients with severe head injury: a randomized clinical trial.<doc-sep>There is still controversy over whether or not patients should be hyperventilated after traumatic brain injury, and a randomized trial has never been conducted. The theoretical advantages of hyperventilation are cerebral vasoconstriction for intracranial pressure (ICP) control and reversal of brain and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) acidosis. Possible disadvantages include cerebral vasoconstriction to such an extent that cerebral ischemia ensues, and only a short-lived effect on CSF pH with a loss of HCO3-buffer from CSF. The latter disadvantage might be overcome by the addition of the buffer tromethamine (THAM), which has shown some promise in experimental and clinical use. Accordingly, a trial was performed with patients randomly assigned to receive normal ventilation (PaCO2 35 +/- 2 mm Hg (mean +/- standard deviation): control group), hyperventilation (PaCO2 25 +/- 2 mm Hg: HV group), or hyperventilation plus THAM (PaCO2 25 +/- 2 mm Hg: HV + THAM group). Stratification into subgroups of patients with motor scores of 1-3 and 4-5 took place. Outcome was assessed according to the Glasgow Outcome Scale at 3, 6, and 12 months. There were 41 patients in the control group, 36 in the HV group, and 36 in the HV + THAM group. The mean Glasgow Coma Scale score for each group was 5.7 +/- 1.7, 5.6 +/- 1.7, and 5.9 +/- 1.7, respectively; this score and other indicators of severity of injury were not significantly different. A 100% follow-up review was obtained. At 3 and 6 months after injury the number of patients with a favorable outcome (good or moderately disabled) was significantly (p less than 0.05) lower in the hyperventilated patients than in the control and HV + THAM groups. This occurred only in patients with a motor score of 4-5. At 12 months posttrauma this difference was not significant (p = 0.13). Biochemical data indicated that hyperventilation could not sustain alkalinization in the CSF, although THAM could. Accordingly, cerebral blood flow (CBF) was lower in the HV + THAM group than in the control and HV groups, but neither CBF nor arteriovenous difference of oxygen data indicated the occurrence of cerebral ischemia in any of the three groups. Although mean ICP could be kept well below 25 mm Hg in all three groups, the course of ICP was most stable in the HV + THAM group. It is concluded that prophylactic hyperventilation is deleterious in head-injured patients with motor scores of 4-5.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)<doc-sep>",

Subjective assessments included: frequency and duration of the attacks (both per se and combined to a severity score), cold sensation, numbness, paresthesia, pain, cold water and cold weather provocation and the appearance of spontaneous attacks. The objective measurements comprised Digital Skin Temperature (DST), Digital systolic Blood Pressure (DBP) and Doppler Spectral Analysis (DOSA) of the radial and ulnar arteries. All measurements were performed both at room temperature and after instant cold provocation. The severity score, the occurrence of numbness and paresthesia and cold weather provocation improved significantly on ketanserin treatment. All objective measurements with the exception of the end-diastolic blood flow velocity of DOSA did not show significant improvements. Neither blood chemistry nor systemic blood pressure showed any significant change during ketanserin treatment. However, in the 6 (15%) patients with hypertension both systolic and diastolic blood pressure normalized. Although in objective measurements hardly any significant effects of ketanserin could be demonstrated, the results of the study suggest that orally administered ketanserin is effective for minimizing subjective complaints in patients with PRP.

Active treatment consisted of inhalation of colistin one million units twice daily for three months and was compared to placebo inhalations of isotonic saline. Significantly more patients in the colistin inhalation group completed the study as compared to the placebo group (18 versus 11). Colistin treatment was superior to placebo treatment in terms of a significantly better clinical symptom score, maintenance of pulmonary function and inflammatory parameters. We recommend colistin inhalation therapy for cystic fibrosis patients with chronic P. aeruginosa lung infection as a supplementary treatment to frequent courses of intravenous anti-pseudomonas chemotherapy.<doc-sep>Significant microbiological effect of inhaled tobramycin in young children with cystic fibrosis.<doc-sep>We conducted a double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter, randomized trial to test the hypothesis that 300 mg of tobramycin solution for inhalation administered twice daily for 28 days would be safe and result in a profound decrease in Pseudomonas aeruginosa (Pa) density from the lower airway of young children with cystic fibrosis. Ninety-eight subjects were to be randomized; however, the trial was stopped early because of evidence of a significant microbiological treatment effect. Twenty-one children under age 6 years were randomized (8 active; 13 placebo) and underwent bronchoalveolar lavage at baseline and on Day 28. There was a significant difference between treatment groups in the reduction in Pa density; no Pa was detected on Day 28 in 8 of 8 active group patients compared with 1 of 13 placebo group patients. We observed no differences between treatment groups for clinical indices, markers of inflammation, or incidence of adverse events. No abnormalities in serum creatinine or audiometry and no episodes of significant bronchospasm were observed in association with active treatment. We conclude that 28 days of tobramycin solution for inhalation of 300 mg twice daily is safe and effective for significant reduction of lower airway Pa density in young children with cystic fibrosis.<doc-sep>Placebo-controlled, double-blind, randomized study of aerosolized tobramycin for early treatment of Pseudomonas aeruginosa colonization in cystic fibrosis.<doc-sep>In chronic Pseudomonas aeruginosa pulmonary infection of patients with cystic fibrosis (CF), antibiotic therapy generally fails to eradicate the bacterial pathogen. The mucoid bacterial phenotype, high sputum production by the host, and low airway levels of antibiotics seem to be responsible for the observed decrease in antibiotic efficacy. We hypothesized that early antibiotic treatment by inhalation in CF patients may be able to prevent or at least delay airway infection. In a prospective placebo-controlled, double-blind, randomized multicenter study, 22 CF patients received either 80 mg b.i.d. of aerosolized tobramycin or placebo for a period of 12 months shortly after the onset of P. aeruginosa pulmonary colonization. Two patients in the tobramycin and six patients in the placebo group stopped inhalation before the 12 month treatment period. Using life table analysis, the time to conversion from a P. aeruginosa-positive to a P. aeruginosa-negative respiratory culture was significantly shorter in the tobramycin-treated group than in the placebo group (P < 0.05, log rank test). Lung function parameters and markers of inflammation did not change in either group during treatment. The results of this study suggest that early tobramycin inhalation may prevent and/or delay P. aeruginosa pulmonary infection in CF patients.<doc-sep>Inhaled ceftazidime compared with gentamicin and carbenicillin in older patients with cystic fibrosis infected with Pseudomonas aeruginosa.<doc-sep>A randomized cross-over study was undertaken to compare nebulized (1) ceftazidime with (2) a combination of gentamicin and carbenicillin, and (3) saline, each given for 4 months, in patients with cystic fibrosis infected with Pseudomonas aeruginosa.

Similarly mean forced expiratory volume in 1 second on ceftazidime, 1.70 litres, and on gentamicin and carbenicillin, 1.70 litres, were greater than on saline, 1.48 litres (P less than 0.02 and P less than 0.01 respectively). Mean forced vital capacity on gentamicin and carbenicillin, 2.93 litres, was also greater than on saline (P less than 0.05). We were unable to demonstrate any difference in efficacy between the antibiotic regimens. The patients were admitted to hospital less frequently during the study year compared with the previous year (P less than 0.05).

The purpose of this trial was to assess the efficacy and tolerability of a tobramycin highly concentrated solution for inhalation (TSI) [300mg/4mL; Bramitob when added to other antipseudomonal therapies in CF patients with chronic P. aeruginosa infection.\n                In a multinational, double-blind, multicenter study, CF patients with chronic P. aeruginosa infection were randomized to receive nebulized tobramycin or placebo over a 24-week study period in which 4-week treatment periods ('on' cycles) were followed by 4-week periods without treatment ('off' cycles). Forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV(1)) percentage of predicted normal was used as the primary efficacy outcome parameter. Forced vital capacity (FVC), forced expiratory flow at 25-75% of FVC (FEF(25)(-)(75%)), P. aeruginosa susceptibility, minimum concentration required to inhibit 90% of strains (MIC(90)), rates of P. aeruginosa-negative culture, P. aeruginosa persistence and superinfection, need for hospitalization and parenteral antipseudomonal antibiotics, loss of school/working days due to the disease, and nutritional status (bodyweight and body mass index) were considered as secondary efficacy outcome parameters. Adverse events reporting, audiometry, and renal function were monitored to evaluate the tolerability and safety of TSI.\n                A total of 247 patients were randomized in the study. At endpoint time assessment (week 20), FEV(1) was significantly increased in the tobramycin group and the adjusted mean difference between groups (intention-to-treat population) was statistically significant (p < 0.001). At the same time, clinically relevant improvements in FVC and FEF(25-75%) were detected in the TSI group (p = 0.022 and p = 0.001, respectively). The microbiologic outcomes at the end of the last 'on' cycle period were significantly better in the TSI group than the placebo group (p = 0.024), although there was a concomitant trend toward an increase in the MIC of isolated P. aeruginosa strains. The percentage of patients hospitalized as well as the need for parenteral antipseudomonal antibiotics was significantly lower in the TSI group (p = 0.002 and p = 0.009, respectively). Patients treated with TSI had fewer lost school/working days due to the disease (p < 0.001). A favorable effect of tobramycin in terms of an increase in bodyweight and body mass index was also noted, when compared with placebo, at all time points (p < 0.01 and p < 0.001, respectively). No significant changes in serum creatinine and auditory function were detected. The proportion of patients with drug-related adverse events was 15% in both treatment groups.\n                Long-term, intermittent administration of this aerosolized tobramycin formulation (300mg/4mL) in CF patients with P. aeruginosa chronic infection significantly improved pulmonary function and microbiologic outcome, decreased hospitalizations, increased nutritional status, and was well tolerated.<doc-sep>Nebulized gentamicin in children and adolescents with cystic fibrosis.<doc-sep>A study of 29 children and adolescents with cystic fibrosis over 2 years showed some evidence of benefit from the twice daily inhalation of 20 mg nebulized gentamicin when compared to the inhalation of a nebulized saline mixture.

There was no significant difference in antibiotic usage, days in hospital or clinical symptoms between the two regimes. Those subjects with P. aeruginosa in sputum showed significantly less deterioration in lung function over 2 years while using gentamicin aerosol.

The purpose of this trial was to assess the efficacy and safety of tobramycin nebuliser solution (TNS) and nebulised colistin in CF patients chronically infected with P. aeruginosa. One-hundred and fifteen patients, aged > or = 6 yrs, were randomised to receive either TNS or colistin, twice daily for 4 weeks. The primary end point was an evaluation of the relative change in lung function from baseline, as measured by forced expiratory volume in one second % predicted. Secondary end points included changes in sputum P. aeruginosa density, tobramycin/colistin minimum inhibitory concentrations and safety assessments. TNS produced a mean 6.7% improvement in lung function (p=0.006), whilst there was no significant improvement in the colistin-treated patients (mean change 0.37%). Both nebulised antibiotic regimens produced a significant decrease in the sputum P. aeruginosa density, and there was no development of highly resistant strains over the course of the study. The safety profile for both nebulised antibiotics was good. Tobramycin nebuliser solution significantly improved lung function of patients with cystic fibrosis chronically infected with Pseudomonas aeruginosa, but colistin did not, in this study of 1-month's duration.

Pulmonary function (forced expiratory volume in 1 second [FEV(1)], forced vital capacity [FVC], and forced expiratory flow at the midportion of vital capacity [FEF(25-75%)]), P. aeruginosa susceptibility, microbiologic results, and in vitro minimum inhibitory concentration for 90% of strains (MIC(90)) were the efficacy outcome measures, while safety was monitored by the recording of adverse events, audiometry (bone conduction at 250-8,000Hz frequency), laboratory tests, physical examination and general health condition. The concentration of tobramycin attained in sputum was measured in a cohort of 21 patients.\n                FEV(1) significantly increased from baseline in the tobramycin group compared with no change in the placebo group: the absolute difference between groups (intent-to-treat population) of predicted normal was 13.2% at week 2 (p = 0.002) and 13.3% at week 4 (p = 0.003). Significant differences in favor of the tobramycin group were also observed for FVC and FEF(25-75%). The microbiologic results at the end of the treatment period (P. aeruginosa-negative culture, persistence, superinfection) showed a significantly better outcome in the tobramycin group compared with placebo (p = 0.033). The effects of tobramycin on pulmonary function and microbiology were not maintained at the end of the run-out phase. Mean sputum concentrations of tobramycin after the first dose (695.6 +/- 817.0 microg/mL) were similar to those measured after the last dose (716.9 +/- 799 microg/mL) and were superior to the detected specific MIC(90). The proportion of patients with drug-related adverse events was lower in the tobramycin group and no signs of renal or auditory toxicity were observed.\n                The 4-week administration of a highly concentrated TSI significantly improved pulmonary function and microbiologic outcome compared with placebo and was well tolerated. The results of this study should be confirmed in further long-term trials in larger populations.<doc-sep>Antibiotic prophylaxis in cystic fibrosis: inhaled cephaloridine as an adjunct to oral cloxacillin.<doc-sep>The effect of prophylactic antibiotics on bacterial colonization of the respiratory tract and on general progression of cystic fibrosis was studied in a two-year prospective study of 47 mildly to moderately affected patients. One group of patients received inhaled cephaloridine and the other received no inhaled antibiotic; both groups received cloxacillin orally. Carriage of Haemophilus influenzae was greater in the group not receiving inhaled antibiotic (55% vs 20%). Rates of carriage of Staphylococcus aureus (23%). Pseudomonas aeruginosa (greater than 90%). Pseudomonas cepacia (45%), and other organisms were similar in both groups. There were no significant differences between the two groups in incidence of respiratory tract infections or hospital admissions, clinical scores, radiologic scores, or rate of change of pulmonary function. Although continuous antistaphylococcal antibiotic prophylaxis may be successful in suppressing colonization with S. aureus, it may also contribute to the high rates of carriage of Ps. aeruginosa and Ps. cepacia observed in patients with cystic fibrosis.<doc-sep>A pilot study to compare tobramycin 80 mg injectable preparation with 300 mg solution for inhalation in cystic fibrosis patients.<doc-sep>Inhaled tobramycin has been shown to improve lung function in cystic fibrosis (CF) patients chronically infected with Pseudomonas aeruginosa. However, to date no comparative data are available for different dose regimens used in clinical practice.\n                To compare the clinical efficacy of the two most commonly used treatment regimens of inhaled tobramycin in patients with CF.\n                In an open crossover study of CF patients, subjects were randomly allocated to receive either 80 mg tobramycin twice-daily continuous treatment or 300 mg tobramycin twice daily in cycles of 28 days on and 28 days off treatment. After three months, patients were switched to the alternative treatment regimen.\n                A total of 32 patients with a mean (+/- SD) age of 18.5+/-8.6 years were included in the study. Compared with the treatment period using colistin, forced expiratory volume in 1 s decreased by -2.1+/-13.8% in the 80 mg tobramycin group and increased by +2.3+/-13.0% in the 300 mg group. Similar changes were observed in forced vital capacity (-2.5+/-12.9% in the 80 mg tobramycin group versus +2.5+/-9.6% in the 300 mg tobramycin group). Variability in responses was large but the differences were not statistically significant. Personal preference indicated that the majority of patients preferred the high-dose cycle compared with the lower dose continuous inhalation, but this was not linked to objective data on efficacy.\n                The present trial fails to provide convincing evidence for superiority in efficacy of either of the two treatment regimens of inhaled tobramycin in CF patients.<doc-sep>Inhaled aztreonam lysine for chronic airway Pseudomonas aeruginosa in cystic fibrosis.<doc-sep>The effectiveness and safety of aztreonam lysine for inhalation (AZLI) in patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) on maintenance treatment for Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA) airway infection was evaluated in this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study.\n                To evaluate the safety and efficacy of inhaled aztreonam lysine in controlling PA infection in patients with CF.\n                After randomization and a 28-day course of tobramycin inhalation solution (TIS), patients (n = 211; > or =6 yr; > or =3 TIS courses within previous year; FEV(1) > or = 25% and < or =75% predicted values) were treated with 75 mg AZLI or placebo, twice or three times daily for 28 days, then monitored for 56 days. The primary efficacy endpoint was time to need for additional inhaled or intravenous antipseudomonal antibiotics. Secondary endpoints included changes in respiratory symptoms (CF Questionnaire-Revised [CFQ-R] Respiratory Scale), pulmonary function (FEV(1)), and sputum PA density. Adverse events and minimum inhibitory concentrations of aztreonam for PA were monitored.\n                AZLI treatment increased median time to need for additional antipseudomonal antibiotics for symptoms of pulmonary exacerbation by 21 days, compared with placebo (AZLI, 92 d; placebo, 71 d; P = 0.007). AZLI improved mean CFQ-R respiratory scores (5.01 points, P = 0.02), FEV(1) (6.3%, P = 0.001), and sputum PA density (-0.66 log(10) cfu/g, P = 0.006) compared with placebo; no AZLI dose-response was observed. Adverse events reported for AZLI and placebo were comparable and consistent with CF lung disease. Susceptibility of PA to aztreonam at baseline and end of therapy were similar.\n                AZLI was effective in patients with CF using frequent TIS therapy. AZLI delayed time to need for inhaled or intravenous antipseudomonal antibiotics, improved respiratory symptoms and pulmonary function, and was well tolerated.

We conducted a randomized crossover study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of aerosolized tobramycin in patients with cystic fibrosis and P. aeruginosa infections.\n                Seventy-one patients with stable pulmonary status were recruited from seven U.S. centers for the treatment of cystic fibrosis and randomly assigned to one of two crossover regimens. Group 1 received 600 mg of aerosolized tobramycin for 28 days, followed by half-strength physiologic saline (placebo) for two 28-day period. Group 2 received placebo for 28 days, followed by tobramycin for two 28-day periods. Pulmonary function, the density of P. aeruginosa in sputum, ototoxicity, nephrotoxicity, and the emergence of tobramycin-resistant P. aeruginosa were monitored.\n                In the first 28-day period, treatment with tobramycin was associated with an increase in the percentage of the value predicted for forced expiratory volume in one second (9.7 percentage points higher than the value for placebo; P < 0.001), forced vital capacity (6.2 percentage points higher than the value for placebo; P = 0.014), and forced expiratory flow at the midportion of the vital capacity (13.0 percentage points higher than the value for placebo; P < 0.001). A decrease in the density of P. aeruginosa in sputum by a factor of 100 (P < 0.001) was found during all periods of tobramycin administration. Neither ototoxicity nor nephrotoxicity was detected. The frequency of the emergence of tobramycin-resistant bacteria was similar during both tobramycin and placebo administration.\n                The short-term aerosol administration of a high dose of tobramycin in patients with clinically stable cystic fibrosis is an efficacious and safe treatment for endobronchial infection with P. aeruginosa.<doc-sep>Intermittent administration of inhaled tobramycin in patients with cystic fibrosis. Cystic Fibrosis Inhaled Tobramycin Study Group.<doc-sep>We conducted two multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials of intermittent administration of inhaled tobramycin in patients with cystic fibrosis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection. A total of 520 patients (mean age, 21 years) were randomly assigned to receive either 300 mg of inhaled tobramycin or placebo twice daily for four weeks, followed by four weeks with no study drug. Patients received treatment or placebo in three on-off cycles for a total of 24 weeks. The end points included pulmonary function, the density of P. aeruginosa in sputum, and hospitalization.\n                The patients treated with inhaled tobramycin had an average increase in forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) of 10 percent at week 20 as compared with week 0, whereas the patients receiving placebo had a 2 percent decline in FEV1 (P<0.001). In the tobramycin group, the density of P. aeruginosa decreased by an average of 0.8 log10 colony-forming units (CFU) per gram of expectorated sputum from week 0 to week 20, as compared with an increase of 0.3 log10 CFU per gram in the placebo group (P<0.001). The patients in the tobramycin group were 26 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 2 to 43 percent) less likely to be hospitalized than those in the placebo group. Inhaled tobramycin was not associated with detectable ototoxic or nephrotoxic effects or with accumulation of the drug in serum. The proportion of patients with P. aeruginosa isolates for which the minimal inhibitory concentration of tobramycin was 8 microg per milliliter or higher increased from 25 percent at week 0 to 32 percent at week 24 in the tobramycin group, as compared with a decrease from 20 percent at week 0 to 17 percent at week 24 in the placebo group.\n                In a 24-week study of patients with cystic fibrosis, intermittent administration of inhaled tobramycin was well tolerated and improved pulmonary function, decreased the density of P. aeruginosa in sputum, and decreased the risk of hospitalization.<doc-sep>Long-term effects of inhaled tobramycin in patients with cystic fibrosis colonized with Pseudomonas aeruginosa.<doc-sep>Twenty-seven patients with cystic fibrosis and endobronchial colonization with Pseudomonas aeruginosa were randomly assigned to inhale either 2 mL saline (12 patients) or 80 mg tobramycin solution (15 patients) 3 times daily. One control patient died; all others completed the study (mean duration 32 months). No significant differences were found between the two groups at enrollment. The treatment group showed no change, while the control group had a significant decline in both pulmonary function and clinical status over the study period. Individually, 11 of 12 patients in the control group showed deterioration, while 9 of 15 in the treatment group with susceptible P. aeruginosa at enrollment acquired resistant organisms. There was no evidence of significant nephro- or ototoxicity. Although inhaled tobramycin appeared to arrest the decline in pulmonary status, further work is required to identify patients most likely to respond.<doc-sep>Treatment with tobramycin solution for inhalation reduces hospitalizations in young CF subjects with mild lung disease.<doc-sep>Our objective was to study the effect of tobramycin solution for inhalation (TSI; TOBI, Chiron Corp.) on lung function decline rate in 400 young persons with cystic fibrosis (CF) and mild lung disease. Effects on hospitalization, antibiotic use, school days missed, and nutritional status also were determined. This was an open-label, randomized (stratified by sex and age group, i.e., 6-10 and 11-15 years), parallel-group, multicenter study. Routine subject management (control group) was compared to routine management plus 28 days of twice-daily TSI inhalation, followed by 28 days off the drug (TSI group) for 56 weeks. Primary efficacy endpoints included rate of lung function decline (as measured by forced expiratory volume in 1 sec; FEV(1)), hospitalization, and concomitant antibiotic use. Safety was assessed by analysis of treatment-emergent adverse events. Only 184 of 400 planned subjects were recruited and randomized (93 to the TSI group, and 91 to the control group). Enrollment was ended after 2 years because of difficult recruitment. An interim safety review showed a 2.42-fold risk of respiratory hospitalization for control group subjects (P = 0.020), and the study was terminated. Sixty-three subjects (34.2%) completed the entire study (30 in the TSI group, or 32.3%; and 33 in the control group, or 36.3%). Significantly fewer TSI subjects were hospitalized for worsening of respiratory symptoms (11.0% vs. 25.6%; P = 0.011), and fewer TSI subjects were hospitalized overall (16.5% vs. 27.8%; P = 0.065). Fewer TSI subjects received antibiotics other than the study drug (78.0% vs. 95.6%), and significantly fewer received oral antibiotics (76.9% vs. 91.1%; P = 0.009). No other safety or adverse event differences were observed. In conclusion, significant reductions in respiratory hospitalizations, concomitant antibiotic use, and a trend towards improvement in percent predicted forced expiratory flow (FEF(25-75)) provide evidence of a clinical benefit of TSI use in young persons with CF and mild lung disease. An effect on lung function decline rate could not be evaluated as planned, due to inadequate enrollment and early study termination.<doc-sep>",

One hundred twelve subjects returned for follow-up 5 to 7 months after enrollment and comprise the study subjects.\n                Subjects completed a multiinstrument questionnaire measuring sexual behavior, condom practices, attitudes and beliefs, cognitive complexity, sociodemographics, and motivation at enrollment and follow-up. Endourethral and endocervical sites were sampled for C. trachomatis.\n                Among the 112 subjects who returned for repeated examination, those who had received the experimental intervention reported increased use of condoms by their sexual partners for protection against sexually transmitted diseases (odds ratio = 2.4; p = 0.02) and for vaginal intercourse (odds ratio = 3.1; p = 0.005) at the 6-month follow-up. Multivariable logistic regression analysis controlling for condom use at enrollment demonstrated that the experimental intervention (odds ratio = 2.8; p = 0.03) and the higher cognitive complexity (odds ratio = 4.6; p = 0.02) independently contributed to greater condom use at follow-up. Despite greater use of condoms among the group who had received the intervention, use remained inconsistent and rates of reinfection with C. trachomatis were not significantly different (26% vs 17%; p = 0.3).\n                Although a brief behavioral intervention among high-risk female adolescents can increase condom use by their sexual partners, incident infection does not appear to be reduced, because condom use remained inconsistent.<doc-sep>The efficacy of female condom skills training in HIV risk reduction among women: a randomized controlled trial.<doc-sep>We evaluated the efficacy of skills training designed to increase female condom use among women.\n                We conducted a randomized controlled trial of 409 women, recruited from family planning clinics in northern California, who were randomly assigned to the experimental 4-session female condom skills training intervention or the comparison 4-session women's general health promotion intervention.

They completed audio computer-assisted self-interviews at baseline and at 3 and 6 months.\n                At 3 and 6 months, women in the experimental group were more likely than those in the comparison group to have used the female condom at least once in the prior 3 months. The increase in the percentage of sexual acts protected by female condoms from baseline to the 6-month follow-up was greater for the experimental group. The percentage of sexual acts during which any condom was employed was higher in the experimental group at 6 months.

The feasibility of the intervention was demonstrated by successfully implementing it with 33 sexually-active, single girls. Preliminary evidence of the efficacy of the intervention was obtained using a randomized trial with 62 sexually-active, single girls. Data obtained at a 3-month follow-up assessment showed that girls who received the HIV-related intervention improved their HIV-related knowledge and enhanced their motivation for risk reduction compared to girls who received a control (health promotion) intervention. Effect sizes suggest that the HIV intervention also reduced several risk behaviors (e.g., vaginal sex without a condom, giving oral sex, and alcohol and drug use before sex).

We conducted structured interviews at baseline (second trimester), third trimester, and 6 and 12 months postpartum.\n                Mean age of participants was 20.4 years; 80% were African American. According to intent-to-treat analyses, women assigned to the HIV-prevention group intervention were significantly less likely to have repeat pregnancy at 6 months postpartum than individual-care and attention-matched controls; they demonstrated increased condom use and decreased unprotected sexual intercourse compared with individual-care and attention-matched controls.

Outcome assessments were made at 6- and 12-month follow-up.\n                All participants received four 4-hour group sessions. The intervention emphasized ethnic and gender pride, HIV knowledge, communication, condom use skills, and healthy relationships. The comparison condition emphasized exercise and nutrition.\n                The primary outcome measure was consistent condom use, defined as condom use during every episode of vaginal intercourse; other outcome measures were sexual behaviors, observed condom application skills, incident STD infection, self-reported pregnancy, and mediators of HIV-preventive behaviors.\n                Relative to the comparison condition, participants in the intervention reported using condoms more consistently in the 30 days preceding the 6-month assessment (unadjusted analysis, intervention, 75.3% vs comparison, 58.2%) and the 12-month assessment (unadjusted analysis, intervention, 73.3% vs comparison, 56.5%) and over the entire 12-month period (adjusted odds ratio, 2.01; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.28-3.17; P =.003).

Findings related to the effects of the intervention on theoretical variables provide some support for selected concepts from Social Cognitive Theory and the Theory of Reasoned Action.<doc-sep>POWER for reproductive health: results from a social marketing campaign promoting female and male condoms.<doc-sep>To evaluate effects of a 6-month social marketing campaign on awareness of, attitudes toward and use of female as well as male condoms for 15-25 year-old-women.\n                Using a time-space sampling methodology, we conducted a cross-sectional survey of 3407 women at pre-campaign in 12 western U.S. neighborhoods on female and male condom awareness, attitudes, and use. Six of the 12 study neighborhoods were randomly selected to receive the POWER social marketing campaign designed to impact condom knowledge, attitudes, and use. The campaign was followed with another cross-sectional survey of 3,003 women in all 12 study neighborhoods on condom knowledge, attitudes, use and awareness of POWER materials. We compared pre-and post-campaign surveys to determine the efficacy of POWER and conducted post hoc analyses on post-campaign data to determine if exposure to POWER was related to higher levels of positive condom attitudes and norms and condom use.\n                We found no differences between neighborhoods with and without the POWER campaign with regard to our primary outcomes. To diagnose reasons for this null effect, we examined outcomes post hoc examining the influence of POWER exposure. Post hoc analyses show some evidence that exposure to POWER was associated with condom use. In the context of the nested trial, this raises concerns that post test only evaluations are limited.\n                Establishing the efficacy of a social marketing campaign is challenging. This group randomized trial showed a null effect. Social marketing campaigns may need to have more media channels and saturation before they can show behavioral effects. Using a nested design with randomization at the community level and probability sampling introduces rigor not commonly seen in evaluations of social marketing campaigns.<doc-sep>Effects of a brief, theory-based STD-prevention program for female college students.<doc-sep>To evaluate a brief, theoretically guided sexually transmitted disease (STD) risk-reduction intervention tailored to college-aged women.\n                The participants were 78 undergraduate females (M = 20 years; 76% European-American) who reported inconsistent condom use or multiple sexual partners. Participants were randomly assigned to one of three groups: (a) a one-session intervention based on the information-motivation-behavioral skills (IMB) model, (b) a one-session information-only intervention (INFO), or (c) a wait-list control (WLC) group. Consistent with Fisher and Fisher's (1992) IMB model, we predicted that risk reduction would be greater when information about HIV was supplemented with motivational enhancement strategies and skills training. To evaluate this hypothesis, groups were compared at the post-intervention assessment and at a 2-month follow-up using analyses of covariance and log odds ratios.\n                At the post-intervention assessment, the IMB and INFO groups demonstrated increased STD-related knowledge. At 2-month follow-up, the IMB and INFO groups showed sustained STD-related knowledge, and the IMB group showed reductions in number of sexual partners compared to the WLC group.\n                These results provide partial support for the hypothesis that an IMB model-based intervention leads to reductions in sexual risk behavior and suggest directions for future research.<doc-sep>Evaluation of a cognitive-behavioral, group, randomized controlled intervention trial to prevent sexually transmitted infections and unintended pregnancies in young women.<doc-sep>Few cognitive-behavioral interventions have focused on preventing sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and unintended pregnancies (UPs) in young, sexually active women in a single study. Military recruit training provides a well-defined, national, nonclinic sample in which to evaluate such an intervention.\n                All female Marine recruits (N=2,288) in training were approached. Of these, 2,157 (94.3%) voluntarily agreed and were randomly assigned, by platoons, to participate in cognitive-behavioral interventions to prevent STIs or UPs or to prevent physical training injuries and cancer. Participants completed self-administered questionnaires and were screened for pregnancy, Chlamydia trachomatis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, and Trichomonas vaginalis at baseline and, on average, 1 and 14 months postintervention.\n                A higher proportion of the control group had a postintervention STI or UP [odds ratio (OR)=1.41, 95% confidence interval (CI)=1.01-1.98]. Among participants who had no history of STIs or pregnancy, but who engaged in risky sexual behaviors just before recruit training, the control group was more likely to acquire a postintervention STI (OR=3.24, CI=1.74-6.03). Among participants who were not sexually experienced at baseline, the control group was more likely to have casual (OR=2.05, 95% CI=1.04-4.08) and multiple (OR=1.87, 95% CI=1.01-3.47) sexual partners postintervention.\n                This randomized controlled trial indicates that cognitive-behavioral interventions are effective for reducing behavioral risk and preventing STIs and UPs in young, sexually active women who are not seeking health care.<doc-sep>Randomized controlled trial of a safer sex intervention for high-risk adolescent girls.<doc-sep>To determine the effect of an individualized safer sex intervention on condom use and recurrent sexually transmitted disease (STD) among female adolescents diagnosed as having an STD.\n                Randomized controlled trial.\n                Urban children's hospital adolescent clinic and inpatient service.\n                One hundred twenty-three adolescents with cervicitis or pelvic inflammatory disease.\n                Participants completed a questionnaire and then were randomized to receive standard STD education or to watch a videotape and have an individualized intervention session. Follow-up questionnaires were completed at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months. Intervention participants met with an educator at 1, 3, and 6 months to discuss interim sexual history and review the intervention.\n                Change in self-reported condom use and recurrence of STD. Other self-reported behaviors, sexual risk knowledge, attitudes toward condoms, and condom use negotiation skills were also assessed.\n                At 1 month, compared with control participants, intervention participants had increased sexual risk knowledge and more positive attitudes toward condoms and tended to use condoms more with a nonmain partner. At 6 months, fewer intervention participants than controls had sex with a nonmain sexual partner in the previous 6 months. At 12 months, intervention participants were less likely to have a current main partner and had a lower rate of recurrent STD than controls, but these differences were not significant.\n                This individualized safer sex intervention may improve condom use and decrease the number of partners among adolescent girls who have had an STD. Studies with larger samples are needed to determine definitive intervention effects on recurrent STD in this high-risk population.<doc-sep>Tailored intervention to increase dual-contraceptive method use: a randomized trial to reduce unintended pregnancies and sexually transmitted infections.<doc-sep>The objective of the study was to determine whether a transtheoretical model-tailored expert system intervention increases dual-method contraceptive use, compared with a nontailored educational intervention.\n                We performed a randomized clinical trial of 542 women at high risk for sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and unintended pregnancy. The intervention group received computer-based tailored feedback using a multimedia program. The control group received general contraceptive information and nontailored advice.\n                Participants in the intervention group were more likely to report use of dual contraceptive methods during follow-up (adjusted hazard rate ratio 1.70, 95% confidence interval 1.09, 2.66), compared with controls. However, there were no differences in the rates of incident STI or unintended pregnancy between the 2 groups.\n                The computer-based transtheoretical model-tailored intervention resulted in a 70% increase in reported dual-method contraceptive use in a group of women at high risk for STIs and unintended pregnancy. Inconsistent use of dual methods may explain the lack of effect on unintended pregnancy rates and incident STIs.<doc-sep>A brief, low-cost, theory-based intervention to promote dual method use by black and Latina female adolescents: a randomized clinical trial.<doc-sep>HIV/AIDS disproportionately affects young women of color. Young women who use hormonal contraception are less likely to use condoms. Brief, inexpensive HIV-prevention interventions are needed for high-volume clinics. This study was a randomized clinical trial of two interventions: (a) a video made for this study and (b) an adaptation of Project RESPECT counseling. Four hundred Black and Latina teenage women completed a questionnaire about their sexual behaviors and were randomly assigned to (a) see the video, (b) get counseling, (c) see the video and get counseling, or (d) receive usual care. At 3-month follow-up, those who saw the video and received counseling were 2.5 times more likely to have used a condom at last intercourse with their main partner than teens in the usual care group. These differences did not persist at 12-month follow-up. This suggests that a brief intervention can positively affect condom use in the short term.<doc-sep>Interactive video behavioral intervention to reduce adolescent females' STD risk: a randomized controlled trial.<doc-sep>A longitudinal randomized design was used to evaluate the impact of a theoretically based, stand-alone interactive video intervention on 300 urban adolescent girls' (a) knowledge about sexually transmitted diseases (STDs), (b) self-reported sexual risk behavior, and (c) STD acquisition. It was compared to two controls, representing high-quality informational interventions. One used the same content in book form; the other used commercially available brochures. Following randomization, the interventions were administered at baseline, with booster sessions at 1, 3, and 6 months. Self-reports revealed that those assigned to the interactive video were significantly more likely to be abstinent in the first 3 months following initial exposure to the intervention, and experienced fewer condom failures in the following 3 months, compared to controls. Six months after enrollment, participants in the video condition were significantly less likely to report having been diagnosed with an STD. A non-significant trend in data from a clinical PCR assay of Chlamydia trachomatis was consistent with that finding.<doc-sep>",
         "Behavioural interventions for young women which aim to promote sexual behaviours protective of STI transmission can be effective, primarily at encouraging condom use. Future evaluations should include a greater focus on HPV and its link to cervical cancer, with long-term follow-up to assess impact on behaviour change, rates of HPV infection and progression to cervical cancer. Studies should use an RCT design where possible with integral process evaluation and cost-effectiveness analysis where appropriate.

         "Screening elderly people in primary care: a randomized controlled trial.<doc-sep>A randomized controlled trial was carried out to test the effectiveness of a screening programme carried out by nurses for elderly people aged 75 years and over in a general practice. A total of 151 people were randomly allocated to the test group and 145 to the control group. The test group received a home visit from a nurse at which an assessment lasting 45 minutes was made of: activities of daily living, social functioning, sensory functions, mental and emotional problems, current medical problems, blood pressure, urinalysis, haemoglobin level and compliance with medication. Both groups completed a selection of items from four health indices before and 20 months after the intervention. At follow up, the test group scored significantly better than the control group on a morale scale. However, this trial provided no evidence for better resolution of physical problems or finding activities of daily living easier in the test group compared with the control group. It is suggested that the main benefit of such a screening process is that the special attention and education provided improves adaptation to old age and awareness of the support systems available. The government has proposed an annual review of elderly people in their own home and this study suggests that the objectives of this scheme should be clarified.<doc-sep>Screening older people for impaired vision in primary care: cluster randomised trial.<doc-sep>To determine the effectiveness of screening for visual impairment in people aged 75 or over as part of a multidimensional screening programme.\n                Cluster randomised trial.\n                General practices in the United Kingdom participating in the MRC trial of assessment and management of older people in the community.\n                4340 people aged 75 years or over randomly sampled from 20 general practices, excluding people resident in hospitals or nursing homes.\n                Visual acuity testing and referral to eye services for people with visual impairment. Universal screening (assessment and visual acuity testing) was compared with targeted screening, in which only participants with a range of health related problems were offered an assessment that included acuity screening.\n                Proportion of people with visual acuity less than 6/18 in either eye; mean composite score of 25 item version of the National Eye Institute visual function questionnaire.\n                Three to five years after screening, the relative risk of having visual acuity < 6/18 in either eye, comparing universal with targeted screening, was 1.07 (95% confidence interval 0.84 to 1.36; P = 0.58). The mean composite score of the visual function questionnaire was 85.6 in the targeted screening group and 86.0 in the universal group (difference 0.4, 95% confidence interval -1.7 to 2.5, P = 0.69).\n                Including a vision screening component by a practice nurse in a pragmatic trial of multidimensional screening for older people did not lead to improved visual outcomes.<doc-sep>Preventing disability and falls in older adults: a population-based randomized trial.<doc-sep>Because preventing disability and falls in older adults is a national priority, a randomized controlled trial was conducted to test a multicomponent intervention program.\n                From a random sample of health maintenance organization (HMO) enrollees 65 years and older, 1559 ambulatory seniors were randomized to one of three groups: a nurse assessment visit and follow-up interventions targeting risk factors for disability and falls (group 1, n = 635); a general health promotion nurse visit (group 2, n = 317); and usual care (group 3, n = 607). Data collection consisted of a baseline and two annual follow-up surveys.\n                After 1 year, group 1 subjects reported a significantly lower incidence of declining functional status and a significantly lower incidence of falls than group 3 subjects. Group 2 subjects had intermediate levels of most outcomes. After 2 years of follow-up, the differences narrowed.\n                The results suggest that a modest, one-time prevention program appeared to confer short-term health benefits on ambulatory HMO enrollees, although benefits diminished by the second year of follow-up. The mechanisms by which the intervention may have improved outcomes require further investigation.<doc-sep>Can health visitors prevent fractures in elderly people?<doc-sep>To assess whether intervention by a health visitor could reduce the number of fractures, over a four year period, in those aged 70 and over.\n                Randomised, controlled trial; randomisation by household.\n                General practice in a market town.\n                Of 863 patients aged 70 and over on the practice records, 674 were traced and successfully interviewed; 350 were assigned to the intervention group, 324 as controls.\n                The people in the intervention group were allocated to the care of a health visitor. The approach was four pronged: assessment and correction of nutritional deficiencies, including reducing smoking and alcohol intake; assessment and referral of medical conditions such as heart block or inappropriate medication; assessment and correction of environmental hazards in the home such as poor lighting; assessment and improvement of fitness--for example, exercise classes for the moderately fit. The intervention continued for four years.\n                Fracture rate over four years.\n                The incidence of fractures was 5% (16/350) in the intervention group and 4% (14/324) in the control group (difference not significant).\n                A health visitor visiting a group of people aged 70 and over and using simple preventive measures had no effect on the incidence of fractures.<doc-sep>Effect of health visitors working with elderly patients in general practice: a randomised controlled trial.<doc-sep>Health visitors were employed specifically to care for two years for a random sample of patients in general practice who were aged over 70. Independent assessments made at the beginning and end of the study showed that the health visitor in an urban practice had some impact on her caseload of patients; she provided more services for them, their mortality was reduced, and their quality of life improved, though the last measure just failed to be statistically significant.

No differences were found in long term institutional care, and overall expenditure per person in the intervention group exceeded that in the control group by 4%. Additional analyses showed that visits were effective for subjects who initially rated their health as poor.\n                Preventive home visits are not beneficial for the general population of elderly people living at home but might be effective when restricted to subjects with poor health.<doc-sep>",

The three treatment programs were: Integrated Assertive Community Treatment (IACT), Assertive Community Treatment only (ACTO), and standard care (Control). Participants were randomly assigned to treatment and followed for a period of 24 months. Clients in the IACT and ACTO programs were more satisfied with their treatment program and reported more days in stable housing than clients in the Control condition. There were no significant differences between treatment groups on psychiatric symptoms and substance use. The average total costs associated with the IACT and Control conditions were significantly less than the average total costs for the ACTO condition.<doc-sep>Comparison of ACT and standard case management for delivering integrated treatment for co-occurring disorders.<doc-sep>Clients with co-occurring severe mental and substance use disorders are at high risk of institutionalization and other adverse outcomes. Although integrated mental health and substance abuse treatment is becoming a standard clinical approach for such clients, the optimal method for delivering integrated treatment remains unclear.\n                This study compared integrated treatment delivered within two different models of community-based case management (assertive community treatment and standard clinical case management). A total of 198 clients in two urban sites who had co-occurring disorders and were homeless or unstably housed were randomly assigned to one of two treatment conditions and were followed for three years.\n                Participants in both treatment conditions improved over time in multiple outcome domains, and few differences were found between the two models. Decreases in substance use were greater than would be expected given time alone. At the site that had higher rates of institutionalization, clients who received standard case management were more likely to be institutionalized. However, in the site that had lower rates of institutionalization, no differences in the rate of institutionalization were found between the two treatment conditions.\n                Integrated treatment can be successfully delivered either by assertive community treatment or by standard clinical case management.<doc-sep>A randomized clinical trial of a new behavioral treatment for drug abuse in people with severe and persistent mental illness.<doc-sep>Drug abuse by people with severe mental disorder is a significant public health problem for which there is no empirically validated treatment.\n                To evaluate the efficacy of a new behavioral treatment for drug abuse in this population: Behavioral Treatment for Substance Abuse in Severe and Persistent Mental Illness (BTSAS).\n                Participants were randomly assigned to 6 months of treatment in either BTSAS or a manualized control condition: Supportive Treatment for Addiction Recovery (STAR).\n                Treatment was conducted in community-based outpatient clinics and a Veterans Affairs medical center in Baltimore, Md.\n                Participants were 129 stabilized outpatients meeting DSM criteria for drug dependence (cocaine, heroin, or cannabis) and serious mental illness: 39.5% met DSM-IV criteria for schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder; 55.8%, for major affective disorders; and the remainder met criteria for severe and persistent mental illness and other Axis I disorders.\n                Both treatments were administered by trained health care professionals in small groups, twice a week for 6 months. The BTSAS program is a social learning intervention that includes motivational interviewing, a urinalysis contingency, and social skills training. The control condition, STAR, is a supportive group discussion treatment. Main Outcome Measure The primary outcome measure was urinalysis results from twice-weekly treatment sessions.\n                The BTSAS program was significantly more effective than STAR in percentage of clean urine test results, survival in treatment, and attendance at sessions. The BTSAS program also had significant effects on important community-functioning variables, including hospitalization; money available for living expenses; and quality of life.\n                The BTSAS program is an efficacious treatment.

Using clinical trial methods, 132 dually diagnosed clients were assigned to three service approaches. Changes in client psychosocial outcomes, and psychiatric and substance abuse symptomatology were tracked over a 24-month period. Differential effectiveness was evident, with clients in the behavioral skills group demonstrating the most positive and significant differences in psychosocial functioning and symptomatology, compared with the Twelve Step recovery approach. However, the case management intervention also resulted in several positive and important differences compared with the Twelve Step recovery approach. We also found significant changes over time, not only at 6 months but increasingly positive changes in psychosocial functioning at 12 and 18 months as well. These results underscore the need for clinical trials to further examine the relative cost effectiveness of treatment approaches for dually disordered clients and to incorporate means of assessing subgroup differences so that the interventions being tested can be further refined and targeted to a broad set of needs among the dually diagnosed.<doc-sep>Cognitive behavior therapy for schizophrenia in patients with mild to moderate substance misuse problems.<doc-sep><doc-sep>Rehabilitation for adults with severe mental illness and substance use disorders.

Fifty-four patients, age 18 to 40, with either schizophrenia or major affective disorder and a substance use disorder were randomly assigned to usual community mental health center and rehabilitation services with or without an innovative group and intensive case management program. One-year follow-ups detected no significant advantages on patient outcomes for adding the innovative program to usual services.

Outcomes were tracked an average of 18 months from program entry at the termination of the initial incarceration. A reduction in jail days from baseline to study period was significant for both groups. The pre to post reduction for arrests and total convictions was significant in the experimental group but not the control group. However, during the study period, differences between experimental and control groups in arrests, convictions and jail days were not statistically significant. Experimental participants had lower study period psychiatric inpatient and crisis utilization and greater outpatient utilization than did control group participants. The groups did not differ with regard to total institutional days. Experimental group attrition was relatively high.<doc-sep>Motivational interviewing and treatment adherence among psychiatric and dually diagnosed patients.<doc-sep>The effect of motivational interviewing on outpatient treatment adherence among psychiatric and dually diagnosed inpatients was investigated. Subjects were 121 psychiatric inpatients, 93 (77%) of whom had concomitant substance abuse/dependence disorders, who were randomly assigned to: a) standard treatment (ST), including pharmacotherapy, individual and group psychotherapy, activities therapy, milieu treatment, and discharge planning; or b) ST plus motivational interviewing (ST+MI), which involved 15 minutes of feedback on the results of a motivational assessment early in the hospitalization, and a 1-hour motivational interview just before discharge. Interviewers utilized motivational techniques described in Miller and Rollnick (1991), such as reflective listening, discussion of treatment obstacles, and elicitation of motivational statements. Results indicated that the proportion of patients who attended their first outpatient appointment was significantly higher for the ST+MI group (47%) than for the ST group (21%; chi2 = 8.87, df = 1, p<.01) overall, and for dually diagnosed patients (42% for ST+MI vs. 16% for ST only; chi2 = 7.68, df = 1, p<.01).

A single-blind randomized controlled trial compared CAP (n = 23) with a clinical control condition (psychoeducation, PE; n = 24). There were no significant differences between the CAP and PE groups on cannabis use at end of treatment and 6 months post-intervention.\n                There were no significant group differences on psychopathology and functional ratings at follow-up. A significant reduction in cannabis use was observed for both groups over time.\n                PE and specific cannabis-focused intervention are associated with similar reductions in cannabis use in an FEP cohort. Simple interventions may therefore be worth considering prior to intensive psychotherapeutic efforts with this population.<doc-sep>Assertive community treatment for patients with co-occurring severe mental illness and substance use disorder: a clinical trial.<doc-sep>Integrated mental health and substance abuse treatment within an assertive community treatment (ACT) approach was compared to that within a standard case management approach for 223 patients with dual disorders over three years. ACT patients showed greater improvements on some measures of substance abuse and quality of life, but the groups were equivalent on most measures, including stable community days, hospital days, psychiatric symptoms, and remission of substance use disorder.<doc-sep>A randomized trial of integrated group therapy versus group drug counseling for patients with bipolar disorder and substance dependence.<doc-sep>Although bipolar disorder and substance use disorder frequently co-occur, there is little information on the effectiveness of behavioral treatment for this population. Integrated group therapy, which addresses the two disorders simultaneously, was compared with group drug counseling, which focuses on substance use. The authors hypothesized that patients receiving integrated group therapy would have fewer days of substance use and fewer weeks ill with bipolar disorder.\n                A randomized controlled trial compared 20 weeks of integrated group therapy or group drug counseling with 3 months of posttreatment follow-up. Sixty-two patients with bipolar disorder and current substance dependence, treated with mood stabilizers for >or=2 weeks, were randomly assigned to integrated group therapy (N=31) or group drug counseling (N=31). The primary outcome measure was the number of days of substance use. The primary mood outcome was the number of weeks ill with a mood episode.\n                Intention-to-treat analysis revealed significantly fewer days of substance use for integrated group therapy patients during treatment and follow-up. Groups were similar in the number of weeks ill with bipolar disorder during treatment and follow-up, although integrated group therapy patients had more depressive and manic symptoms.\n                Integrated group therapy, a new treatment developed specifically for patients with bipolar disorder and substance dependence, appears to be a promising approach to reduce substance use in this population.<doc-sep>Evaluation of a motivational interview for substance use within psychiatric in-patient services.<doc-sep>To assess the effectiveness of a motivational interview among hospitalized psychiatric patients with comorbid substance use disorder in reducing alcohol and other drug (AOD) use.\n                Subjects were assigned randomly to receive an individual motivational interview (n=79) or a self-help booklet (control condition; n=81).\n                Subjects were volunteers recruited from a major public psychiatric hospital.\n                Subjects met abuse or dependence criteria on the structured clinical interview for diagnosis (SCID) for alcohol, cannabis or amphetamine or they reported hazardous use during the last month of one or more of these drug types on the opiate treatment index (OTI).\n                Either one 30-45-minute motivational interview or brief advice.\n                The SCID and OTI were the main measures.\n                There was a modest short-term effect of the motivational interview on an aggregate index of alcohol and other drug use (polydrug use on the OTI). Cannabis use remained high among the sample over the 12-month follow-up period.\n                Although motivational interviewing appears feasible among in-patients in psychiatric hospital with comorbid substance use disorders, more extensive interventions are recommended, continuing on an out-patient basis, particularly for cannabis use.<doc-sep>An experimental evaluation of residential and nonresidential treatment for dually diagnosed homeless adults.<doc-sep>Homeless adults with both a serious mental illness and substance dependence (N = 276) were randomly assigned to: (1) a social model residential program providing integrated mental health and substance abuse treatment; (2) a community-based nonresidential program using the same social model approach; or (3) a control group receiving no intervention but free to access other community services. Interventions were designed to provide 3 months of intensive treatment, followed by 3 months of nonresidential maintenance. Subjects completed baseline interviews prior to randomization and reinterviews 3, 6, and 9 months later. Results showed that, while substance use, mental health, and housing outcomes improved from baseline, subjects assigned to treatment conditions differed little from control subjects. Examination of the relationship between length of treatment exposure and outcomes suggested that residential treatment had positive effects on outcomes at 3 months, but that these effects were eroded by 6 months.<doc-sep>A brief motivational intervention for substance misuse in recent-onset psychosis.<doc-sep>Substance misuse is common in early psychosis, and impacts negatively on outcomes. Little is known about effective interventions for this population. We report a pilot study of brief intervention for substance misuse in early psychosis (Start Over and Survive: SOS), comparing it with Standard Care (SC). Twenty-five in-patients aged 18-35 years with early psychosis and current misuse of non-opioid drugs were allocated randomly to conditions. Substance use and related problems were assessed at baseline, 6 weeks and 3, 6 and 12 months. Final assessments were blind to condition. All 13 SOS participants who proceeded to motivational interviewing reported less substance use at 6 months, compared with 58% (7/12) in SC alone. Effects were well maintained to 12 months. However, more SOS participants lived with a relative or partner, and this also was associated with better outcomes. Engagement remained challenging: 39% (16/41) declined participation and 38% (5/13) in SOS only received rapport building. Further research will increase sample size, and address both engagement and potential confounds.<doc-sep>Cognitive-behavioural therapy for substance use disorders in people with psychotic disorders: Randomised controlled trial.<doc-sep>Few randomised controlled trials have been aimed specifically at substance use reduction among people with psychotic disorders.\n                To investigate whether a 10-session intervention consisting of motivational interviewing and cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT) was more efficacious than routine treatment in reducing substance use and improving symptomatology and general functioning.\n                A community sample of people with a psychotic disorder and who reported hazardous alcohol, cannabis and/or amphetamine use during the preceding month was recruited. Participants were randomly allocated to motivational interviewing/CBT (n = 65) or treatment as usual (n = 65), and were assessed on multiple outcomes at baseline, 15 weeks, 6 months and 12 months.\n                There was a short-term improvement in depression and a similar trend with regard to cannabis use among participants who received the motivational interviewing/CBT intervention, together with effects on general functioning at 12 months. There was no differential benefit of the intervention on substance use at 12 months, except for a potentially clinically important effect on amphetamine use.\n                The motivational interviewing/CBT intervention was associated with modest improvements.<doc-sep>Randomized controlled trial of motivational interviewing, cognitive behavior therapy, and family intervention for patients with comorbid schizophrenia and substance use disorders.<doc-sep>Comorbidity of substance abuse disorders with schizophrenia is associated with a greater risk for serious illness complications and poorer outcome. Methodologically sound studies investigating treatment approaches for patients with these disorders are rare, although recommendations for integrated and comprehensive treatment programs abound. This study investigates the relative benefit of adding an integrated psychological and psychosocial treatment program to routine psychiatric care for patients with schizophrenia and substance use disorders.\n                The authors conducted a randomized, single-blind controlled comparison of routine care with a program of routine care integrated with motivational interviewing, cognitive behavior therapy, and family or caregiver intervention.\n                The integrated treatment program resulted in significantly greater improvement in patients' general functioning than routine care alone at the end of treatment and 12 months after the beginning of the study. Other benefits of the program included a reduction in positive symptoms and in symptom exacerbations and an increase in the percent of days of abstinence from drugs or alcohol over the 12-month period from baseline to follow-up.\n                These findings demonstrate the effectiveness of a program of routine care integrated with motivational interviewing, cognitive behavior therapy, and family intervention over routine psychiatric care alone for patients with comorbid schizophrenia and alcohol or drug abuse or dependence.<doc-sep>",

Subjects received 400 mg of itraconazole per day (n = 15) or placebo (n = 14) for 16 weeks. All subjects were reviewed monthly with history, spirometry, and sputum induction to measure airway inflammation, serum total IgE and IgG levels to A fumigatu s, and blood eosinophil counts.\n                By using regression analysis in a random-effects model, subjects receiving itraconazole had a decrease in sputum eosinophils of 35% per week, with no decrease seen in the placebo arm (P <.01). Sputum eosinophil cationic protein levels decreased with itraconazole treatment by 42% per week compared with 23% in the placebo group (P <.01). Itraconazole reduced systemic immune activation, leading to a decrease in serum IgE levels (310 IU/mL) compared with levels seen in the placebo group (increase of 18 IU/mL, P <.01) and a decrease in IgG levels to A fumigatu s (15.4 IU/mL) compared with levels seen in the placebo group (increase of 3.7 IU/mL, P =.03). There were fewer exacerbations requiring oral cortico-steroids in those treated with itraconazole compared with in the placebo group (P =.03).\n                Itraconazole treatment of subjects with stable ABPA reduces eosinophilic airway inflammation, systemic immune activation, and exacerbations. These results imply that itraconazole is a potential adjunctive treatment for ABPA.<doc-sep>Trial of ketoconazole in non-invasive pulmonary aspergillosis.<doc-sep>A one year study of the efficacy of the antifungal agent ketoconazole in non-invasive pulmonary aspergillosis was carried out. Ten patients, seven with allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis and three with mycetoma, were studied. They were randomly allocated to receive 400 mg daily or placebo orally in a double blind fashion. In the treated group (n = 6), concentrations of serum IgG specific for Aspergillus fumigatus fell significantly during treatment (mean reduction 42% (SEM 2.2%) compared with determinations preceding the study). This effect was evident by three months and continued for the 12 months of treatment. Patients receiving placebo (n = 4) showed no significant change in serum IgG concentration (mean change + 10% (SEM 5.3%].

A response was defined as a reduction of at least 50 percent in the corticosteroid dose, a decrease of at least 25 percent in the serum IgE concentration, and one of the following: an improvement of at least 25 percent in exercise tolerance or pulmonary-function tests or resolution or absence of pulmonary infiltrates. In a second, open-label part of the trial, all the patients received 200 mg of itraconazole per day for 16 weeks.\n                There were responses in 13 of 28 patients in the itraconazole group (46 percent), as compared with 5 of 27 patients in the placebo group (19 percent, P=0.04).

         "Comparison of four different treatment regimes in hirsutism related to polycystic ovary syndrome.<doc-sep>Polycystic ovary syndrome is the most common endocrinological problem associated with hirsutism. The objective of this study was to compare four different treatment modalities for hirsutism related to this syndrome. Pelvic ultrasonography was performed on all patients who were referred to our Reproductive Endocrinology Outpatient Clinic because of complaints of hirsutism. After exclusion of hyperandrogenism caused by endocrine abnormalities other than polycystic ovary syndrome, 141 patients were included in the study. Patients were divided into four groups in regard to the drug chosen for treatment. Group 1 (n = 48) received low-dose combined oral contraceptive. Group 2 (n = 65) was treated with cyproterone acetate 100 mg daily for the first 10 days of a 21-day cycle with an oral contraceptive containing 2 mg cyproterone acetate, Group 3 (n = 12) with spironolactone (100-200 mg daily) and Group 4 (n = 16) with ketoconazole (400 mg daily). All patients were followed frequently with respect to side-effects, hirsutism scoring, and lipid and hormonal levels. All four drug regimens were effective in the treatment of hirsutism related to polycystic ovary syndrome, but the most effective seemed to be ketoconazole. The decrement level in hirsutism scoring was the largest in the ketoconazole group, followed by the cyproterone, oral contraceptive and spironolactone groups (34.6 +/- 2.2%, 20.1 +/- 2.7%, 18.1 +/- 2.7% and 12.8 +/- 3.7%, respectively, p < 0.05). Although high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol levels increased in all groups, this increment was smaller in Group 4 than in Groups 1 and 2 (5.1 +/- 2.8%, 34.1 +/- 5.5% and 29.1 +/- 4.9%, respectively, p < 0.05), but not statistically different from that in Group 3 (22.3 +/- 5.9%). The free testosterone levels decreased after treatment in all groups, but the decrement ratios did not differ significantly among groups, although the decrease in free testosterone levels with treatment seemed to be higher in the ketoconazole group than in Groups 1, 2 and 3 (57.0 +/- 2.5%, 22.7 +/- 10.2%, 26.7 +/- 6.5% and 9.5 +/- 19.9%, respectively). In conclusion, ketoconazole seems to be an excellent alternative to more-recognized therapies, but its effect on lipoprotein profile requires further study, because the hyperandrogenism, and the other problems related to hyperandrogenism besides hirsutism, should also be treated.<doc-sep>Treatment of hirsutism: comparisons between different antiandrogens with central and peripheral effects.<doc-sep>To compare the clinical and endocrinologic effects of cyproterone acetate (CPA), an antiandrogen with progestational activity; flutamide, a nonsteroidal antiandrogen, and finasteride, an inhibitor of 5alpha-reductase.\n                Randomized, open, controlled clinical study.\n                Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, University of Pisa, Pisa, Italy.\n                Forty-five hirsute women were enrolled in the study: 29 were hyperandrogenic and 16 had idiopathic hirsutism. Three women dropped out of the study.\n                Women were randomly treated with finasteride (5 mg/d; n = 14), CPA (25 mg plus ethinyl E2 (EE); n = 13), or flutamide (500 mg/d; n = 15) for 1 year.\n                Hirsutism was assessed using the Ferriman-Gallwey method. Levels of total and free T, androstenedione (A), DHEAS, sex hormone-binding globulin, dihydrotestosterone, and 3alpha-androstanediol glucuronide were evaluated at the beginning of the study and every 3 months.\n                Treatment with finasteride, flutamide, and CPA significantly decreased the Ferriman-Gallwey score. The percent decreases in the hirsutism score induced by the different treatments were similar. Treatment with CPA plus EE significantly decreased levels of total and free T, A, dihydrotestosterone, and 3alpha-androstanediol glucuronide. These parameters were unchanged with flutamide therapy. Finasteride significantly increased total T levels but reduced dihydrotestosterone and 3alpha-androstanediol glucuronide concentrations.\n                Finasteride, CPA, and flutamide are equally effective in decreasing hirsutism, despite different mechanisms of action.<doc-sep>Comparison of flutamide and cyproterone acetate in the treatment of hirsutism: a randomized controlled trial.<doc-sep>The objective of this study was to compare the efficacy of flutamide and cyproterone acetate in the treatment of hirsutism. Twenty-two women with idiopathic hirsutism were randomized to receive either flutamide or cyproterone acetate. Each patient underwent a complete gynecological examination as well as an endocrinological profile and hematological, hepatic and renal function analyses. Hirsutism scores were determined using a modified Ferriman-Gallwey scoring system. These tests were then repeated at 3 and 9 months of therapy. Eleven patients received 250 mg of flutamide twice daily and 11 patients received 100 mg of cyproterone acetate on days 5-14 of the menstrual cycle. Ferriman-Gallwey scores were decreased significantly in both groups at the end of 9 months. There was a trend towards a better response with flutamide, that did not achieve significance. Another significant difference was the increased sex hormone-binding globulin in both groups. A statistically significant decrease was also observed for the levels of testosterone on both drugs. No subject withdrew from the study due to a side-effect. The data suggest that both flutamide and cyproterone acetate were similarly effective in treatment of hirsutism, and that the pure antiandrogen flutamide is a safe, well-tolerated and effective alternative in treatment.<doc-sep>Comparison of spironolactone-oral contraceptive versus cyproterone acetate-estrogen regimens in the treatment of hirsutism.<doc-sep>To compare the efficacy of two antiandrogens, cyproterone acetate (CPA) and spironolactone, in the treatment of hirsutism.\n                Prospective randomized single-blinded study.\n                A tertiary hirsutism clinic.\n                Forty-two premenopausal patients with hirsutism were selected.\n                Subjects were randomized to receive either 100 mg spironolactone and an oral contraceptive (OC) containing 150 microg desogestrel and 30 microg ethinyl E2 or 50 mg CPA daily on days 1 to 10 of the menstrual cycle, which was administered with 35 microg ethinyl E2 daily on days 1 to 21.\n                Hirsutism scores were measured according to Ferriman-Gallwey scoring system and side effects were monitored for 9 months of treatment. Blood samples were taken at each visit for assessment of endocrine, biochemical, and hematologic parameters.\n                Hirsutism scores were decreaded significantly in both groups at the end of 9 months. The percent of change in hirsutism scores in CPA and spironolactone group were as follows: 19.23% +/- 14.77% and 24.48% +/- 14.27% at 3 months; 39.01% +/- 19.77% and 37.46% +/- 16.90% at 6 months; and 51.89% +/- 20.87% and 46.39% +/- 16.10% at 9 months, respectively. There was a trend toward a better response with CPA treatment, which did not achieve significance. None of the patients stopped treatment because of side effects.\n                The present data suggest that both spironolactone and CPA were similarly effective in treatment of hirsutism.<doc-sep>Comparison of sequential cyproterone acetate/estrogen versus spironolactone/oral contraceptive in the treatment of hirsutism.<doc-sep>The effects of the antiandrogen drugs cyproterone acetate (CPA) and spironolactone on hair growth and androgen levels were compared in a randomized study of 48 hirsute women. Twenty six subjects completed 6 months of therapy with 100 mg/day CPA and 19 subjects completed 6 months of 100 mg/day spironolactone. All except 10 subjects received concomitant estrogen therapy. Measured objectively, total hair diameter fell by 17.1% with spironolactone (P less than 0.001), and by 16.8% with CPA (P less than 0.001). The diameter of the hair medulla fell by 17.8% with spironolactone (P less than 0.01), and by 31.7% with CPA (P less than 0.001). There was no difference between the drugs in their effect on hair diameter. Plasma testosterone levels also fell significantly with both drugs. As a subjective assessment of treatment efficacy, the frequency with which subjects performed cosmetic measures was recorded. This fell by 38% with spironolactone and by 44.7% with CPA (P less than 0.001 both drugs), and again there was no difference between the drugs. Side effects caused cessation of treatment in one subject taking CPA and two subjects taking spironolactone, and milder side effects were noted in two further subjects from each treatment group. We conclude that spironolactone and CPA, in the dosages used in this study, are effective and well tolerated agents for the treatment of hirsutism, and that neither drug demonstrates a particular advantage over the other.<doc-sep>Prospective randomized study comparing the long-acting gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist triptorelin, flutamide, and cyproterone acetate, used in combination with an oral contraceptive, in the treatment of hirsutism.<doc-sep>To compare triptorelin, cyproterone acetate (CPA), and flutamide, in combination with an oral contraceptive, in the treatment of hirsutism.\n                Prospective randomized study.\n                Tertiary care hospital.\n                Thirty-nine hirsute women with idiopathic or functional ovarian hyperandrogenism.\n                Patients were randomly assigned to receive triptorelin (3.75 mg IM every 28 days), CPA (100 mg/d orally on days 1-10 of the menstrual cycle), or flutamide (250 mg orally twice daily). All the patients also received a triphasic oral contraceptive.\n                Before and after 3 and 9 months of treatment, the Ferriman-Gallwey score, hepatic function, and gonadal and adrenal steroid profiles were evaluated.\n                Thirty-three patients completed the 9-month study period. The Ferriman-Gallwey score decreased in all the groups. In the patients treated with CPA or flutamide, a decrease in the hirsutism score was noted as soon as after 3 months of treatment. This decrease was more pronounced after 9 months of treatment, especially in the patients who received flutamide, who had lower hirsutism scores compared with the other treatment groups. None of the patients had abnormal liver function test results. There was a mild increase in serum lipid concentrations, mostly in the group treated with triptorelin.\n                Triptorelin, CPA, and flutamide are effective drugs for the treatment of hirsutism. Flutamide results in a greater reduction in the hirsutism score, but CPA also offers satisfactory results at a much lower cost. Triptorelin has no advantages over flutamide and CPA, and is the most expensive of the three drugs tested.<doc-sep>Comparative effects of cyproterone acetate or a long-acting gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist in polycystic ovarian disease.<doc-sep>A randomized cross-over study was done to compare the therapeutic efficacy of cyproterone acetate (CPA) and a depot preparation of the LHRH superagonist (DTrp6-LHRH) in 10 patients with polycystic ovarian disease (PCO). All patients were treated with both agents (50 mg/day CPA, orally and (3 mg DTrp6-LHRH, im, approximately once a month) for 3 months, the 2 treatment periods being separated by 6 months. Both treatments resulted in marked clinical improvement, with diminished acne and seborrhoea and normalization of ovarian size by ultrasonographic criteria. In response to CPA treatment, basal plasma gonadotropin levels decreased, but the response to a LHRH test was not completely suppressed. Plasma estradiol, estrone, testosterone, and androstenedione levels significantly decreased, but urinary 3 alpha-androstanediol and plasma dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate levels did not change significantly. In contrast to CPA treatment, both basal and stimulated gonadotropin levels were completely suppressed after 3 weeks of treatment with DTrp6-LHRH. After a slight initial evaluation on day 2, plasma estrogen and androgen levels, with the exception of dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate fell into the castrate range urinary 3 alpha-androstanediol excretion decreased significantly. Thus, in patients with PCO, LHRH-A induced more complete gonadotropin inhibition than did CPA. After cessation of either therapy, the disease rapidly recurred.<doc-sep>",

After a 30-minute application Emla cream significantly reduced the pain of debridement compared with the placebo.<doc-sep>Pain control in the surgical debridement of leg ulcers by the use of a topical lidocaine--prilocaine cream, EMLA.<doc-sep>The analgesic effect of EMLA 5% cream for surgical cleansing of leg ulcers was investigated in an open study and in a double-blind comparison with placebo. Eighty patients with ulcers of venous or arterial origin participated. The cream was applied under occlusion and removed before cleansing. Plasma concentrations of lidocaine and prilocaine were assessed. The maximum individual concentrations were 0.8 microgram/ml for lidocaine and 0.08 microgram/ml for prilocaine. Pain was assessed according to a verbal rating scale and on a 100 mm visual analogue scale. The median VAS pain scores for EMLA and placebo were 18.5 and 84 mm (p less than 0.01). There were no severe adverse reactions. The results show that there is a need for pain control in surgical debridement of leg ulcers and that EMLA cream gives satisfactory analgesia for this procedure.<doc-sep>Analgesic efficacy of an ibuprofen-releasing foam dressing compared with local best practice for painful exuding wounds.<doc-sep>To examine if wound aetiology has an effect on the pain-relieving properties of an ibuprofen-releasing foam dressing, which was previously shown to reduce pain in wounds of various aetiologies, compared with local best practice (LBP).\n                This was a secondary analysis of data from a multicentre, randomised, parallel group trial of patients with painful exuding wounds of various aetiologies. Wound aetiology was determined at enrolment. Of 853 patients enrolled into the trial, 688 belonged to a wound aetiology subgroup that included >25 patients and were included in the analysis reported here. Patients were randomised to a dressing containing 112.5mg of ibuprofen (ibuprofen foam) or to LBP for 5 days. Patients recorded pain relief and pain intensity daily. The main endpoint was the proportion of patients who, from day 1 to day 5, reported a summed pain relief score >50% of the total maximum pain relief score (TOTPARD5>50%) and the corresponding number needed to treat (NNT) for each wound aetiology subgroup. Further analyses included the proportion of patients who, on a daily basis, reported pain relief >50% of the maximum daily pain relief, the proportion of patients who, on day 5, experienced a reduction in pain intensity of >50% of the maximum score (PIDD5>50%), and if PIDD5>50% was related to baseline pain intensity.\n                Patients were categorised by the following five wound types: arterial, venous, and mixed arterial-venous leg ulcers, vasculitis and traumatic ulcers. The ibuprofen foam dressing was associated with significantly greater pain relief than LBP in all different wound aetiology subgroups, whether chronic or traumatic (acute). Overall, TOTPARD5>50% was 55% in the ibuprofen foam group and 24% in the LBP group (p<0.0001; NNT, 3.2). The pain intensity evaluations revealed similar results in favour of ibuprofen foam compared with LBP. No correlation was observed between PIDD5>50 and initial pain intensity.\n                In this study, the ibuprofen foam dressing was shown to consistently relieve wound pain in exuding wounds of various aetiologies, irrespective of basal pain intensity. The data suggest that local pain relief by an ibuprofen foam dressing is possible in the most common, painful, exuding, chronic and acute/traumatic wounds and so is a safer alternative to systemic pain treatment.<doc-sep>Repeated treatment with lidocaine/prilocaine cream (EMLA) as a topical anaesthetic for the cleansing of venous leg ulcers. A controlled study.<doc-sep>Repeated topical analgesia with EMLA 5% cream prior to the cleansing of venous leg ulcers was studied. Patients were randomly allocated to a series of 8 treatments with EMLA (n = 22) or to a control group (n = 21). A thick layer of the cream was applied to the ulcers for 30 min. At each of the 8 treatments, local reactions were assessed on a 4-point scale and pain from ulcer cleansing on a visual analogue scale. At the first and the last treatment the area of the ulcer was determined by mapping, a sample for a bacterial culture was taken and the amount of dead tissue, slough and granulation tissue present was assessed. Treatment with EMLA for 30 min significantly decreased the pain from cleansing of the leg ulcers and the frequency of post-cleansing pain. The analgesic effect remained unchanged with successive treatments. Repeated treatment with EMLA in leg ulcers would appear to be safe, as indicated by the absence of any serious untoward events. No statistically significant differences in local reactions or adverse effects on granulation tissue, ulcer area or bacterial flora were observed in the EMLA-treated patients compared with the control patients.<doc-sep>",
         "There is some evidence to suggest that ibuprofen dressings may offer pain relief to people with painful venous leg ulcers. EMLA (5%) appears to provide effective pain relief during the debridement of venous leg ulcers. Further research should consider standardised pain assessment methods and assess both the effect on ulcer healing and the impact of long term use of these treatments.",

After more than 20 days postoperatively 3 late infections were observed which had a mild course (2 cases in the one-shot group, 1 case in the short-time prophylaxis group). All infections were localized in the sacral wound region in patients with abdominoperineal resection. The abdominal wounds healed per primam in each case. Besides those, 26 infections of the urinary tract were observed, which occurred significantly more often after the one-shot dose (40.9%) than with the short-time prophylaxis (18.6%). Intraoperative smears of the lumen of the bowels showed a remaining bacterial settlement. Besides Bacteroides species, especially Escherichia coli were found among the isolates. Moreover in some cases Clostridium, Klebsiella, Proteus and Pseudomonas could be identified. Smears of the site of operation (sacral/peritoneal cavity) were contaminated in over 50%, above all by Bacteroides species; besides those, E. coli were found most often. The subcutaneous smears showed a growth of the germs only in a few cases. Aerobic bacteria in 93.8%, anaerobic bacteria except for thetaiotaomicron and B. asaccharolyticus in 85.1%.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)<doc-sep>Comparison of metronidazole with doxycycline prophylaxis in elective colorectal surgery. A prospective, randomized multicentre study.<doc-sep>In a series of 157 patients undergoing elective colorectal surgery, metronidazole or doxycycline was given to prevent infectious complications. The prophylaxis was started just before the operation and was administered for a total of three days. Excluding mild, negligible infections, 39 (25%) of the 157 patients had infectious complications, 23 from the metronidazole group (28%) and 16 from the doxycycline group (21%). The type of infection varied according to the medication. In four cases of the metronidazole group and 16 of the doxycycline group, anaerobic bacteria were found. The corresponding figures for aerobes were 36 and 20. Doxycycline thus was significantly more effective in preventing complications in general, but metronidazole gave superior protection against anaerobes.<doc-sep>Prophylactic use of cefotaxime in colonic and rectal surgery.<doc-sep>Two hundred and seventeen patients, undergoing abdominal colonic and rectal surgery, received after randomization, the following regimen: group A (74 patients): cefotaxime 1 g intravenous at the induction of anaesthesia, the beginning of the resection, 4 and 8 h later; group B (72 patients): cefotaxime in the same regimen associated with ornidazole or metronidazole 0.5 g intravenous at the induction of anaesthesia and 0.5 g intravenous with the last injection of cefotaxime; group C (71 patients):cefotaxime following the same regimen as groups A and B and metronidazole orally 0.5 tds 3 days before surgery. All wounds were assessed daily, until discharge from hospital. Severe sepsis included: septicaemia, peritonitis, intra-abdominal abscess and extra-abdominal infections with death. Non-severe sepsis included all others. All the patients having a history of allergy to beta-lactam antibiotics and those with pre-operative infection were excluded. Mean age of the population was: 64.5 years. Seventy-seven patients had rectal cancer and 82 patients cancer of the colon; Twenty-five patients had inflammatory bowel disease, and in 33 others disease such as polyposis was present. Risk factors of post-operative infection were present in 115 cases (A, 36 patients; B, 37 patients; C, 42 patients). All three groups were very well matched for age, sex, type of intervention and diagnosis. Non-infectious complications appeared in 56 patients. Sepsis developed in 76 patients (A, 27 patients; B, 27 patients; C, 22 patients, no significant difference). Severe sepsis occurred in 14 patients (A, 6 patients; B, 4 patients; C, 4 patients, no significant difference) and in 62 patients non severe sepsis (A, 21 patients; B, 23 patients; C, 18 patients, no significant difference). Post-operative peritonitis was not seen. This study suggests that cefotaxime alone 4 g peri-operatively is useful in prophylaxis during rectal and colonic surgery.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)<doc-sep>A multicentre study to compare piperacillin with the combination of netilmicin and metronidazole for prophylaxis in elective colorectal surgery undertaken in district general hospitals.<doc-sep>We have conducted a multicentre randomized study to compare piperacillin with the combination of netilmicin and metronidazole in patients undergoing elective colorectal surgery. There was no significant difference in the incidence of operation-related infection, chest or urinary tract infection. Major life-threatening sepsis occurred in 6% and the overall incidence of operation-related infection was 24%. Organisms which normally inhabit the bowel lumen were cultured from most of the postoperative infections; however, Staphylococcus aureus was isolated as a causative organism in nine patients in the piperacillin group compared with none in the netilmicin and metronidazole group. We are concerned at the high incidence of infection in both groups, and we believe that other factors in addition to prophylactic antibiotics need to be evaluated if the incidence of infection is to be reduced further.<doc-sep>Parenteral single dose ceftriaxone with tinidatsole versus aminoglycoside with tinidatsole in colorectal surgery: a prospective single-blind randomized multicentre study.<doc-sep>A single dose preoperative antibiotic prophylaxis of ceftriaxone 2 g and tinidatsole 500 mg was compared with netilmycin (150 mg) or tobramycin (80 mg) in patients undergoing colorectal surgery by a prospective randomised single-blind trial. There were 628 patients from seven Finnish hospitals. The wound infection rate of 3% in the ceftriaxone group was significantly lower than 12% of the aminoglycoside group. Wound infection was related to the amount of perioperative blood loss, duration of the operation, type of operation and drainage in the aminoglycoside group. In the ceftriaxone group, wound infection was related to the patient's weight only.<doc-sep>Is neomycin necessary for bowel preparation in surgery of the colon? Oral neomycin plus erythromycin versus erythromycin-metronidazole.<doc-sep>In 132 patients who underwent elective surgery of the colon, the value of bowel preparation with a conventional oral antibiotic preparation of neomycin-erythromycin (N-E) was compared with erythromycin-metronidazole (E-M). Of 125 patients who were available for assessment, 61 received N-E and 64 E-M. The two groups were evenly matched. Two wound infections occurred in patients receiving E-M, neither due to anaerobic bacteria, but seven wound infections developed in patients given N-E (p = 0.057), five of them caused by anaerobic bacteria. Anaerobic bacteria of the colon are the dominant cause of postoperative wound infection in elective surgery of the colon. Adequate antibiotic preparation directed against these bacteria makes the use of neomycin unnecessary.<doc-sep>Timing of prophylactic antibiotics in abdominal surgery: trial of a pre-operative versus an intra-operative first dose.<doc-sep>When prophylactic antibiotics are used in abdominal surgery it is customary to give the first dose before the operation. Whilst intra-operative antibiotics may be effective in elective surgery, there may be an advantage to starting pre-operatively when there is already an infective focus such as appendicitis. Antibiotics started pre-operatively (group P) have been compared with antibiotics started after initial abdominal exploration (group T). Three intravenous doses of 500 mg metronidazole plus 1 g cephazolin were given in a randomized, double-blind study of 700 emergency and elective high-risk abdominal operations. Antibiotic plasma concentrations at the end of the operation were significantly lower in group P but lay well within the therapeutic range. Wound infection rates, which included minor and delayed infections, were similar in both groups (group P, 57 of 342, 16.7 per cent; group T, 55 of 358, 15.4 per cent; 95 per cent confidence intervals for the difference being -4.1 to +6.7 per cent. In appendicitis, wound infection rates were 12.1 and 13.9 per cent for groups P and T respectively. However, non-fatal deep sepsis was more common in group P (nine cases) than in group T (two cases) (chi 2 = 4.9, P less than 0.05). Postoperative infection was twice as common in obese patients whose body mass index (BMI) was greater than or equal to 26 (39 of 132, 30 per cent) than in thin patients whose BMI was less than 24 (41 of 288, 14 per cent; chi 2 = 13.8, P less than 0.001). This study failed to show any advantage to starting antibiotics pre-operatively, even in appendicitis.<doc-sep>Comparison of two systemic antibiotics for the prevention of complications in elective colorectal surgery.<doc-sep>In a prospective randomized trial on 77 patients undergoing elective colorectal surgery, cefoxitin and cephalothin were given as systemic antibiotic prophylaxis. Postoperative sepsis occurred in 2/40 (5%) of those given cefoxitin compared to 9/37 (24.3%) of those given cephalothin. The reduction in the infection rate in the group treated by cefoxitin was statistically significant (p less than 0.02). Specific drug toxicity was not evidenced except for transient skin rashes in two patients of both groups.<doc-sep>Single dose mezlocillin versus three dose cefuroxime plus metronidazole for the prophylaxis of wound infection after large bowel surgery.<doc-sep>A prospective, randomized, controlled trial was conducted in 116 consecutive patients undergoing colorectal surgery to compare single dose prophylaxis with mezlocillin to cefuroxime plus metronidazole in three doses. Patients were randomized to receive either a single dose of iv mezlocillin (5.0 g) or three doses of iv cefuroxime plus metronidazole at 8-hourly intervals. The first dose was given on the operating table. The overall wound infection rate in the mezlocillin treated patients (n = 54) was 30% and in the patients treated with cefuroxime plus metronidazole (n = 56) 25%. This difference is not statistically significant. When trivial wound infections were disregarded the wound infection rates were 11% and 16% respectively, which again was not statistically significant.<doc-sep>Comparison of cefotaxime plus metronidazole versus cefoxitin for prevention of wound infection after abdominal surgery.<doc-sep>In a randomized prospective stratified trial consisting of 1010 patients undergoing abdominal surgery involving the viscera, the efficacy of cefotaxime plus metronidazole was compared to cefoxitin for preventing wound infection. The efficacy of a single dose of antibiotics versus three doses over 24 hours was also evaluated. This study demonstrated that a single-dose antibiotic regimen was as effective as a multiple-dose regimen in the prophylaxis of wound infections following abdominal surgery. In addition it demonstrated that the cefotaxime plus metronidazole regimen is comparable to that of cefoxitin and is more cost-effective. It is concluded that a single dose of cefotaxime plus metronidazole provides effective prophylaxis against postoperative wound infections following abdominal surgery.<doc-sep>Prophylaxis of infection following colorectal surgery.<doc-sep>Due to the high incidence of infective complications following colorectal surgery, prophylactic application of systemic antibiotics is required. In a prospective, randomised study of 34 patients who underwent elective colorectal surgery, it was found that a single 1 g dose of cefotaxime was as effective as three doses in controlling post-operative infections. Both groups received 500 mg metronidazole i.v. every 12 h for 72 h, with the first dose administered immediately prior to surgery. The results indicate that prophylactic cefotaxime and metronidazole are effective in reducing the incidence of septic complications following colorectal surgery; nevertheless, a study with a larger number of patients is needed to reach a definitive conclusion.<doc-sep>Preincisional intraparietal Augmentin in abdominal operations.<doc-sep>A total of 624 consecutive eligible patients undergoing abdominal operations received a single preoperative dose of amoxycillin/clavulanic acid (1.2 g Augmentin) for the prophylaxis of surgical wound infection. They were randomised to have the antibiotic injected intravenously at induction of anaesthesia (n = 328) or infiltrated subcutaneously along the line of the proposed incision (n = 296). The incidence of wound infections was considerably lower in the group given the antibiotic into the abdominal wall (8.4% compared with 15.9%--chi 2 = 7.90, P = 0.005). No significant differences were found in the incidence of other major or minor infective or non-infective postoperative complications between the groups. It is concluded that preincisional intraparietal injection is more effective than intravenous injection of Augmentin for the prophylaxis of surgical wound infection.<doc-sep>Antibiotics in elective colon surgery. A randomized trial of oral, systemic, and oral/systemic antibiotics for prophylaxis.<doc-sep>A prospective, randomized double-blind study was undertaken to compare the efficacy of three prophylactic regimens (oral neomycin and erythromycin, intravenous cefoxitin, and a combination of both oral and intravenous antibiotics) in patients undergoing elective colorectal surgery. One hundred sixty-nine patients were randomized and 146 patients were evaluable. Septic complications occurred in 11.4 per cent of patients receiving oral antibiotics only, in 11.7 per cent of patients receiving intravenous cefoxitin alone, and in 7.8 per cent of patients receiving both oral and intravenous antibiotics. These differences were not statistically different. The greatest number of septic complications occurred in those patients with anastomotic disruptions. Two patients died (1.3%), both of whom had major anastomotic failures. There was no advantage between any of the groups in the incidence of wound infection (3.9-6.8%). Thus, no advantage could be identified in this study in the combination of oral and intravenous antibiotics in elective colorectal surgery.<doc-sep>Failure of single-dose metronidazole prophylaxis in colorectal surgery. No benefit from high dosage or combination with nalidixic acid.<doc-sep>In an open prospective study of postoperative infectious complications, patients undergoing elective colorectal surgery were randomly allocated to one of three groups receiving parenteral single-dose antimicrobial prophylaxis (1 g or 3 g metronidazole or 1 g metronidazole + 3 g nalidixic acid). Because of an unacceptably high rate of surgical infection in all three groups (36%, 29% and 39%, p greater than 0.1) among the first 103 evaluable patients, the study was discontinued. Nalidixic acid--though effective in in vitro tests of bacterial susceptibility--thus was found to be of little or no value as prophylaxis against Gram-negative infection. As the observed infection rate when metronidazole was given at the start of operation was seven-fold that previously found in the same department when 1 g metronidazole was administered 3-4 hours preoperatively (28/103 vs. 2/50, p less than 0.01), the timing of metronidazole prophylaxis was assumed to be potentially important for its ability to protect also against aerobic postoperative infection.<doc-sep>[Antibiotic prophylaxis in colon surgery with Cefazolin].<doc-sep>In a prospective randomized and controlled double-blind trial the effect of prophylactic systemic administration of Cefazolin in elective colorectal surgery on postoperative wound infection was investigated. The incidence of wound infection was significantly reduced (P less than 0.01) from 32% in the control group to 10% in the treated group. Furthermore there was a significant reduction (P less than 0.05) in hospital stay of about 3 days.<doc-sep>Tinidazole and doxycycline as antimicrobials in elective colorectal surgery. A randomized multicentre trial.<doc-sep>A prospective randomized study on the effect of doxycycline alone, tinidazole alone and the two antimicrobials in two different combinations as prophylactic antimicrobials on elective colorectal surgery is presented (Table II). The number of patients included in the study was 265. Of the four different treatment groups, the one which consisted of a single preoperative dose of tinidazole 2 g and doxycycline 200 mg, seemed to give the most favourable result. In this treatment group (n = 70), wound sepsis was recorded in 7.2% and perineal sepsis in 34.8% of the cases. Only one serious, but non-fatal intra-abdominal complication (1.4%) was observed in this group. The trial did not include a placebo group.<doc-sep>[Antibiotic prophylaxis in colorectal surgery: results of a randomized clinical study].<doc-sep><doc-sep>Systemic versus systemic plus oral chemoprophylaxis in elective colorectal surgery.<doc-sep><doc-sep>Single-dose surgical prophylaxis using ticarcillin/clavulanic acid (Timentin): a prospective, randomized comparison with cefotaxime.<doc-sep>Single 3.1-g dose surgical prophylaxis with ticarcillin/clavulanic acid (Timentin) was compared to single-dose cefotaxime. Among 224 evaluable cases, the Timentin associated wound infection rate (0.7%), nonwound infectious morbidity (8.8%), adverse reactions (1.9%), and total costs ($14.15) were not statistically different than that of the control drug. The beta-lactamase [corrected] inhibitor combination reported herein should be considered along with other beta-lactams [corrected] for use as a cost-effective, single-dose surgical prophylaxic agent on a wide variety of operative procedures.<doc-sep>Single-dose cephalosporin prophylaxis of 929 surgical procedures in a prepaid group practice: a prospective, randomized comparison of cefoperazone and cefotaxime.<doc-sep>In this report, we summarize 929 surgical cases (812 evaluable) receiving preoperatively prophylaxis with either cefoperazone (1 g), or cefotaxime (1 g). The patients were randomized to one of the two single-dose cephalosporin regimens and by operative procedure groups that included hysterectomies, genitourinary procedures, gastrointestinal operations, and the \"other procedures\" category that was dominated by orthopedic cases, such as total joint replacements and open fracture reductions. The postoperative wound infectious morbidity rates were: cefoperazone 2.2% and cefotaxime 3.0% (overall rate, 2.6%). Most wound infections were superficial, with more than half discovered after patient discharge and unrelated to the surgical prophylaxis. The wound infections associated with colorectal surgery cases given a single-dose of cefoperazone were twofold higher than the control regimen. Non-wound infectious morbidity was 5.8% (p greater than 0.05) for cefoperazone, mostly urinary tract infections causes by Escherichia coli, Streptococcus faecalis, and Staphylococcus spp. Side effects were not considered severe and occurred at a very low rate. Abnormally elevated prothrombin times of patients receiving cefoperazone were not any more frequent than the control regimens. The two prophylaxis regimens were not different statistically (p greater than 0.05) as to the infectious morbidity or adverse reactions. By using either studied single-dose schedule in our prepaid group practice setting, compared with the previously used multi-dose schedules, we could predict an annualized cost savings of $50,000 (cefazolin) and greater than $200,000 (cefoxitin). We propose a single 1-g dose of cefoperazone or cefotaxime (FDA approved) as a cost-effective prophylaxis alternative.<doc-sep>Postoperative infections in colonic surgery after enteral bacitracin-neomycin-clindamycin or parenteral mezlocillin-oxacillin prophylaxis.<doc-sep>In a prospective randomized, blind trial, three groups of patients undergoing elective colonic surgery were compared for frequency of surgical wound infection, intra-operative wound contamination and other postoperative infections. All patients allotted to the three groups received whole gut irrigation (101 balanced salt solution) by gastric tube on the evening before surgery and were treated as follows. Group A: no antibiotics; Group B: neomycin (1 g/l) + bacitracin (50,000 IU/l) + clindamycin (900 mg/l), contained in the last 31 of irrigation fluid; Group C: mezlocillin (4 g) + oxacillin (2 g) intravenously (iv) at induction of anaesthesia, followed by two identical doses at 8 and 16 h. The rate of postoperative wound infection was highest in A (38 per cent) and much lower in B (3.3 per cent, P less than 0.002) and C (6.9 per cent, P less than 0.004). The difference between B and C was statistically not significant. In A a correlation was established between the degree of wound contamination and the occurrence of wound infection. Intra-operative wound contamination was lowest in B (30 per cent), equal in A (58.1 per cent) and B (55.2 per cent). Other infections were least frequent in group C (four of 29 patients), but were not significantly different to groups B (six of 30) and A (nine of 31). It is concluded that antibiotics together with an effective mechanical preparation considerably reduce the rate of wound infection in colonic surgery.<doc-sep>Ceftriaxone vs. ampicillin + metronidazole as prophylaxis against infections after clean-contaminated abdominal surgery.<doc-sep>In a prospective, controlled, double-blind study, 496 patients undergoing abdominal surgery were given antibiotic prophylaxis with a single dose of either ceftriaxone or ampicillin + metronidazole. No significant intergroup difference was found between the respective overall rates of infectious complications (3.2% and 4.9%). Analysis of the microbiologic findings showed incisional wound infections, mainly caused by gram-negative rods, to be more common in the ampicillin-metronidazole group, whereas deep wound infections were more frequent in the ceftriaxone group. It is concluded that ceftriaxone seems to be more efficient than ampicillin-metronidazole as prophylaxis against incisional wound infection, but should preferably be supplemented with an antianaerobic agent to prevent deep wound infections.<doc-sep>Single-dose cefotetan vs. multiple-dose cefoxitin--antimicrobial prophylaxis in colorectal surgery. Results of a prospective, multicenter, randomized study.<doc-sep>This multicenter, prospective, randomized trial of short-term antimicrobial prophylaxis in colorectal surgery was designed to compare the efficacy of a single dose of cefotetan vs. multiple doses of cefoxitin. Of the 403 evaluable patients, 206 received cefoxitin (1 gm intravenously at the beginning of surgery and after 3, 6, and 12 hours, group A) and 197 cefotetan (2 gm intravenously at the beginning of surgery, group B). The two groups of patients were similar in respect to age, sex, obesity, preoperative weight loss, diabetes, type of disease, type, and mean duration of surgery. The abdominal wound infection rate was 11.2 percent in group A and 9.1 percent in group B (difference not significant). The number of patients with infections at nonsurgical sites (respiratory and urinary tract, phlebitis, and septicemia) was significantly greater in group A than in group B (17 vs. 9.1 percent, P less than .05). The mean postoperative hospital stay was similar in both the cefoxitin and cefotetan groups (15.1 vs. 15.9 days). Both regimens were inadequate in preventing infections in the presence of severe contamination of the operative field.<doc-sep>Antibiotic prophylaxis in elective gastro-intestinal tract surgery: a comparison of single-dose pre-operative cefotaxime and multiple-dose cefoxitin.<doc-sep>In a prospective trial conducted at five medical centres, 136 patients aged 18 to 75, undergoing elective gastro-intestinal surgery were randomized to receive a single dose of cefotaxime, 1 g preoperatively, or cefoxitin, 2 g preoperatively followed by 2 g every 6 h for no more than 24 h. Overall infection rates with both regimens were approximately 10%. There were no significant differences in the infection rates between subgroups. Thus, a single preoperative 1 g dose of cefotaxime is as efficacious as, but considerably more cost-effective than, multiple 2 g doses of perioperative cefoxitin in the prevention of infection following elective gastrointestinal tract surgery.<doc-sep>Short-term antibiotic prophylaxis in elective colorectal surgery.<doc-sep>In the last 2 years, 50 patients who underwent elective colorectal surgery were prospectively studied about antibiotic prophylaxis. Two groups of 25 patients each were randomly selected. Both received: (a) a colic preparation: hypactic drugs and two enemas during the day before surgery and (b) metronidazole 0.5 g plus neomycin 1 g per 8 h orally for 1 day before surgery. Every group also received: group A, metronidazole 0.5 g plus amikacin 500 mg i.v. 2 h before surgery and the same doses per 8 or 12 h, respectively, for 2 days postoperatively; group B, ornidazole 1 g by intravenous infusion plus ceftriaxone 2 g i.v. 2 h before surgery and the same doses of the drugs per 24 h for 2 days postoperatively. Wound infection occurred in 1 case of group A versus 2 cases of group B (p greater than 0.25). Ornidazole plus ceftriaxone prophylactic antibiotic therapy is therefore as effective as a classic therapy (metronidazole plus amikacin) and constitutes an alternative choice for patients undergoing elective colorectal surgery, because the simple manner of its administration (once per 24 h) is resulting in cost saving due to gained nursing time.<doc-sep>Wound sepsis after colorectal surgery: the effect of cefotetan lavage.<doc-sep><doc-sep>Cefoxitin for one day vs. ampicillin and metronidazole for three days in elective colorectal surgery. A prospective, randomized, multicenter study.<doc-sep>In a multicenter study the prophylactic efficacy of two antibiotic regimens was tested against postoperative septic complications following elective colorectal surgery. The study was conducted in a prospective block-randomized design. Patients were preoperatively allocated to either ampicillin, 1 gm, four times daily, and metronidazole, 0.5 gm, three times daily, for 72 hours, or to cefoxitin, 2 gm, given three times in a period of 10 hours. Both regimens were initiated immediately before surgery. Forty-five patients were withdrawn from the study after randomization. Three hundred fifty two patients (175 receiving ampicillin and metronidazole and 177 receiving cefoxitin) completed the study and were followed for one month postoperatively. The frequency of septic and nonseptic complications was not statistically significant different between the two regimens. About one third of all septic complications appeared more than two weeks after surgery. It is concluded that short-term treatment with cefoxitin is at least as efficient as a three-day treatment with ampicillin and metronidazole.<doc-sep>Sulbactam/ampicillin compared with cefoxitin for chemoprophylaxis in elective colorectal surgery.<doc-sep>In a prospective, randomized, comparative study, patients undergoing elective major colorectal surgery received four six-hour doses of either sulbactam (a beta-lactamase inhibitor) with ampicillin (1 gm with 1 gm), or cefoxitin (2 gm) commencing at induction of anesthesia. The groups were well matched for age, sex, diagnosis, and surgical procedures. Three patients in the sulbactam group (N = 44), and four in the cefoxitin group (N = 48) developed significant wound sepsis. Minor wound sepsis occurred in an additional four sulbactam patients, and in five cefoxitin patients. There was no difference between the groups in deep sepsis or anastomotic leak rates (sulbactam, four patients; cefoxitin, seven patients). No serious side effects were recorded in either group. These results suggest that sulbactam combined with ampicillin provides a safe, effective alternative to cefoxitin for prophylaxis in colorectal surgery.<doc-sep>A prospective randomized trial to compare triple dose mezlocillin with triple dose cefuroxime plus metronidazole as prophylaxis in colorectal surgery.<doc-sep>The results of a prospective randomized clinical trial to compare three dose regimens of mezlocillin with cefuroxime plus metronidazole for prophylaxis in emergency and elective colorectal surgery are reported. Severe wound infection occurred in five patients (10%) receiving mezlocillin and in four patients (7%) receiving cefuroxime and metronidazole. There were two episodes of septicaemia, each in the mezlocillin group. The total number of surgically related infections was less with cefuroxime plus metronidazole (n = 10) compared with mezlocillin (n = 17), but this was not statistically significant (P greater than 0.1).<doc-sep>An observer blind trial of co-amoxiclav versus cefuroxime plus metronidazole in the prevention of postoperative wound infection after general surgery.<doc-sep>A consecutive series of 509 patients undergoing abdominal surgery were entered into a randomized, observer and patient blind, controlled, prospective, study to evaluate the efficiency of co-amoxiclav ('Augmentin', SmithKline Beecham, UK) compared with cefuroxime ('Zinacef', Glaxo, UK) plus metronidazole (Flagyl, M&B, UK) for the prevention of postoperative wound infections. One or three doses of antibiotics were given depending on the type of surgery and operative factors. Co-amoxiclav was given to 230 patients with a total wound infection rate of 5.6% and cefuroxime plus metronidazole were given to 225 patients with a total wound infection rate of 3%. The difference between infection rates was not significant. Both groups were comparable in terms of demographic details, type and duration of surgery, risk factors associated with surgical procedures and postoperative management. Although not statistically significant, a difference in the wound infection rate for those patients undergoing colorectal surgery was seen: 8/69 for the co-amoxiclav group and 2/79 for the cefuroxime/metronidazole group. The estimated cost to our hospital (October, 1993) of one dose of co-amoxiclav was less that half the cost of cefuroxime and metronidazole. This study demonstrates that co-amoxiclav is an effective prophylactic antibiotic for abdominal surgery.<doc-sep>Should antimicrobial prophylaxis in colorectal surgery include agents effective against both anaerobic and aerobic microorganisms? A double-blind, multicenter study. The Norwegian Study Group for Colorectal Surgery.<doc-sep>It is now well demonstrated that a mixed flora of aerobic and anaerobic microorganisms will be found in wound abscesses and peritonitis after bowel surgery. An impressive reduction in infectious complications caused by anaerobic microorganisms can be achieved with nitroimidazole prophylaxis, but considerable uncertainty about the role of agents active against aerobic microorganisms in such prophylaxis still exists. We have earlier reported that a single dose of tinidazole and doxycycline significantly reduces postoperative infections and is superior to doxycycline alone. The effect of an agent active only against anaerobic microorganisms was tested in a double-blind study of 267 patients who underwent elective colorectal surgery. The patients received either tinidazole (1600 mg) and placebo or tinidazole (1600 mg) and doxycycline (400 mg) as a single preoperative infusion. Patients who received tinidazole and doxycycline had significantly fewer infectious complications, reoperations, additional use of antibiotics, and a shorter hospital stay. Microbiologic studies demonstrated that tinidazole alone gave effective protection against anaerobic organisms but did not protect the patients from aerobic gram-negative infectious complications. A single preoperative dose of antimicrobial agents effective against both anaerobic and aerobic bowel organisms seems to be the preferred prophylaxis for patients undergoing colorectal surgery.<doc-sep>Comparison of two prophylactic single-dose intravenous antibiotic regimes in the treatment of patients undergoing elective colorectal surgery in a district general hospital.<doc-sep>Two hundred and twenty-nine patients were entered into a study to compare the effectiveness and safety of two single-shot antibiotic regimes in patients undergoing elective colorectal surgery in two district general hospitals. A single shot of intravenous (IV) latamoxef disodium was as effective as an IV combination of cefuroxime and metronidazole in control of wound infection following elective large bowel surgery when given as a bolus at the time of anaesthetic induction. The incidence of major wound infection was 6% and was evenly distributed in the two treatment groups. Half the major wound infections were associated with faecal fistulae. A single shot of IV antibiotic at the time of anaesthetic induction was safe, simple and an effective prophylaxis against major wound infection. There was a low incidence (1.3%) of serious postoperative bleeding and no serious adverse reactions were noted. The overall mortality was 9%. Death was significantly related to elderly patients, a poor performance status, operative contamination and wound infections.<doc-sep>Tinidazole and doxycycline compared to doxycycline alone as prophylactic antimicrobial agents in elective colorectal surgery.<doc-sep>Forty-two patients admitted for elective colorectal surgery were given tinidazole and doxycycline or doxycycline alone as prophylactic antimicrobials in a double-blind study. There was altogether one abdominal wound infection (2.4%), and one patient developed a perineal fistula three months after the operation. No significant difference in postoperative infections between the two groups could be demonstrated. It is concluded that doxycycline seems effective in reducing wound sepsis after operations on the large intestine and that additional administration of tinidazole will yield little in prophylaxis.<doc-sep>Value of oral antibiotic prophylaxis in colorectal surgery.<doc-sep>A total of 169 patients undergoing colorectal surgery were randomly allocated to receive either gentamicin plus metronidazole or oral ciprofloxacin plus metronidazole as prophylaxis; they were also allocated to receive cover for 1 or 3 days. Twenty-eight patients (17 per cent) developed postoperative wound infections. The proportion of patients with wound infections and other infective complications was significantly less (P < 0.02) in those receiving oral ciprofloxacin. Cover for 3 days was no better than that for only 1 day. Oral ciprofloxacin for prophylaxis may offer advantages in efficacy and ease of administration compared with parenteral antibiotics.<doc-sep>Single-dose amoxycillin-clavulanic acid vs. cefotetan for prophylaxis in elective colorectal surgery: a multicentre, prospective, randomized study. The PRODIGE Group.<doc-sep>A prospective, multicentre, randomized trial was carried out in 19 hospitals in order to compare the efficacy of amoxycillin-clavulanic acid with cefotetan as antibiotic prophylaxis in patients undergoing elective colorectal surgery. Since the main purpose of the study was to demonstrate equivalence between the two regimens, the protocol planned the inclusion of 200 patients. Eligible patients were randomly assigned to receive either amoxycillin-clavulanic acid (2.2 g) or cefotetan (2 g) in a single infusion on the induction of anaesthesia. Failure of prophylaxis was defined as occurrence of infection of intestinal origin, either minor (wound cellulitis) or major (abscess, peritonitis, septicaemia) within the 30-day postoperative period. Among 221 randomized patients, 208 (105 amoxycillin-clavulanic acid, 103 cefotetan) aged 66 +/- 12 years (mean +/- SD) were evaluated while 13 were withdrawn. Colorectal cancer was the indication for surgery in 73% of cases. Eleven (10 +/- 6%, 95% confidence interval) and 13 (13 +/- 7%) failures were observed in the amoxycillin-clavulanic acid and cefotetan groups (P = 0.63 chi-square test) respectively. Most infections occurred before the 10th postoperative day (8% failures at this time, estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method). The results of the trial demonstrate that amoxycillin-clavulanic acid and cefotetan have similar efficacy when used for prophylaxis of infection after elective colorectal surgery.<doc-sep>A prospective, randomized, double-blind studyof single high dose versus multiple standard dose gentamicin both in combination withmetronidazole for colorectal surgicalprophylaxis.<doc-sep>Single, high dose regimens of gentamicin plus metronidazole for colorectal surgical prophylaxis have not been adequately studied. Patients received single high dose gentamicin (4.5 mg/kg) plus metroni-dazole (500 mg) preoperatively or multiple standard dose gentamicin (1.5 mg/kg) plus metronidazole (500 mg) preoperatively and every 8h for 24h postoperatively. The deep surgical site infection (SSI) rates were 8.1% (6/74) and 6.9% (5/72) in the single high dose and multiple standard dose groups, respectively (P= 0.94). There was a trend towards fewer superficial SSIs in the single high dose group with infection rates of 18.9% (14/74) vs. 30.6% (22/72) (P= 0.05). Diabetes mellitus (odds ratio = 7.04) and surgery duration of longer than 3h (odds ratio = 5.46) were independent risk factors for the development of SSIs. A subset analysis of prolonged operations found significantly fewer superficial SSIs in the single high dose group than in the multiple standard dose group with rates of 22.2% (6/27) vs. 55% (11/20), respectively (P= 0.021). Single high dose gentamicin plus metronidazole preoperatively was at least as effective as the multiple standard dose regimen and may be more effective for prolonged operations.\n                Copyright 2000 The Hospital Infection Society.<doc-sep>[Parenteral antibiotic prophylaxis or oral antimicrobial bowel preparation for colorectal surgery (author's transl)].<doc-sep>A prospective randomized trial was designed to establish whether parenteral antibiotic prophylaxis was as effective as oral antimicrobial bowel preparation in preventing sepsis after colorectal surgery. Patients scheduled for elective resection of colorectal cancer received metronidazole and kanamycin either orally in the preoperative phase or parenterally as a short-term perioperative prophylaxis. The former regimen resulted in reduction of the microbial concentrations in the bowel contents in the absence of therapeutic serum concentrations at the time of operation, whereas the latter achieved therapeutic intraoperative serum levels without altering the colonic microflora. 72 patients were studied. There was no significant difference in the occurrence of postoperative sepsis between the two groups (a total of 72 patients). These results differ from those obtained at the Birmingham General Hospital using the same protocol, in which postoperative sepsis was significantly more common in the group of patients having oral bowel preparation. This difference was most probably due to an overgrowth of kanamycin-resistant coliforms during the period of oral antibiotic preparation. The presence of resistant organisms did not, however, result in failure of systemic prophylaxis. The authors conclude that short-term parenteral application is the safer method of antibiotic prophylaxis in colorectal surgery and is to be preferred to oral antimicrobial bowel preparation.<doc-sep>[Preventive preoperative antibiotic therapy in elective colon surgery. A controlled prospective randomized study].<doc-sep>Antibiotic prophylaxis in elective colonic surgery is of established value and most authors have proposed an association of at least two drugs. We have compared the efficacy of classical prophylaxis (clindamycin and gentamicin, C + G) with that of the single drug cefoxitin (Ce). 101 consecutive patients were covered; 22 had to be excluded and 7 withdrawn after randomization; 72 cases were left for final analysis (C + G 35; Ce 37). Five C + G (14.2%) and 4 Ce cases (10.8%) developed septic complications, possibly caused by opening of the colon (wound infection, anastomotic failure, colocutaneous fistula): this difference is not statistically significant. Episodes of sepsis, urinary tract infection and pneumonia were similar in both groups. Although the number of patients included is relatively small, we conclude that prophylaxis with Ce alone appears to be as effective as double drug prophylaxis with C + G.<doc-sep>Comparison of short-term antibiotic cover with a third-generation cephalosporin against conventional five-day therapy using metronidazole with an aminoglycoside in emergency and complicated colorectal surgery.<doc-sep>In a prospective, randomized control trial, 152 consecutive patients requiring emergency or complicated colorectal surgery were allocated either to two doses of cefotetan or to five-day cover with gentamicin, and a single dose of metronidazole. Twenty-one patients received 6 gm of cefotetan before prolongation of prothrombin time dictated a change in the dose regimen such that all remaining patients (N = 55) received only 4 gm of cefotetan. The groups were well matched for diagnosis and surgical procedure. Rates of postoperative infection did not differ significantly between the groups, with wound infection rates occurring in 17 of 75 patients receiving gentamicin and metronidazole (22.7 percent) compared with ten of 75 receiving cefotetan (13 percent). Although wound infection rates were lower in the cefotetan group, the incidence of intra-abdominal abscess was similar in both groups. Eight patients receiving cefotetan developed intra-abdominal abscesses (11 percent), compared with seven receiving gentamicin and metronidazole (9 percent). Prolongation of prothrombin time in excess of 13 seconds occurred in six patients receiving cefotetan compared with no patients receiving gentamicin and metronidazole. None of these patients developed clinical bleeding, however.<doc-sep>[Pefloxacin + metronidazole versus netilmicin + metronidazole in the prevention of nosocomial infections in contaminated surgery. Pefloxacin Study Group].<doc-sep>Pefloxacin plus metronidazole versus netilmicin plus metronidazole in the prevention of nosocomial infections during contaminated surgery. Surgical prophylaxis is widely used in contaminated surgery, especially colorectal surgery. In this clinical trial the efficacy of pefloxacin 800 mg i.v. slow infusion associated to metronidazole 500 mg i.v. 1-2 hours before surgery and then metronidazole alone after 6 and 12 hours versus netilmicin 200 mg i.m. associated to metronidazole 500 mg i.v. 1-2 hours before surgery and then both after 6 and 12 hours were evaluated in 97 patients suffering by colorectal surgery. Efficacy of prophylaxis in patients was evaluated in terms of appearance of post-surgical infections (abdominal, urinary, respiratory and wound infections). In pefloxacin + metronidazole group (53 patients), two cases of wound infections (3.8%) and three cases of respiratory infections (5.8%) were observed. In netilmicin + metronidazole group (44 patients), two cases of wound infections (4.9%), three cases of urinary infections (7%), three cases of respiratory infections (7.5%) and one case of intra-abdominal infection were observed. Our data confirmed that in colorectal surgery, the association pefloxacin, drug with microbiological and pharmacokinetics characteristics suitable for prophylaxis + metronidazole, active against anaerobes pathogens, prevents post-surgical infections as well as a reference association (netilmicin + metronidazole), with the advantage of a single administration.<doc-sep>Antimicrobial chemoimmunoprophylaxis in colorectal surgery with cefotetan and thymostimulin: prospective, controlled multicenter study. Italian Study Group on Antimicrobial Prophylaxis in Abdominal Surgery.<doc-sep>Surgical antimicrobial prophylaxis was performed with a controlled study on 859 evaluable patients randomized into two groups treated with chemoprophylaxis only or chemo- and immunoprophylaxis in colorectal surgery. Immuno and chemoprophylactic treatment (425 patients) consisted of 70 mg i.m. thymostimulin per day for 7 days beginning 48 h before surgery plus 2 g cefotetan at the moment of induction of anesthesia; the other group (434 patients) received only the single dose of antibiotic. Results in the two different groups were significantly different regarding abdominal abscess and the total infectious episodes in the surgical site with lower frequency in patients receiving both thymostimulin and the antibiotic (cefotetan). Moreover the respiratory tract infections were more than double in those patients not treated with perioperative immunotherapy. Stratifying patients on the basis of grade of skin test reaction, we observed a significantly lower percentage of surgical site infection in hypoergic patients receiving chemo- and immunoprophylaxis.<doc-sep>Ertapenem versus cefotetan prophylaxis in elective colorectal surgery.<doc-sep>Ertapenem, a long-acting carbapenem, may be an alternative to the recommended prophylactic antibiotic cefotetan.\n                In this randomized, double-blind trial, we assessed the efficacy and safety of antibiotic prophylaxis with ertapenem, as compared with cefotetan, in patients undergoing elective colorectal surgery. A successful outcome was defined as the absence of surgical-site infection, anastomotic leakage, or antibiotic use 4 weeks postoperatively. All adverse events were collected until 14 days after the administration of antibiotic prophylaxis.\n                Of the 1002 patients randomly assigned to study groups, 901 (451 in the ertapenem group and 450 in the cefotetan group) qualified for the modified intention-to-treat analysis, and 672 (338 in the ertapenem group and 334 in the cefotetan group) were included in the per-protocol analysis. After adjustment for strata, in the modified intention-to-treat analysis, the rate of overall prophylactic failure was 40.2% in the ertapenem group and 50.9% in the cefotetan group (absolute difference, -10.7%; 95% confidence interval [CI], -17.1 to -4.2); in the per-protocol analysis, the failure rate was 28.0% in the ertapenem group and 42.8% in the cefotetan group (absolute difference, -14.8%; 95% CI, -21.9 to -7.5). Both analyses fulfilled statistical criteria for the superiority of ertapenem. In the modified intention-to-treat analysis, the most common reason for failure of prophylaxis in both groups was surgical-site infection: 17.1% in the ertapenem group and 26.2% in the cefotetan group (absolute difference, -9.1; 95% CI, -14.4 to -3.7). In the treated population, the overall incidence of Clostridium difficile infection was 1.7% in the ertapenem group and 0.6% in the cefotetan group (P=0.22).\n                Ertapenem is more effective than cefotetan in the prevention of surgical-site infection in patients undergoing elective colorectal surgery but may be associated with an increase in C. difficile infection.

Timentin, a combination of ticarcillin and clavulanic acid was administered intravenously (3.1 g) at the commencement of operation to all patients, and this was repeated after 2 hours in those patients randomized to receive a second dose. The wound infection rate was 11 percent in the 143 patients completing follow-up and receiving a single dose, and 13 percent in the 128 patients receiving two doses of Timentin (P greater than 0.05). The rates of postoperative septicemia 3 vs. 4 percent and intra-abdominal abscess 5 vs. 8 percent were similar. Multivariate analysis of the factors likely to affect postoperative would infection rate demonstrated an association with the type of hospital, public or private, wound infection rate 16 and 6 percent, respectively (P less than 0.01), and the surgeon group defined by the number of patients contributed greater than 25 or less than 25, wound infection rate 6 and 18 percent, respectively (P less than 0.05). We concluded that a single dose of intravenous Timentin was as effective as two doses for prophylaxis against surgical infection and that the surgeon group and the hospital in which the operation took place were statistically significant predictors of postoperative wound infection.<doc-sep>Selective cefuroxime prophylaxis following colorectal surgery based on intra-operative dipslide culture.<doc-sep>The concept of a very limited effective period for prophylactic antibiotic action was challenged in a prospective, controlled and randomized study featuring a simplified method for assessing the degree of contamination in the operative field during colorectal surgery. The 226 patients were given 1 g metronidazole IV on induction of anaesthesia and 12 h postoperatively. Following standardized saline irrigation of the abdominal cavity, a uriculture dipslide was dipped in the residual fluid just before abdominal closure. The dipslide was incubated for 18 h, and colony counts of coliforms and Staphylococcus aureus were made. The number of colony-forming units (CFU) was classified as 0, 1-4 or greater than or equal to 5 (n = 123, 33 and 70). The patients with CFU greater than or equal to 5 were randomized to receive cefuroxime (1.5 g IV/8 h for 2 days) or no more antibiotics. In the patients given only metronidazole, the incidence of postoperative infections rose with the colony counts (5.7, 9.1 and 41.2 per cent with CFU 0, 1-4 and greater than or equal to 5). Addition of cefuroxime reduced the 41.2 per cent infection rate to 8.3 per cent (P = 0.003). The method thus identified a high-risk group in which a short postoperative course of cefuroxime significantly lowered the rate of sepsis.<doc-sep>Antibiotic prophylaxis in colorectal surgery. Combined doxycycline-tinidazole vs. doxycycline alone.<doc-sep>Single-dose doxycycline was compared with single-dose doxycycline + tinidazole in regard to prevention of septic complications after colorectal surgery, taking into account the type and level of surgery--right or left hemicolectomy, rectal operations and others. The study was performed as a prospective double-blind trial, with randomization in blocks. In colorectal surgery as a whole the combination was found to be more effective than doxycycline alone. When the four surgical blocks were separately considered, however, the difference between the two regimens was found to be mainly due to rectal operations, following which the incidence of abdominal and of perineal wound infections was significantly lower with the combined regimen than with doxycycline alone. The subgroups composed of right-sided or left-sided hemicolectomy or other operations were too small to permit definite conclusions.<doc-sep>Impact of oral antimicrobial prophylaxis on surgical site infection and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infection after elective colorectal surgery. Results of a prospective randomized trial.<doc-sep>The impact of oral antimicrobial prophylaxis on the surgical site infection and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infection after elective colorectal surgery was evaluated by a prospective randomized single-blind study. The patients were randomly allocated to receive either mechanical bowel cleansing with polyethylene glycol alone (group 1) or mechanical cleansing plus oral antimicrobial prophylaxis with kanamycin and erythromycin for 2 days prior to surgery (group 2). In both groups, cefotiam was intravenously given twice a day for 3 days. A total of 143 patients (71 for group 1 and 72 for group 2) were eligible. The incidence of a surgical site infection was 23.9% in group 1 and 11.1% in group 2 (P = 0.04). The incidence of MRSA infection including at surgical and remote sites was 11.1% in group 1 and 5.6% in group 2 (P = 0.19). A multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that the risk of surgical site infection was influenced by the choice of the chemical bowel preparation (P = 0.03) and blood loss (P < 0.01), while an MRSA infection was predominantly influenced by blood loss (P < 0.01) followed by coexisting underlying diseases (P = 0.07). These results suggest that preoperative antimicrobial prophylaxis would be useful for reducing the incidence of a surgical site infection without increasing the risk of an MRSA infection following elective colorectal surgery.<doc-sep>Moxalactam as single-agent prophylaxis in the prevention of wound infection following colon surgery.<doc-sep>A single agent systemic antibiotic (moxalactam) when used prophylactically in patients undergoing colon surgery was associated with a wound infection rate comparable to that achieved by a combination of oral neomycin and intravenous metronidazole. The data obtained demonstrated that the reduced infection rate was not the result of a reduction in the bacterial content of the colon alone but due to the prophylactic agents used for elective colon surgery.<doc-sep>Single-dose antibiotic prophylaxis of abdominal surgical wound infection: a trial of preoperative latamoxef against peroperative tetracycline lavage.<doc-sep>A randomized controlled clinical trial was undertaken in 542 consecutive emergency and elective abdominal operations, with one group of patients receiving tetracycline peritoneal and wound lavage and the other a single intravenous injection of 1 g latamoxef at induction of anaesthesia. Seventy-five patients were withdrawn because no potentially contaminated hollow viscus was opened, and a further 36 because they could not be assessed for wound infection. Of the remaining 431 patients, 212 received latamoxef resulting in 5 major and 8 minor wound infections in hospital; another 4 minor infections occurred at home (total incidence 8.0%). In the tetracycline group (n = 219) there were 7 major and 19 minor wound infections in hospital and 10 minor infections later (total incidence 16.4%). This is significantly higher than the rate with latamoxef (P = 0.012). Monitoring of operative and postoperative bleeding revealed no evidence (except in one doubtful case) of excessive bleeding associated with the use of a single dose of latamoxef. It is concluded that single-dose preoperative latamoxef is more effective than peroperative tetracycline lavage for the prevention of wound infections after potentially contaminated abdominal operations.<doc-sep>Prophylactic antibiotics for elective colorectal surgery or operation for obstruction of the small bowel: a comparison of cefonicid and cefoxitin.<doc-sep>Elective colorectal surgery carries a rate of septic complications of up to 35% in patients not receiving prophylaxis. This can be reduced to 5% in patients receiving appropriate prophylactic agents. The safety and efficacy of cefonicid, a new cephalosporin with a half-life of 4-5 hr, were compared with those of cefoxitin for prophylaxis in patients undergoing elective colorectal procedures or surgery for obstruction of the small bowel. Fifty-seven assessable patients were randomly assigned in a double-blind fashion to therapy with 1 g of cefonicid intravenously (iv) or intramuscularly (im) 1 hr before surgery only or 2 g of cefoxitin iv or im 1 hr before surgery and 2 g every 6 hr for 24 hr. Groups were comparable in terms of underlying diseases. Samples for blood culture were obtained immediately before and after surgery and at 8:00 A.M. on the first and second postoperative days. No blood cultures were positive. Two of 30 patients receiving cefonicid developed wound infections (6%). Two of 27 patients receiving cefoxitin developed wound infections, and one developed an intraabdominal abscess (11%). No significant adverse effects were noted. The results suggest cefonicid may be an effective prophylactic antibiotic for bowel surgery. Most importantly, cefonicid offers the advantages associated with the administration of a single daily dosage, among which are reduction of pharmacy costs and the freeing of nursing hours for patient care.<doc-sep>[Antibiotic prophylaxis in elective colon surgery: comparison of the combination of metronidazole (Flagyl)/cefazolin (Kefzol) with cefazolin alone].<doc-sep>In this prospective trial prevention of infectious complications after elective colonic surgery was studied. 34 patients receiving i.v. cefazolin were compared to 32 patients receiving oral metronidazol and i.v. cefazolin. No significant difference was observed concerning local wound infection, septicemia, anastomotic dehiscence or death. The rate of postoperative infection was 53% in group I, 34% in group II. No side effects of this prophylaxis were observed.<doc-sep>Single-dose cefmetazole versus multiple dose cefoxitin for prophylaxis in abdominal surgery.<doc-sep>One hundred and ninety-five patients undergoing abdominal surgical procedures completed a multicentre, randomized, open-label study comparing the safety and efficacy of cefmetazole and cefoxitin for the prevention of postoperative wound infection. Cefmetazole was administered iv in a single 2 g dose given within 90 min of the operation. Cefoxitin was administered in a single 2 g, similarly timed, preoperative dose and two additional doses given at 6 h intervals after surgery. For operations that exceeded 2-4 h duration an additional dose of each agent was administered. Patients undergoing colorectal operations received oral neomycin and erythromycin as bowel preparation. Colorectal operations were performed most frequently (49% of patients) followed by cholecystectomies (26%) and gastroduodenal procedures (21%). The operative site infection rate was 6.5% for cefmetazole and 7.7% for cefoxitin (P greater than 0.05). Serious drug related adverse effects were not observed. This study demonstrates that administration of single-dose cefmetazole is as effective as a standard three dose regimen of cefoxitin for prophylaxis with abdominal operations.<doc-sep>Oral is superior to systemic antibiotic prophylaxis in operations upon the colon and rectum.<doc-sep>The prophylactic effect of a short preoperative loading dose of oral neomycin and erythromycin upon infectious complications following elective operations upon the colon and rectum was compared with the prophylactic effect of systemic administration of metronidazole and gentamicin preoperatively and postoperatively. In this randomized prospective clinical study, 45 patients received neomycin-erythromycin while 48 received metronidazole-gentamicin; all patients were prepared mechanically using whole gut irrigation with a mannitol solution. Both groups were comparable in sex, age, clinical diagnosis and type of operation performed. In the neomycin-erythromycin group, 41 of 45 patients had an uncomplicated postoperative course versus 35 of 48 patients in the other group (p less than 0.001) and fewer wound infections (p less than 0.05). We conclude that the better results observed with the neomycin-erythromycin combination is probably an addition of two effects--the decrease in colon flora and the adequate serum levels of antibiotics during the operation.<doc-sep>Oral prophylaxis with neomycin and erythromycin in colorectal surgery. More proof for efficacy than failure.<doc-sep>In an open, prospective, and randomized investigation on the prophylactic efficacy of peroral neomycin sulfate-erythromycin base vs intravenous ceftriaxone-metronidazole preparation in colorectal surgery, no significantly diverging results between regimens were recorded (1/27 [3.7%] and 2/27 [7.4%] wound infections, respectively). Commentary is made about the diverging results from earlier studies on antimicrobial prophylaxis and on the multifactorial causality of surgical infection. We believe that variables such as physical condition of the patients, virulence and local resistance patterns of bacteria, and technical skill of the surgeons are far more important in regard to the postoperative outcome concerning septic complications than is the choice of proper antibiotics. Thus, to determine the efficacy of antimicrobial prophylaxis, we call for larger investigations in the future, preferably double-blind, where it is possible to better control and diminish the influence of determinants other than the antibiotics being compared.<doc-sep>Single-dose intravenous metronidazole v. doxycycline prophylaxis in colorectal surgery. An open prospective, randomized trial.<doc-sep>In an open prospective, randomized study of antimicrobial prophylaxis in colorectal surgery, using a single intravenous dose, metronidazole (1 g) was more effective than doxycycline (0.2 g). The difference in infection rates (2/41 = 5% v. 7/33 = 21%) was statistically significant. Prolonged administration of either agent (2-7 days) yielded results comparable to those with single doses. Five emergency cases were admitted to the study. In two of them, a metronidazole-based therapeutic regimen prevented postoperative infection, whereas infection occurred in all 3 patients given doxycycline therapy. The total infection rate after elective surgery was 4% with metronidazole and 25% with doxycycline prophylaxis. The infections in the metronidazole group were superficial and caused by Escherichia coli, whereas half of the infections in the doxycycline group were intra-abdominal and due to intestinal aerobic and/or anaerobic bacteria. In contrast to doxycycline, therefore, metronidazole prevented postoperative anaerobic infection and was associated with low incidence of aerobic infection.<doc-sep>Single or multiple doses of metronidazole and ampicillin in elective colorectal surgery. A randomized trial.<doc-sep>A randomized trial including 294 patients was performed to evaluate the prophylactic effect of single vs. multiple doses of antibiotics in elective colorectal surgery. All patients received 1.5 g metronidazole and 3.0 g ampicillin peroperatively and were randomized to: no further prophylactic antibiotic treatment, or ampicillin 1 g X 3 and metronidazole 0.5 g X 3 given intravenously during the second and third postoperative days. Deep wound infection was seen in 9/149 (6 percent) receiving a single dose and in 8/145 (6 percent) receiving multiple doses. No differences were found in the two groups between frequencies of anastomotic dehiscences, intra-abdominal abscesses, sepsis, and pulmonary infections. The two groups were similar according to distribution of sex, age, diagnosis, and type of surgery. A single peroperative dose of metronidazole and ampicillin is a simple and satisfactory antibiotic prophylaxis in elective colorectal surgery.<doc-sep>Topical ampicillin in addition to a systemic antibiotic prophylaxis in elective colorectal surgery.

All received ampicillin, 1 g X 3, and metronidazole, 0.5 g X 3, intravenously for at least three days from induction of anesthesia, and 105 also received topical ampicillin, 1 g, in each of the surgical wounds. Deep wound infection or dehiscence was seen in 12 of 105 having both administrations of antibiotics, and in nine of 98 having only intravenous antibiotics. The two groups were similar according to distribution of sex, age, type of surgery, and efficiency of bowel preparation. Topical ampicillin should be omitted in elective colorectal surgery when systemic prophylaxis with ampicillin and metronidazole is used.<doc-sep>Prospective comparative study of cefotetan with piperacillin for prophylaxis against infection in elective colorectal surgery.<doc-sep>This study compared one dose of cefotetan with three doses of piperacillin as prophylaxis against wound infection in 153 patients undergoing elective colorectal surgery. The patients were randomized into two groups: the first received 2 g cefotetan intravenously with induction of anaesthesia (n = 75), and the second received three doses of 2 g piperacillin (n = 78). Wound infection was defined as the presence of an abscess or discharging pus from the wound. In the cefotetan group there were 14 (19%) wound infections and 13 (17%) in the piperacillin group. There were three septic deaths, one in the cefotetan group and two in the piperacillin group. Both groups were comparable with regard to age, sex, nature of pathology and pre- and perioperative risk factors. No significant haematological or biochemical abnormalities were detected. The only adverse reaction was one patient who had an allergic reaction (rash) to piperacillin. These data suggest that single-dose cefotetan is as effective as triple-dose piperacillin in prophylaxis against infection in elective colorectal surgery.<doc-sep>Short-term systemic prophylaxis with cefoxitin and doxycycline in colorectal surgery. A prospective, randomized study.<doc-sep>The efficacy of cefoxitin or doxycycline as antibiotic prophylaxis in colorectal surgery was compared in 102 elective operations. Both drugs were used perioperatively only. Cefoxitin was used in 55 cases and doxycycline in 47. Ten patients in the cefoxitin group and 4 in doxycycline group had wound infections. Three intraabdominal abscesses were seen, one after cefoxitin and two after doxycycline prophylaxis. All three were due to anastomotic leakage. Bacteriologic studies revealed no negative ecologic effects of prophylaxis. The short-term prophylaxis used did protect against serious infectious complications. The extended spectrum of cefoxitin provided no added benefit in prophylaxis. Patients with inflammatory bowel disease treated preoperatively with salicylazosulfapyridine run a greater risk of postoperative infection in spite of the prophylaxis.<doc-sep>Single versus multiple dose doxycycline prophylaxis in elective colorectal surgery.<doc-sep>One hundred and two patients undergoing elective colorectal surgery were randomized in a prospective but \"non-blind\" way into two groups. The first group received 0.4 g of doxycycline preoperatively and the second group 0.2 g of doxycycline preoperatively and 0.1 g of doxycycline on the first, second and third postoperative day. All doxycycline was administered by intravenous infusion. The infection rate was 10% in the \"one-dose\" treatment group and 10% in the \"four-dose\" treatment group. It is thus concluded that 0.4 g of doxycycline preoperatively results in an acceptable rate of postoperative infections, which may be explained by the satisfactory concentration of doxycycline up till three days after administration. The advantage of \"one-dose\" treatment compared to \"four-dose\" treatment from practical and economical standpoints are obvious.<doc-sep>Factors involved in antibiotic selection in elective colon and rectal surgery.<doc-sep>During a 24-month period, 350 patients were prospectively studied in an effort to determine the perioperative factors in the development of infections after colon and rectal resections. All patients received standard mechanical bowel preparation; perioperative parenteral cefoxitin (group A) or preoperative oral neomycin and erythromycin, in addition to perioperative cefoxitin (Group B), were also given. Both groups were comparable with respect to age, sex, associated diseases, and primary diagnosis. Wound infections developed in nine of 169 (5%) group B patients and in 15 of 141 (11%) group A patients. Stratification by type of operative procedure revealed that the rectal resections involved the highest rate of infection in group A (22%) and in group B (11%). In patients requiring intraperitoneal colon resection, the rates of wound sepsis were similar (3% in both groups). Analysis of length of operation revealed that in operations lasting 215 minutes or more the infection rate was 12%; in those lasting less than 215 minutes the rate was 4%. Patients with rectal resection and operative times of 215 minutes or more had a wound infection rate of 19% compared to 2% (p less than 0.05) in those with shorter nonrectal operations. Group B patients with the longer rectal operations had lower infection rates (11%) than group A patients (27%), while there was no difference among those who had shorter operations. Intra-abdominal abscesses (p less than 0.01) and anastomotic dehiscence (p less than 0.05) were also significantly reduced in group B patients. Postoperative wound infection is associated with length of operation and location of colon resection and can be significantly lowered by a combination of oral and parenteral antibiotics.<doc-sep>Fosfomycin/metronidazole compared with doxycycline/metronidazole for the prophylaxis of infection after elective colorectal surgery. A randomised double-blind multicentre trial in 517 patients.<doc-sep>To find out if fosfomycin together with metronidazole was any better than doxycycline with metronidazole for the prophylaxis of infection before elective colorectal operations.\n                Multicentre, double blind, random control trial.\n                Nine Swedish hospitals. SUBJECTS-559 patients admitted for elective colorectal operations.\n                Fosfomycin 8 g and metronidazole 1 g before operation and fosfomycin 8 g eight hours afterwards, or doxycycline 400 mg and metronidazole 1 g before operation, and placebo eight hours afterwards.\n                Incidence of all types of infection, mortality, and side effects.\n                There were no significant differences between the groups for any of the outcome measures studied, the overall abdominal infection rates (wound, deep, and septicaemia) being 4.6% and 7.4%, and the remote infection rates (pneumonia, urinary tract, and central venous line) 15.1% and 12.8%, respectively. Of the predictors studied, only duration of operation was significantly related to risk of infection.\n                The combination of fosfomycin and metronidazole was as safe and effective as that of doxycycline and metronidazole in preventing infections after elective colorectal operations.<doc-sep>A multicenter study to compare cefotetan alone with cefotetan and metronidazole as prophylaxis against infection in elective colorectal operations.<doc-sep>The role of antibiotic prophylaxis in operations upon the colon and rectum is now well recognized. In this study, the efficacy of cefotetan, a broad spectrum cephamycin antibiotic, given alone (n = 315), is compared with that of the combination of cefotetan and metronidazole (n = 300). The groups were well matched for age, sex, pathologic features and operations performed. There was no statistical difference in the incidence of operation-related infection between the two groups. We conclude that cefotetan given alone is as effective as the combination of cefotetan and metronidazole for prophylaxis against operation-related infection in elective colorectal operations.<doc-sep>Single dose imipenem-cilastatin compared with three doses of cefuroxime and metronidazole as prophylaxis in elective colorectal surgery: a prospective randomized study.<doc-sep>A prospective randomized study was performed with 61 patients undergoing elective surgery for colorectal cancer, to evaluate the prophylactic effect of two different parenteral antibiotic regimens. All patients were randomly allocated into two groups, comparable in age, sex, nutritional status and operative procedures. The patients in Group A (n. 31) received 1 g i.v. of imipenem-cilastatin at induction of anesthesia. Patients in Group B (n. 30) were given cefuroxime (1.5 g i.v.) plus metronidazole (0.5 g i.v.) at the time of anesthesia and two other administrations of the combined antibiotics (cefuroxime 0.75 g plus metronidazole 0.5 g i.v.) every 8 hours. The severity of sepsis was evaluated according to the scoring system proposed by Elebute and Stoner. No significant differences were found in terms of the rate of surgical infections: 9% in Group A and 16% in Group B. Infections not of surgical origin were found only in Group B (10.4%). These data suggest that a single dose of intravenous imipenem-cilastatin appears to be as effective as three doses of cefuroxime and metronidazole as prophylaxis against infection in elective colorectal surgery.<doc-sep>[Comparative analysis of mezlocillin/metronidazole and amoxicillin/clavulanic acid as \"one shot\" preventive antibiotic administration in colorectal interventions].<doc-sep>The prophylactic effect of intraoperative \"one shot\" antibiotic application in colorectal surgery was investigated. Patients were randomised and the antibiotic combination Mezlocillin/Metronidazole (group A) or Amoxicillin/Clavulamid acid (group B) was applicated in 160 patients. 111 patients were selected for the study (group A: 59; group B: 52 patients). In the postoperative course 53% (group A) and 67% (group B) of the patients developed bacterial infections. Abdominal wound healing was complicated by infection in 15% (A) and 12% (B) of the patients. A significant difference between the two groups could not be proven, 24% of all patients with documented intraoperative bacterial contamination and 10% of the patients with negative findings developed wound infections. In colorectal surgery patients are still at high risk for infectious complications. Applicated antibiotics should basically cover aerobic and anaerobic germs.<doc-sep>Peroperative systemic prophylaxis in colorectal surgery.<doc-sep>In an effort to reduce infection rates in elective colorectal surgery to acceptable levels without oral non-absorbable antimicrobials, using only a short course of systemic antimicrobials, 50 patients were studied in a multicentre trial. Each patient received metronidazole for anti-anaerobic coverage. The anti-aerobic coverage consisted of netilmicin, cefuroxime or placebo, administered in a double-blind manner. Five out of 36 evaluable patients had an infection at the operation site. Two patients had peritonitis (one metronidazole-netilmicin and one metronidazole-placebo) and three had a wound abscess in the abdominal wall (all metronidazole-placebo). It is concluded that a short course of peroperative systemic prophylaxis with metronidazole and netilmicin or cefuroxime--without the use of oral non-absorbable antimicrobials--gave acceptable results in the centres studied.<doc-sep>Single dose ceftriaxone as prophylaxis for sepsis in colorectal surgery.<doc-sep>During the period May 1986 to July 1989, a prospective, double blind, randomized trial of antibiotic prophylaxis in colorectal surgery was undertaken at the Royal Brisbane Hospital. Three hundred and thirty patients were considered eligible for the trial. Three regimens were compared: a combination of 2 g ceftriaxone and 1 g metronidazole; a single dose of 2 g ceftriaxone; or 1 g cefazolin and 1 g metronidazole, as antibacterial prophylaxis in colorectal surgery. Fifty patients were excluded from analysis. The overall incidence of wound sepsis was 7.9% (22 patients). There was no statistical difference in the incidence of wound infections between the three groups. The presence of drains and the non-performance of a bowel anastomosis at the time of surgery predisposed patients to wound infection. Staphylococcus aureus or Staphylococcus epidermidis were the cause of wound infection in 16 cases. Patients in the cefazolin and metronidazole group had a significantly higher number of postoperative urinary tract and respiratory tract infections than the other two groups combined (P less than 0.01). There did not appear to be any change in sensitivity patterns to ceftriaxone during the 3 year trial. During the 3 year period of the study, ceftriaxone was found to be a safe and effective drug in antibacterial prophylaxis in colorectal surgery.<doc-sep>One versus three doses of metronidazole/mezlocillin for antibiotic prophylaxis in colon surgery.<doc-sep><doc-sep>Ciprofloxacin as single-dose antibiotic prophylaxis in colorectal surgery. Results of a randomized, double-blind trial.<doc-sep><doc-sep>Prophylactic antibiotics in elective colorectal surgery.<doc-sep>A randomized prospective study was conducted on 194 patients who underwent elective colorectal surgery for carcinoma. All patients received the same mechanical bowel preparation. In addition, patients in group A received oral neomycin and erythromycin base; patients in group B received systemic metronidazole and gentamicin, while patients in group C received both oral and systemic antibiotics. Postoperative septic complications related to colorectal surgery occurred in 27.4 per cent, 11.9 per cent and 12.3 per cent respectively in groups A, B and C (chi 2 = 7; P less than 0.05). The incidence of sepsis in groups B and C was almost identical. Patients who received oral antibiotics alone (group A) had significantly higher risks of postoperative sepsis when compared with patients in either group B or group C (P less than 0.05). As there is no additional advantage of combining oral and systemic antibiotics, we recommend systemic metronidazole and gentamicin to be used with mechanical bowel preparation in elective colorectal surgery.<doc-sep>Infection prophylaxis with doxycycline in colorectal surgery. A preliminary report.<doc-sep><doc-sep>Systemic perioperative prophylaxis in elective oncological colorectal surgery: cefotetan versus clindamicin plus aztreonam.<doc-sep>A prospective randomized study was performed with 65 patients undergoing elective surgery for colorectal cancer, to evaluate the prophylactic effect of two different parenteral antibiotic regimens. All patients underwent rigorous mechanical cleansing of the bowel (enemas, laxatives), received low-residue diet 3 days pre-operatively, and were given oral metronidazole (250 mg) five times a day for 3 days preoperatively. They were divided into two groups comparable in age, nutritional status and operative procedure. The patients in group A (36) received 2 g i.v. of cefotetan at induction of anaesthesia and two other administrations every 12 h. Patients in group B (29) were given clindamicin (600 mg, i.v.) at induction of anaesthesia plus aztreonam (1 g, i.v.); two other doses of the same combined antibiotics were administered every 8 h. Five patients were excluded from the study because they underwent Miles procedure; two others because they underwent explorative laparotomy only. The overall incidence of post-operative septic complications was 6.9% (4/58). No significant differences were found in terms of the rate of surgical infections: 3.1 in group A (1/32) and 0% in group B. Urinary tract infections (1 case) and respiratory tract infections (2 cases) were observed only in group B: the rate was found to be 11.5% (3/26); two anastomotic leakages were observed in group A (6.25%) and one in group B (3.8%). These data suggest that cefotetan appears to be as effective as clindamicin plus aztreonam in prophylaxis against infection in elective colorectal surgery.<doc-sep>A comparison between amoxycillin/clavulanate and mezlocillin in abdominal surgical prophylaxis.<doc-sep>A randomized comparative study was conducted to evaluate the clinical efficacy of amoxycillin/clavulanate (Augmentin) compared with mezlocillin for the prevention of wound infection in patients undergoing abdominal surgery. There was no difference in overall wound infection rates between the amoxycillin/clavulanate treated group and the mezlocillin group. When sub-groups were examined for total infections no significant difference was seen between antibiotic groups in patients undergoing clean/potentially contaminated operations or contaminated operations, although more deep infections were encountered in the amoxycillin/clavulanate group in comparison with the mezlocillin group, in contaminated operations. The type of operation performed also failed to show any difference in those patients undergoing upper gastro-intestinal, appendiceal, colonic, or biliary operations. The infections in those receiving amoxycillin/clavulanate were largely of bowel origin and predominantly sensitive to amoxycillin/clavulanate. Those in the mezlocillin group were predominantly staphylococcal in origin. Amoxycillin/clavulanate appears to be an effective antibiotic for use as a single agent in surgical prophylaxis.<doc-sep>Prophylactic single-dose fosfomycin and metronidazole compared with neomycin, bacitracin, metronidazole and ampicillin in elective colorectal operations.<doc-sep>Two antibiotic regimens for the prophylaxis of infection after colorectal operations were compared in a prospective, double blind, randomised controlled trial in 244 patients. Ninety-five patients (39%) were either excluded before randomisation or withdrawn, leaving 149 for analysis. Group 1 (n = 72) received a single infusion of 8 g fosfomycin and 1 g metronidazole at the induction of anaesthesia. Group 2 (n = 77) received bacitracin 250 mg plus neomycin 250 mg (as four tablets on three occasions over two days), metronidazole 500 mg tablets three times a day for one day, and ampicillin 1 g intravenously at induction of anaesthesia. Nine patients in group 1 (13%), 95% confidence interval (CI) 6.9 to 22.4, developed infective complications, compared with 8 in group 2 (10%), 95% CI 4.6 to 19.4. The overall infection rate was 17 of 149 evaluable patients (11%), 95% CI 6.8 to 17.7. Seven patients died (five in group 1 and 2 in group 2), two of whom (one in each group) died as a direct result of infective complications. Long operations and obesity were the most important risk factors, and may indicate a need for longer prophylaxis. Fosfomycin, which is mainly active against aerobic bacteria, was both safe and useful when combined with metronidazole.<doc-sep>Metronidazole vs. erythromycin, neomycin, and cefazolin in prophylaxis for colonic surgery.<doc-sep>A prospective, double-blind, randomized study was undertaken to compare perioperative parenteral metronidazole and erythromycin, One neomycin, and cefazolinhundred fifty-five patients were randomized into two groups by the pharmacy department. The resulting difference between the overall septic complication rate in patients receiving erythromycin, neomycin, and cefazolin (10.9 percent) and the rate in patients receiving metronidazole alone (31.9 percent) was significant. This indicates that an antibiotic to cover aerobic bacteria should be added to the regimen when metronidazole is used.<doc-sep>Multicenter study of aztreonam in the prophylaxis of colorectal, gynecologic and urologic surgery.<doc-sep>The preliminary results of four multicenter, comparative protocols on the efficacy and safety of aztreonam are discussed. This monobactam antibiotic was used as short-term prophylaxis in patients undergoing colorectal, gynecologic or urologic surgery. When compared with gentamicin in a group of 295 patients undergoing colorectal surgery, aztreonam significantly reduced the incidence of abdominal wound infection (p less than 0.025); it also reduced the incidence of perineal wound and intra-abdominal infections, although these differences were not statistically significant. In patients undergoing abdominal and vaginal hysterectomy, aztreonam was compared with cefotaxime (both combined with clindamycin) in 170 and 142 patients, respectively. No difference in the incidence of infection was found between the two treatment regimens. In the 175 patients undergoing transurethral resection of the prostate, aztreonam was compared with placebo. The prophylactic regimen significantly reduced the number of urinary tract infections (p less than or equal to 0.0001). Its efficacy was particularly evident during the first 10 postoperative days. Side effects experienced by patients taking aztreonam were minor and similar in all three treatment groups studied. Aztreonam (alone or combined with clindamycin) offers a new and efficacious alternative to the standard antibiotic regimens currently used prophylactically in the high-risk postoperative patient.<doc-sep>Cefoxitin versus erythromycin, neomycin, and cefazolin in colorectal operations. Importance of the duration of the surgical procedure.<doc-sep>Perioperative parenteral cefoxitin was compared with oral erythromycin, neomycin and parenteral cefazolin in a prospective, double-blind, randomized evaluation of 119 patients undergoing colorectal operations. Patients receiving cefoxitin had a higher wound infection rate than patients receiving erythromycin-neomycin-cefazolin (12.5% v 3.2%, respectively, p = .06). A direct correlation existed between the duration of the operation and the infection rate. Cefoxitin prophylaxis was as effective as erythromycin-neomycin-cefazolin in patients undergoing surgical procedures of 4 hours or less (infection rates of 4.8% and 4.0%, respectively). However, for surgical procedures lasting more than 4 hours, 5 of 14 patients (37.5%) receiving cefoxitin developed a wound infection v 0 of 13 patients receiving erythromycin-neomycin-cefazolin (p less than .05). It is speculative as to whether frequent two-gram doses of cefoxitin given during the operation would provide prophylaxis equivalent to erythromycin-neomycin-cefazolin.<doc-sep>Metronidazole in the prevention of wound sepsis after elective colorectal surgery.<doc-sep><doc-sep>Effectiveness of single dose prophylaxis with cefotaxime and metronidazole compared with three doses of cefotaxime alone in elective colorectal surgery.<doc-sep>To compare three doses of cefotaxime alone with a single dose of cefotaxime and metronidazole for the prophylaxis of infection after elective colorectal operations.\n                Prospective random control trial.\n                Hillerød and Frederiksberg Hospitals, Copenhagen, Denmark.\n                660 consecutive patients who were to undergo elective colorectal operations during a 48 month period (January 1987-January 1991); 93 (14%) were withdrawn after randomisation leaving 567 for assessment.\n                Mechanical bowel preparation, and then either cefotaxime (Claforan) 2 g intravenously at induction of anaestesia and 3 and 9 hours later (n = 280) or a single dose of cefotaxime 2 g plus metronidazole (Flagyl) 1.5 g intravenously at induction of anaestesia (n = 287).\n                44 patients in the cefotaxime group developed wound infection (16%) compared with 19 (7%) in the combined group (p < 0.001). In the cefotaxime group 22 of the 241 patients who had an anastomosis developed leaks (9%) compared with 8 of the 239 in the cefotaxime/metronidazole group (3%). There were no differences in the incidence of intra-abdominal abscesses or burst abdomens. The most common organisms isolated from wounds were Escherichia coli and Bacteriodes fragilis.\n                One dose of cefotaxime and metronidazole is active against a wide range of organisms and resulted in significantly fewer wound infections than three doses of cefotaxime alone.<doc-sep>Amoxycillin and clavulanic acid versus cefotaxime and metronidazole as antibiotic prophylaxis in elective colorectal resectional surgery.<doc-sep>In a prospective randomised controlled trial, amoxycillin plus clavulanic acid was compared to a combination of cefotaxime and metronidazole as prophylactic antibiotics in 164 patients who underwent elective colorectal resectional surgery. Wound infection occurred in 15 patients (9.1%) and deep surgical infection in 4 (2.4%). Seven cases of wound infection and 2 cases of deep infection occurred in the amoxycillin plus clavulanic acid arm, while 8 cases of wound infection and 2 cases of deep infection occurred in the cefotaxime plus metronidazole arm. Eighty-eight percent of infections occurred in patients who had low anterior resection or abdominoperineal resection of the rectum. Both the amoxycillin plus clavulanic acid and the combination of cefotaxime and metronidazole offer the same degree of protection against post-operative infection. The use of amoxycillin plus clavulanic acid as antibiotic prophylaxis is recommended because of its easier use and cheaper cost.<doc-sep>Addition of parenteral cefoxitin to regimen of oral antibiotics for elective colorectal operations. A randomized prospective study.<doc-sep>The efficacy of cefoxitin, a perioperative parenteral antibiotic, combined with mechanical bowel preparation and oral antibiotics to prevent wound infections and other septic complications in patients undergoing elective colorectal operations, was examined in a prospective randomized study. All 197 patients who completed the study received mechanical bowel preparation and oral neomycin/erythromycin base. In addition a perioperative parenteral antibiotic was given in three divided doses to 101 patients. The other 96 patients received no parenteral antibiotics. The overall incidence of intra-abdominal septic complications was 7.3% (7 of 96) in the control group (no cefoxitin) and 5% (5 of 101) in the treatment group (cefoxitin). This difference was not statistically significant. The incidence of abdominal wound infection was 14.6% in the control group and 5% in the treatment group, a statistically significant difference (p = 0.02). The addition of perioperative parenteral cefoxitin greatly reduced the incidence of wound infections in patients undergoing elective colorectal operations who had been prepared with mechanical bowel cleansing and oral antimicrobial agents.<doc-sep>Amoxycillin/clavulanic acid prophylaxis in elective colorectal surgery: a prospective randomized trial.<doc-sep>In a randomized trial of 440 patients undergoing elective colorectal surgery, the prophylactic efficacy and the safety of amoxycillin/clavulanic acid were compared with that of a control regimen of clindamycin and gentamicin. Surgical wound healing was assessed by the ASEPSIS points scale; it was normal in 86% of patients and the scores for both groups were not statistically different (amoxycillin/clavulanic acid: 11.1; clindamycin + gentamicin: 10.9). Intra-abdominal infections were more frequent in the clindamycin + gentamicin arm of the study (Fisher's exact test, P = 0.035). It is concluded that amoxycillin/clavulanic acid is as effective and safe as clindamycin + gentamicin in the prevention of wound infection and may provide better protection against intra-abdominal infections.<doc-sep>[Short-term antibiotic prophylaxis in colorectal surgery: cefoxitin versus piperacillin. A double-blind randomized study, 60 cases].<doc-sep>A randomized, double-blind comparative trial of cefoxitine and piperacillin was conducted in two groups of 30 patients with a similar number of the usual risk factors. Doses of cefoxitine 2 g and piperacillin 4 g were administered only once, except in some cases when the operation lasted more than 5 hours. Analysis of the results showed that the two antibiotics had equivalent prophylactic effectiveness (congruent to 6%) in colorectal surgery.<doc-sep>[Antibiotic prophylaxis in colon surgery: cefazolin (Kefzol- ornidazole (Tiberal) versus cephazolin-placebo].<doc-sep>A prospective, randomized, double-blind and controlled clinical trial of systemic antibiotic prophylaxis with Cefazolin and Ornidazol (CO) versus Cefazolin and Placebo (CP) was carried out consecutively in 100 patients undergoing elective, colorectal surgery. The incidence of wound infection in the CP-group was 20% (n = 10) and in the CO-group 8% (n = 4) (p less than 0.10 ns). The reduction of anaerobic bacterias from 20% (n = 10) in the CP-group to 0% (n = 0) (CO) was significant (a1 = 0.0139; a2 = 0.0277 s, Fischer's exact test). The time of hospitalization was reduced from 20.3 days (CP) to 16.7 days (CO) (p less than 0.05 s). The agent for antibiotic prophylaxis in elective colorectal surgery is to cover the spectrum of anaerobic bacterias.<doc-sep>Clinical trial of prophylaxis of wound sepsis in elective colorectal surgery comparing ticarcillin with tinidazole. University of Melbourne Colorectal Group.<doc-sep>A prospective randomized single blind controlled clinical trial was undertaken to compare prophylactic therapy using a systemic antibiotic active against both aerobic and anaerobic bacteria with an oral antibiotic agent active only against anaerobic bacteria in elective colorectal surgery. One hundred and thirty-one patients received ticarcillin and 130 received tinidazole. The wound infection rate was 8% in those patients receiving ticarcillin prophylaxis and 20% in those receiving tinidazole (P less than 0.05). Multivariate analysis of the factors affecting wound infection rate showed that there were three independent factors that reached statistical significance: the prophylactic antibiotic used; the type of hospital (public or private) in which the operation was performed, and the presence of a stoma at operation. The wound infection rate in those patients receiving tinidazole prophylaxis was more than twice that reported previously by the authors. The mortality in patients receiving ticarcillin prophylaxis was 1.5% compared to 9.2% in those receiving tinidazole prophylaxis (P less than 0.05). The clinical anastomotic leakage rate was similar in each antibiotic prophylactic group, 8.6% in those receiving ticarcillin and 7.3% in those receiving tinidazole.<doc-sep>Systemic Timentin is superior to oral tinidazole for antibiotic prophylaxis in elective colorectal surgery. University of Melbourne Colorectal Group.<doc-sep>A prospective, randomized, single-blind, controlled clinical trial was undertaken to compare two different prophylactic antibiotic regimens in patients undergoing elective colorectal surgery. Systemic Timentin, a combination of ticarcillin and the beta-lactamase inhibitor clavulanic acid, was assigned to 101 patients. Oral tinidazole, an agent active only against anaerobic bacteria, was assigned to 102 patients. The wound infection rate was 2.4 percent in the patients receiving Timentin and 14 percent in those receiving tinidazole (P = 0.01). Multivariate analysis of factors affecting the wound infection rate showed that the only factor that independently reached statistical significance was the prophylactic antibiotic used. The mortality of patients receiving Timentin prophylaxis was 3.4 percent compared with 8.9 percent of those receiving tinidazole (P = 0.15). The clinical anastomotic leakage rate was 1.3 percent in patients receiving Timentin and 13 percent in those receiving tinidazole (P = 0.01). These results, together with those of two previously published clinical trials by this group, indicate that antibiotic prophylaxis in elective colorectal surgery should consist of a short course of an agent effective against both aerobic and anaerobic bowel flora.<doc-sep>Comparison of one dose versus three doses of prophylactic antibiotics, and the influence of blood transfusion, on infectious complications in acute and elective colorectal surgery.<doc-sep>In a randomized prospective controlled trial involving 311 patients undergoing acute or elective colorectal surgery, the efficacy and safety of two different single dose and one triple dose regimen of antibiotic prophylaxis, as well as the influence of blood transfusion on postoperative infectious complications, were studied. Postoperative infectious complications occurred in a total of 59 patients (19.0 per cent). There were no major differences between the three treatment groups. Thirty-four patients (10.9 per cent) developed abdominal wound infection, 17 patients (5.5 per cent) intra-abdominal abscess and 16 patients (5.1 per cent) anastomotic leakage. Of 202 patients (65.0 per cent) requiring blood transfusion during hospitalization 57 (28.2 per cent; 95 per cent confidence limits of 23-36 per cent) developed infectious complications, whereas two non-transfused patients (1.8 per cent; 95 per cent confidence limits of 0.2 to 6 per cent; P less than 0.001) developed infectious complications. It is concluded that one single dose of antibiotic prophylaxis in acute and elective colorectal surgery is as protective as a triple dose regimen. The development of infectious complications despite antibiotic prophylaxis is strongly related to blood transfusion.<doc-sep>Peri-operative infection prophylaxis with ornidazole and gentamicin in elective colonic surgery.<doc-sep>In a study of 60 patients undergoing elective colonic surgery peri-operative infection prophylaxis by the \"one-shot' method was compared with that of 48-hour duration. The antibacterial agents used were ornidazole and gentamicin. Considering the patient population as a whole, no significant differences were found in the results. All the infectious complications which occurred post-operatively were due to bacterial contamination by aerobic pathogens. No anaerobic pathogens were detected in any of the cases.<doc-sep>A prospective, randomized trial of perioperative prophylactic cefamandole in elective colorectal surgery for malignancy.<doc-sep>The impact on wound infection of the addition of perioperative cefamandole to a mechanical bowel preparation with oral antibiotics was studied in a prospective randomized series of patients undergoing elective colectomy for biopsy-proven carcinoma or adenomatous polyps. Seventy patients were randomized, all underwent mechanical bowel preparation and received oral neomycin and erythromycin base. Thirty-four patients also received a preoperative and four postoperative doses of cefamandole, while 36 patients were randomized to receive no parenteral antibiotics. The two groups were well stratified for age, sex, and risk factors. The Dukes stage was similar and the surgical procedures were equally distributed in the two groups. There were no wound infections in the 34 patients receiving cefamandole and only one wound infection (2.8 percent) in the 36 control patients. Therefore, the addition of perioperative intravenous cefamandole to a good mechanical bowel preparation with oral antibiotics was of no benefit in reducing wound infections following resection of colorectal malignancies in this select group of patients.<doc-sep>Prophylaxis with doxycycline (Vibramycin) in colorectal surgery.<doc-sep>A prospective randomized double-blind study comprising 118 patients was performed to evaluate the effects of doxycycline as a prophylactic antimicrobial in elective colonic surgery. Fifty-eight patients were treated and 60 were controls. 200 mg of active substance or placebo was given 4-6 hours before operation and 100 mg daily for the next five postoperative days. Levels of doxycycline in serum and tissues were determined and related to the MIC-values of the contaminants. A significantly lower incidence of abdominal wound sepsis, intra-abdominal complications and septicaemia was found in the doxycycline group (12.4%) compared to the controls (45%). The positive effects were most pronounced in the non-contaminated cases, and especially in the cases with negative wound culture at operation. In order to evaluate the effect of prophylaxis in clinical routine an open study comprising 182 patients was carried out. In the group of patients receiving adequate prophylaxis (159 patients) the abdominal wound sepsis rate was 8.1%. 11 other patients who had received doxycycline preoperatively for some time because of intra-abdominal infection developed wound sepsis in 63.4%. In 12 patients where incomplete or no prophylaxis was given, the wound sepsis rate was 33.2%. The frequency of abdominal septic complications did not differ between non-contaminated, 10.9%, and contaminated operations, 13.8%, partly because of the topical application of ampicillin in some of the patients belonging to the latter category. Preoperative treatment with doxycycline because of some intra-abdominal was evidently the single risk factor associated with a high septic complication rate. No adverse ecological effects were seen during the 19 months study.<doc-sep>A comparison of single-dose systemic Timentin with mezlocillin for prophylaxis of wound infection in elective colorectal surgery. University of Melbourne Colorectal Group.<doc-sep>A prospective, randomized, single-blind, controlled clinical trial was undertaken to compare two different prophylactic antibiotic single-dose regimens in patients undergoing elective colorectal surgery. Timentin, a combination of ticarcillin and clavulanic acid, was administered intravenously (3.1 g) to 87 patients. Mezlocillin, a semisynthetic penicillin was given intravenously (2.0 g) to 98 patients. The wound infection rate was 10.6 percent in patients receiving Timentin and 9.7 percent in those receiving mezlocillin (P greater than .05). Multivariate analysis of factors possibly affecting the wound infection rate showed that the presence of a colostomy preoperatively, fecal contamination at surgery, and the surgical group were the only factors that independently achieved a statistically significant association with the development of a postoperative wound infection in this trial (P less than .0001).<doc-sep>A randomized prospective study to compare cefotetan with cefuroxime plus metronidazole as prophylaxis in elective colorectal surgery.<doc-sep>This study compares the efficacy of cefotetan with the combination of cefuroxime plus metronidazole as antibiotic prophylaxis in elective colorectal surgery when given over the first 24 h postoperatively. There was no significant difference in wound infection rates between the two groups (14.7% for cefotetan and 13.9% for cefuroxime plus metronidazole), or the rates of other infective complications. Adverse reactions occurred with equal frequency in both treatment groups and no serious side effects occurred. Cefotetan is a safe and effective antibiotic for use as prophylaxis in elective colorectal surgery. Its advantages are that it is a single agent with a spectrum covering both aerobic Gram-negative rods and anaerobic organisms and, because of its long half-life, needs only to be given at 12-hourly intervals.<doc-sep>[Perioperative antibiotic prophylaxis in colon surgery. Metronidazole and tobramycin versus metronidazole alone. A prospective randomized study].<doc-sep>97 patients scheduled to undergo elective surgery for colorectal carcinoma were randomized to receive either three doses of intravenous metronidazole-e and tobramycin or three doses of intravenous metronidazole alone. The first dose was given after induction of general anesthesia, the second at 9 p.m. and the third at 6 a.m. the following day. The study was double-blind, with patients in the metronidazol-alone group given a placebo infusion instead of tobramycin. The overall postoperative infection rate was 19.6% with no statistically significant difference between the two groups. It is concluded that the addition of an aminoglycoside does not afford better protection than prophylaxis with metronidazole alone.<doc-sep>A randomized trial to compare amoxycillin/clavulanate with metronidazole plus gentamicin in prophylaxis in elective colorectal surgery.<doc-sep>A randomized controlled trial was designed to compare antibiotic prophylaxis with a standard combination of agents, metronidazole and gentamicin, with a single preparation, amoxycillin/clavulanate in 400 patients undergoing elective colorectal surgery. There were 41 patients who were excluded or withdrawn (wrong dose, inappropriate operation, established sepsis or concurrent disease). Abdominal wound sepsis occurred in 14% of the assessable patients in the amoxycillin/clavulanate group and in 15% of the metronidazole plus gentamicin group. Perineal sepsis occurred in 27% of the amoxycillin/clavulanate group with a perineal wound compared with 18% in the metronidazole plus gentamicin group. Intra-abdominal abscess occurred in 8% of those who received amoxycillin/clavulanate compared with 6% of those given metronidazole plus gentamicin. Only two patients in each group developed septicaemia. Postoperative diarrhoea occurred in 11 patients receiving amoxycillin/clavulanate compared with four given metronidazole plus gentamicin. Clostridium difficile was not isolated from the stool cultures in any of these cases. Thirteen of the 164 abdominal or perineal wounds were infected by 15 strains of Bacteroides spp. in the group receiving amoxycillin/clavulanate compared with only three of the 165 wounds in those given metronidazole plus gentamicin. (P less than 0.01). There was no other significant difference in the pattern of isolates between the groups.<doc-sep>Prevention of infection in colonic surgery by rifaximin. A controlled, prospective, randomized trial.<doc-sep><doc-sep>Prophylactic antibiotics in elective colon surgery.<doc-sep>A double-blind, randomized, prospective study comparing the efficacy of two intravenously administered antibiotics was conducted at Vancouver General Hospital on 98 patients undergoing elective colon surgery. The test drugs, erythromycin gluceptate and metronidazole, were each administered intravenously in 500 mg doses. The first dose was administered with the premedication 1 hour before surgery and the subsequent two doses were administered at 8-hour intervals. All patients received three doses of tobramycin intravenously, 1.5 mg/kg body weight, at the same time as the study drug. Fourteen patients developed wound infections, of which seven were classified as major and seven as minor infections. A major infection was diagnosed when the patient had a fever, required antibiotics, or had a prolonged hospital stay because of the wound infection. Three patients with major infections had received metronidazole and four had received erythromycin. Four patients with minor infections had received metronidazole and three patients had received erythromycin. The two treatment populations were similar with respect to type of surgery, age, gender, weight, and nutritional status. Both drugs were equally well tolerated. The overall wound infection was 14.4%, with no difference between erythromycin and metronidazole.<doc-sep>Low-dose, single-shot perioperative antibiotic prophylaxis in colorectal surgery.<doc-sep>Reductions of frequency of administration and dosage of antibiotic agents used in colorectal surgery may lower costs and the occurrence of adverse side effects. In a prospective randomized trial we evaluated two single-short regimens, a low dose of 1 g cefotiam against a standard dose of 2 g cefotiam, both in combination with 500 mg metronidazole. The low-dose group had twice the number of patients with wound sepsis (4 of 30) than the group receiving the standard antibiotic regimen (2 of 30). Two hours after infusion, the antibiotic concentrations in samples of serum, subcutaneous fatty tissue, and colonic wall of those patients receiving 1 g cefotiam were < 1 mg/l. The concentrations after administration of 2 g cefotiam were higher, as expected, and without any adverse side effects. In conclusion, we prefer infection prophylaxis by the standard dose of 2 g cefotiam plus 500 mg metronidazole in colorectal surgery.<doc-sep>Comparison of the effectiveness of moxalactam and cefazolin in the prevention of infection in patients undergoing abdominal operations.<doc-sep>Patients undergoing elective intraabdominal operations received a three-dose prophylactic regimen of either moxalactam (83 patients) or cefazolin (98 patients) in a blinded, randomized fashion. There was a 9% overall infection rate with 6% for those in the cefazolin group (6/98), and 12% for those treated with moxalactam (10/83) (p = 0.26). Infection rates stratified by types of surgery were similar for both regimens. The drugs were well tolerated, with minimal side effects. Patients at highest risk of infection were those with obstruction of upper gastrointestinal tract and those with pancreatitis. We concluded that moxalactam was no more effective than cefazolin in preventing postoperative infections in this study population.<doc-sep>Systemic prophylaxis with gentamicin-metronidazole in appendicectomy and colorectal surgery: a prospective controlled clinical study.<doc-sep>A prospective, randomized, clinical study was carried out in 188 patients undergoing appendicectomy or colorectal surgery to test the efficacy of prophylactic, parenterally-administered antibiotics in the prevention of infection. The results show the effectiveness of the association gentamicin-metronidazole (9.4% of infections), compared to the control group with no antibiotics (39.1% of infections), X2 = 14.1; P less than 0.001).<doc-sep>Short-term prophylaxis with cefotaxime in colorectal surgery. A prospective, randomized trial.<doc-sep>In a controlled, randomized study the effect of penicillin and streptomycin on postoperative septic complications in colorectal surgery (penicillin, 2 ml, IU, intramuscularly, three times daily for a period of six days and concomitantly streptomycin, 0.5 gm, intramuscularly, two times daily for a period of four days) was compared with the effect of cefotaxime, 2 gm, intravenously, three times on the day of surgery. One hundred patients completed the study: 48 were treated with penicillin and streptomycin (Group 1) and 52 with cefotaxime (Group 2). Wound infection occurred in one patient (2.1 percent) in Group 1, but not in Group 2 (0%, N.S.). Rupture of the wound occurred in one patient in each group (2.1 percent vs. 1.9 percent, N.S.). Insufficiency of the anastomosis occurred in four patients in Group 1 (8.3 percent) and in one patient in Group 2 (1.9 percent). It is concluded that short-term prophylaxis with cefotaxime is as effective as long-term prophylaxis with penicillin and streptomycin.<doc-sep>Prevention of wound infection in elective colorectal surgery by local application of a gentamicin-containing collagen sponge.<doc-sep>Preoperative antibiotic prophylaxis is known to significantly reduce the incidence of postoperative wound infection in elective colorectal surgery, and is a recognized part of surgical management. Antibiotics are usually given systemically or orally, or by a combination of the two routes. Local antibiotic delivery to the wound site using an implanted, reabsorbable, gentamicin-containing collagen sponge is a novel concept. We compared postoperative wound infection rates in 221 colorectal surgery patients randomized to receive systemic gentamicin/metronidazole with (Group I, n = 107) or without (Group II, n = 114) the gentamicin-collagen sponge. The two patient groups were identical on the basis of demographics and operations undergone. The postoperative wound infection rate was significantly lower in Group I patients than Group II 5.6% (6/107) and 18.4% (21/ 114), respectively (p < 0.01). The mean duration of hospital stay was 13.8 days in Group I and 16.3 days in Group II, which did not represent a statistically significant difference. The gentamicin collagen sponge was well tolerated and no adverse events were reported that were attributable to its use. This new method for delivering gentamicin directly to the operative site may represent a significant method for reducing postoperative wound infection rates to levels lower than those currently achieved with systemic antibiotics alone.<doc-sep>Peroperative cefoxitin. A double-blind prospective study in the prevention of wound infections.<doc-sep><doc-sep>Double-blind comparison of single-dose alatrofloxacin and cefotetan as prophylaxis of infection following elective colorectal surgery. Trovafloxacin Surgical Group.<doc-sep>Alatrofloxacin, the prodrug of trovafloxacin, is a novel fluoroquinolone antimicrobial agent with a broad spectrum, including activity against gram-positive and gram-negative aerobes and anaerobes. Its pharmacokinetic properties (long half-life, excellent tissue distribution, and good safety profile) suggest a role in surgical prophylaxis. This prospective, multicenter, double-blind trial compared alatrofloxacin with cefotetan, an approved drug for surgical prophylaxis, in reducing postoperative infections.\n                The efficacy and safety of a single 200-mg intravenous dose of alatrofloxacin were compared to a single 2-g intravenous dose of cefotetan in 492 patients undergoing elective colorectal surgery. The efficacy of alatrofloxacin as a prophylaxis for wound, intra-abdominal, or remote-site postoperative infectious complications was compared with cefotetan in 317 clinically evaluable patients; 161 received alatrofloxacin and 156 received cefotetan. The patients were monitored for infections and safety for 30 days postoperatively.\n                No statistically significant between-treatment difference was detected in successful clinical response rates at the end of the study (72% for each group). The incidence of primary wound infections at the time of hospital discharge was also similar: 21% in patients treated with alatrofloxacin and 18% in those treated with cefotetan. Safety, established by the incidence of adverse events, did not differ statistically between the groups.\n                A single intravenous dose of alatrofloxacin given within 4 hours prior to surgery was as effective as an intravenous dose of cefotetan in the prevention of postoperative infectious complications in patients undergoing elective colorectal surgery. The safety profiles of the two medications were similar.<doc-sep>A comparison between netilmicin with metronidazole and doxycycline as prophylaxis in elective colorectal surgery.<doc-sep>The aim of this study was to compare the prophylactic effects of netilmicin plus metronidazole administered for one day and of doxycycline administered for five days on the incidence of postoperative sepsis in patients undergoing elective colorectal surgery. One hundred patients were studied, 50 men and 50 women, with a mean age of 66.6 years. The patients were randomized into the two groups. Wound infections occurred in a total of 9 patients, 5 in the doxycycline group and 4 in the group given netilmicin plus metronidazole, i.e. the overall infection rate was 9%. It is concluded that there is no statistically significant difference on the incidence of postoperative wound sepsis in patients undergoing elective colorectal surgery between the group given doxycycline for five days and the group given netilmicin plus metronidazole for one day.<doc-sep>No effect of topical ampicillin prophylaxis in elective operations of the colon or rectum.<doc-sep>Whether or not topical application of ampicillin is necessary in patients undergoing elective colorectal operations was investigated. After mechanical preparation, 193 patients received 2 grams of cefotaxime administered intravenously from the start of the operation; patients received two more doses within the next 12 hours. In addition, patients were randomized to receive or not receive prophylaxis against infection of 2 grams of ampicillin in the site of the incision at closure. Twenty-three patients did not complete the study. Wound infection occurred in five of 81 patients who had topical application of ampicillin compared with six of 89 patients who did not receive prophylaxis; the difference was not significant. There were no significant differences in rates of wound dehiscence, intra-abdominal abscess or anastomotic leakage. Escherichia coli and Bacteroides fragilis were the predominant microorganisms isolated. Thus, topical application of ampicillin did not lower the wound infection rate when there was a preoperative antibiotic administered intravenously.<doc-sep>A randomized trial of one versus three doses of Augmentin as wound prophylaxis in at-risk abdominal surgery.<doc-sep>In a randomized prospective trial of prophylactic antibiotics in at-risk abdominal surgery, one dose of intravenous Augmentin (amoxycillin 250 mg and clavulanic acid 125 mg) on induction has been compared with three 8 hourly doses in 900 patients. Wound infection rates which included minor and delayed infections were very similar in those given one dose: 48/449 (10.7%) compared with those given three doses: 49/451 (10.9%) 95% confidence limits - 4.25% + 3.9%. There were more septic and sepsis-related deaths in those patients given one dose (14 deaths) than in those given three doses (7 deaths) P > 0.1 95% CL - 0.4% + 3.0%. However, there were more very elderly patients in the one dose group: 64% of the deaths were aged over 80 and all but one had an emergency operation. There was no difference in the other outcome measures studied which included non-fatal deep sepsis, length of postoperative hospital stay, duration of postoperative fever or the use of antibiotics for postoperative infection. One dose of a suitable intravenous antibiotic gives prophylaxis against wound infection in at-risk abdominal surgery which is at least as effective as multiple doses. However, there may be a risk of overwhelming systemic sepsis in very elderly patients having emergency surgery.<doc-sep>Cefotaxime i.v. versus oral neomycin-erythromycin for prophylaxis of infections after colorectal operations.<doc-sep><doc-sep>[Single-dose antibiotic prophylaxis for elective colorectal surgery. Multicenter study in Switzerland].<doc-sep><doc-sep>A comparison of the roles of cefamandole and ceftriaxone in abdominal surgery.<doc-sep>In a prospective, randomized study, we compared the ability of ceftriaxone sodium (serum half-life, 8.0 hours) and cefamandole naftate and sodium carbonate (serum half-life, 0.8 hours) to prevent wound infection in 1238 patients undergoing abdominal surgery. Prophylaxis consisted of single-dose therapy at the time of induction of anesthesia, and treatment regimens contained ceftriaxone sodium, 1 g/d intravenously, or cefamandole naftate and sodium carbonate, 1 g intravenously every 6 hours. Except for low-risk biliary procedures, cephalosporin therapy was accompanied by the administration of metronidazole. No significant difference was noted in the incidence of wound infection, ie, 5.6% for the ceftriaxone group (95% confidence interval, 3.8% to 7.4%) and 6.9% for the cefamandole group (95% confidence interval, 4.9% to 8.9%). Single-dose prophylaxis with 1 g of cefamandole naftate and sodium carbonate was relatively inexpensive and provided a cost savings of 64%. When treatment was required, a 23% cost savings was associated with the use of a once-daily dose of 1 g of ceftriaxone sodium.<doc-sep>[Perioperative antibiotic prevention in colon and rectum surgery.

The rate of postoperative wound infections was not significantly different in the groups (p = 0,09). (1/50 in Group I = 2%, 5/50 in Group II = 10%). Postoperative complications clearly occurred less frequently in the first group than in the second one (12% versus 34%, p0,01).

There was no statistically significant difference between both chemoprophylaxis groups (p = 0.10). It is concluded that the intravenous chemoprophylaxis should be preferred because of the lowest dosage and therefore the fewest side-effects.<doc-sep>A prospective, randomized, double-blind study of 10% mannitol mechanical bowel preparation combined with oral neomycin and short-term, perioperative, intravenous Flagyl as prophylaxis in elective colorectal resections.<doc-sep>The effect of 1-day mechanical bowel preparation with 10% mannitol combined with oral neomycin and short-term perioperative intravenous Flagyl (group I) was studied in a prospective, randomized, double-blind study and was compared with oral neomycin and an intravenous placebo (Group II). Thirty-one patients were evaluated in group I (Flagyl), and there was a 0% septic complication rate. Thirty-seven patients were in the neomycin placebo group (group II), which had a septic complication rate of 22%. The difference between the two groups was statistically significant. No complications were observed from either the 10% mannitol solution or the intravenous Flagyl at either clinical, hematologic, or biochemical assessment. The study indicates that 1-day mechanical bowel preparation with 10% mannitol combined with oral neomycin and short-term, perioperative, intravenous Flagyl is a safe, effective, and inexpensive method for significantly reducing the septic complications of elective colorectal surgical resections.<doc-sep>Colectomy, mucosal proctectomy, and ileal pouch-anal anastomosis. A prospective trial of optimal antibiotic management.<doc-sep>The ideal prophylactic antibiotic regimen has not been established for patients undergoing colectomy, mucosal proctectomy, and endorectal ileoanal anastomosis, a prolonged operation frequently accompanied by abdominal and pelvic contamination and associated with an infection rate up to 20%. The aim of this study was to evaluate, in a prospective, randomized, double-blind fashion, the efficacy of a short perioperative course compared to an extended postoperative course of intravenous antibiotics (cefoxitin) in patients undergoing colectomy with ileoanal anastomosis. Forty patients with ulcerative colitis or familial polyposis coli received a mechanical and oral antibiotic bowel preparation and a standard three-dose perioperative course of intravenous cefoxitin. Patients then were randomized to receive intravenous cefoxitin, 1 g every 6 hours, or placebo for 5 days. No differences in overall postoperative morbidity were observed and neither group developed intra-abdominal, pelvic, or wound infections. It is concluded that a standard three-dose perioperative course of intravenous antibiotics provides adequate prophylaxis in the prevention of infectious complications in patients undergoing colectomy, mucosal proctectomy, and ileoanal anastomosis.<doc-sep>Short-term prophylaxis with cefuroxime in colorectal surgery for cancer.<doc-sep>A controlled study of short-term prophylaxis with cefuroxime was performed on a group of 52 patients with colorectal neoplasms who underwent elective surgery. The patients were divided into two groups, A and B. Group A received the antibiotic immediately before surgery, intraincisionally and immediately after the end of operation; group B was treated only postoperatively. Each patient received a total of 5,250 mg of cefuroxime. Wound sepsis was demonstrated in 11.5% of cases of group A and 23.0% of group B (P less than 0.01); another type of sepsis was observed in 34% of group A and 11.5% of group B (P less than 0.001).

The two groups were matched for age, sex, malignancy, and type of operation. Primary wound infections were observed in one patient (3.7%) in the combination group and six (18.2%) in the group given metronidazole alone. This trend was not statistically significant. Bacteriologic examination of the anastomoses, abdominal walls, and wounds showed significantly more sterile cultures in the combination group, although more aerobic cefuroxime-resistant isolates were seen in this group. There is no evidence that the emergence of resistant strains had any influence on the outcome of patients in the study. It was concluded that an appropriate antibiotic prophylactic regimen for colorectal surgery should be directed against aerobic and anaerobic organisms.

West of Scotland Surgical Infection Study Group.<doc-sep>The controversy over the route of administration of antibiotic prophylaxis in patients undergoing elective colorectal operations persists for oral, parenteral, and a combination of the two routes. The oral antibiotics commonly administered for colorectal prophylaxis, neomycin and eythromycin base, are not absorbed in the gastrointestinal tract (GIT). However, the 4-fluoroquinolones are absorbed in the upper GIT and are excreted in part by the colonic mucosa. Their action is then to remove, or severely depress, the gram-negative aerobic bacilli leaving the anaerobic flora unaffected. This action is the principle of selective decontamination. We have assessed the efficacy of oral ciprofloxacin in a prospective randomized clinical trial in which all patients received piperacillin 4 g i.v. as single-dose parenteral prophylaxis. A group of 327 evaluable patients were randomized to receive ciprofloxacin 500 mg b.i.d. with the preoperative cathartic (group OA, n = 159) or no oral antibiotic (group NOA, n = 168). Postoperative wound infection occurred in 18 (11.3%) patients in group OA and 39 (23.2%) patients in group NOA (chi 2 = 7.2, p = 0.007). Operation-related infection of any type occurred in 23 (14.5%) patients in group OA compared with 55 (32.7%) in group NOA (chi 2 = 14.0, p = 0.0002). The median postoperative hospital stay was 11 days (interquartile range 4.5 days) for group OA and 12 days (interquartile range 8 days) for group NOA (Mann Whitney U test, p = 0.005). Ignoring the treatment group, the median postoperative hospital stay was 17 days (interquartile range 10 days) for infected patients and 11 days (interquartile range 4 days) for those not infected.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)<doc-sep>A prospective comparison of gentamicin and metronidazole and moxalactam in the prevention of septic complications associated with elective operations of the colon and rectum.<doc-sep>Bacteriologic evidence suggests that Latamoxef (moxalactam) is effective against colonic bacteria which cause infection during colonic and rectal operations. In a prospective comparative study, 86 patients undergoing colorectal operations were randomized to receive intravenously 24 hour antibiotic cover with either gentamicin and metronidazole or moxalactam. Six patients (13 per cent) in the gentamicin and metronidazole group and five (12 per cent) in the moxalactam group had wound sepsis develop. Perineal wound sepsis (31 per cent) was significantly more common than abdominal wound sepsis (7 per cent). No complications were noted from the use of moxalactam. No clinical evidence of abnormal bleeding was seen and the results of studies on coagulation and platelet function postoperatively were normal. The results suggest that moxalactam provides effective, safe prophylaxis comparable with established antibiotic combinations in patients undergoing colorectal operations.<doc-sep>Oral versus systemic antibiotic prophylaxis in elective colon surgery: a randomized study and meta-analysis send a message from the 1990s.<doc-sep>To compare the efficacy of combined oral and systemic antibiotics (combined) versus systemic antibiotics (systemic) alone in preventing surgical site infection in elective surgery of the colon, and to perform a meta-analysis of randomized studies comparing combined versus systemic antibiotics in elective colon surgery.\n                A double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trial.\n                The Queen Elizabeth Hospital, Montreal, a university-affiliated community hospital.\n                Two hundred and fifteen patients scheduled to undergo elective surgery of the colon.\n                Patients were randomized to receive neomycin and metronidazole orally (109 patients) or identical placebos (106 patients) on the final preoperative day. All were given amikacin and metronidazole intravenously just before operation. Thirteen randomized series comparing combined and systemic antibiotic prophylaxis in elective colon surgery were identified for meta-analysis.\n                Rates of postoperative surgical site infections: risk differences, risk ratios (RRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs); organisms found in the colon and wound fat at surgery, and in infected wounds.\n                Three patients in the systemic group, and 5 in the combined group were excluded. Wound infections occurred in 5 patients in the combined group but in 17 in the systemic group (p < 0.01, RR = 0.29, 95% CI 0.11-0.75). Bacteria isolated from wound infections and wound fat were similar to those found in the colon. They were more frequent in the colon in the systemic group (p < 0.001) and occurred in wound fat in the systemic group twice as often as in the combined group (p < 0.001). By stepwise logistic regression, the presence of bacteria in wound fat at surgery was the strongest predictor of postoperative wound infection (p < 0.002). In the meta-analysis, the summary weighted risk difference in surgical site infections between groups (d(w)) and the summary RR both favoured combined prophylaxis (d(w) = 0.56, 95% CI 0.26-0.86; RR = 0.51, 95% CI 0.24-0.78; p < 0.001).\n                In elective surgery of the colon combined oral and systemic antibiotics are superior to systemic antibiotics in preventing surgical site infections. Orally administered antibiotics add value by reducing bacterial loading of the colon and wound fat contamination, both associated with postoperative wound infection. Meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials reported from 1975 to 1995 supports these conclusions.<doc-sep>Perioperative infection prophylaxis in colon surgery.<doc-sep><doc-sep>Single-dose cefotetan versus multiple-dose cefoxitin as prophylaxis in colorectal surgery.<doc-sep>The safety and effectiveness of a single 2 g preoperative dose of cefotetan to reduce postoperative infectious complications after colorectal surgery was compared with multiple 2 g perioperative doses of cefoxitin in 289 patients enrolled in a multicenter trial; of the 239 evaluable patients, 164 received cefotetan and 75, cefoxitin. No statistically significant difference was detected in the successful clinical response rates for cefotetan and cefoxitin (88 percent and 92 percent, respectively). The difference in median increase in oral body temperature before and after the study (2.5 degrees F for cefotetan and 2 degrees F for cefoxitin) was statistically but not clinically significant (p = 0.03). Although nearly four times as many cefotetan patients as cefoxitin patients had surgery lasting 4 hours or more, the satisfactory bacteriologic response rates for cefotetan and cefoxitin were similar (88 percent and 93 percent, respectively). Nonobese patients and patients whose surgical procedures lasted less than 4 hours treated with either drug had significantly higher success rates (p less than 0.01). The incidence of major wound infection was approximately 8 percent for both treatment groups. Mean concentrations of cefotetan in plasma, specimens of colon, and subcutaneous fat were 128 +/- 61.8 micrograms/ml, 57.2 +/- 40.4 micrograms/g, and 26.8 +/- 19.4 micrograms/g, respectively. The incidence of adverse reactions was 12 percent for each group, and no reaction was considered treatment-related, including changes in results of clinical laboratory tests. A single 2 g preoperative dose of cefotetan was as safe and effective as multiple doses of cefoxitin in the reduction of postoperative wound infections after colorectal surgery.<doc-sep>Failure of topically applied antibiotics, added to systemic prophylaxis, to reduce perineal wound infection in abdominoperineal excision of the rectum.<doc-sep>In a prospective, randomized trial, prophylactic use of topical antibiotics in addition to systemic prophylaxis was studied in patients undergoing abdominoperineal amputation of the rectum. All patients received gentamicin 80 mg and metronidazole 500 mg intravenously at induction of anesthesia, followed by the same dose 8 hourly for 48 hours. In accordance with the randomization, half of the patients were additionally given gentamicin 160 mg + metronidazole 400 mg topically into the perineal wound at closure. Perineal wound infection appeared in 19 of the 41 patients who received both systemic and topical prophylaxis, and in 18 of the 38 with only systemic antibiotics. Cell-mediated immunity was preoperatively assessed with a skin test (Multitest) in all but three patients. Impairment of cell-mediated immunity was associated with significantly heightened rate of wound infection, and these patients did not benefit from topical antibiotics.<doc-sep>Preoperative cell-mediated immunity and duration of antibiotic prophylaxis in relation to postopertive infectious complications. A controlled trial in biliary, gastroduodenal and colorectal surgery.<doc-sep>In a prospective controlled trial, 750 patients undergoing elective biliary, gastric or colorectal surgery were randomized to receive short-term or long-term antibiotic prophylaxis--cefotaxime for biliary or gastric, and gentamicin/metronidazole for colorectal operations. In all patients, delayed cutaneous hypersensitivity was preoperatively assessed by simultaneous application of seven standardized recall antigens. Positive reaction was defined as mean diameter greater than or equal to 2 mm, anergy as no positive reaction to any antigen, and a 'score' as the sum (in mm) of all the mean diameters of positive reactions. There was no significant difference in septic complication or mortality rates following short-term vs. long-term prophylaxis. Anergy was found in 21 patients (2.8%), while 63 (8.4%) scored 2-4 and 666 (88.8%) greater than or equal to 5. The incidence of postoperative infectious complications was 25% in the patients with score less than 5 and 10% in those scoring greater than or equal to 5, and the corresponding mortality was 14.3 and 2.1% (both p less than 0.001). In the group with preoperative scores less than 5, the duration of antibiotic prophylaxis influenced neither postopertive infectious complications nor mortality.<doc-sep>Antimicrobial bowel preparation. Oral, parenteral, or both?<doc-sep>It has been suggested that wound infection rates after colorectal operations are influenced more by the presence of adequate tissue levels of antimicrobials at the time of contamination than by the extent of bacterial colonization of the intestinal lumen. There are, however, theoretical grounds for the belief that both levels are important. The authors therefore conducted a random control trial in 119 consecutive patients undergoing elective colorectal operations, comparing the results in a group receiving purely parenteral antimicrobial prophylaxis with those in one having a combined oral and parenteral regimen. The results in 83 contemporary nonrandomized patients, all of whom had the combined prophylactic regimen, are also reported. Oral bowel preparation resulted in a significantly smaller number of operation cultures showing growth of fecal gram-negative aerobes and anaerobes than did the purely parenteral regimen. There were more isolations of enterococci in the combined group but the excess did not achieve statistical significance. The rates of infective complications were higher in the parenteral than in the combined group, the difference in wound infection rates being statistically significant; the figures were 27.6 percent and 13.9 percent, respectively (P = .04). It is concluded that, in colorectal operations, it is advisable not only to ensure adequate tissue levels of antimicrobials but also to reduce the risk of endogenous bacterial infection by partially decontaminating the bowel.<doc-sep>Prophylactic antimicrobials in elective colorectal and biliary surgery.<doc-sep>In 97 patients undergoing elective biliary (44) or colorectal (53) surgery, cases were randomly allocated to receive peri-operative prophylaxis with either cefoxitin (Mefoxin; MSD) or metronidazole, penicillin and tobramycin (MPT). Sepsis occurred in 3 of the biliary cases (6,8%) and in 16 of the colorectal cases (30,2%). In the colorectal group sepsis occurred equally in patients receiving cefoxitin (22,2%) or MPT (38,5%) (P = 0,20). Patients who developed sepsis did not have a prolonged hospital stay; strict criteria were used to define sepsis in this study and this explains the apparently high sepsis rate. A positive wound culture at the end of the operation was more common after colorectal surgery (30,2%) than after biliary surgery (4,6%) and was associated with a higher subsequent infection rate (P = 0,02).<doc-sep>Imipenem prophylaxis in elective colorectal surgery.<doc-sep>In a randomized controlled study of 411 patients undergoing elective colorectal surgery, the efficacy and safety of two different regimens of imipenem were compared with those of a control regimen of cefuroxime plus metronidazole. Surgical infections occurred in 92 (26.4 per cent) of 349 evaluable patients. There were no major differences between the three treatment groups. It is concluded that imipenem is as effective as cefuroxime plus metronidazole in the prevention of sepsis after elective colorectal procedures.<doc-sep>24-hour systemic antimicrobial prophylaxis with gentamicin and metronidazole, or metronidazole alone, in elective colorectal surgery after mechanical bowel preparation with mannitol and whole gut irrigation.<doc-sep>In a prospective randomized trial, systemic antimicrobial prophylaxis with metronidazole and gentamicin was compared to the administration of metronidazole alone in elective colorectal surgery. In both groups, an identical mechanical large-bowel preparation was performed. In order to reduce the duration of the whole-gut irrigation, a 10% mannitol solution was administered before the irrigation procedure. Although no serious infections were observed in either group, the incidence of superficial wound infections was relatively high: 19% in the group with metronidazole and gentamicin prophylaxis and 25% in the other group. From all these wounds E. coli was isolated, and no obligate anaerobic bacteria were cultured. This high rate of wound infections is most likely caused by an overgrowth of E. coli after irrigation, due to the residues of mannitol in the colon, which serve as a nutrient for E. coli. It is concluded that mannitol should not be used in the preoperative mechanical preparation of the large bowel before elective colorectal surgery.<doc-sep>A comparison of aztreonam/metronidazole and cefotaxime/metronidazole in elective colorectal surgery: antimicrobial prophylaxis must include gram-positive cover.<doc-sep>Aztreonam/metronidazole and cefotaxime/metronidazole were compared in a prospective trial in 154 patients undergoing elective colorectal surgery. Three antibiotic doses were given over 16 hours. A significant excess of wound sepsis in the aztreonam group was seen (23/71 vs 9/70 chi 2 6.60; P less than 0.01). Sepsis was almost invariably due to Gram-positive organisms and, in particular, Staphylococcus aureus.<doc-sep>Comparison of prophylactic ampicillin/sulbactam with gentamicin and metronidazole in elective colorectal surgery: a randomized clinical study.<doc-sep>A randomized control clinical study was conducted to compare the effectiveness of prophylactic ampicillin/sulbactam in preventing wound infection after elective colorectal surgery with a combination of gentamicin and metronidazole. Over a 2-year period, 143 patients were recruited, but 15 patients were subsequently excluded due to the use of additional antibiotics for the treatment of pulmonary or urinary infection or early postoperative death without wound infection. Of the 128 evaluable patients, six of the 63 patients (9.5%) in the ampicillin/sulbactam group and seven of the 65 patients (10.7%) in the gentamicin and metronidazole group developed wound infection. We conclude that prophylactic ampicillin/sulbactam is effective in reducing the risk of wound infection following colorectal surgery.<doc-sep>Single-dose chemoprophylaxis in elective colorectal surgery. A comparison between doxycycline plus metronidazole and doxycycline.<doc-sep>In a prospective, randomized double-blind study either 400 mg of doxycycline + 1500 mg of metronidazole (D + M) or 400 mg of doxycycline (D) alone were given intravenously as a single preoperative dose to patients admitted for elective colorectal surgery. A comparison of the rate of postoperative septic complications was made. After excluding drop-out patients, 261 patients remained for evaluation. In 135 patients with D + M treatment there were four postoperative septic complications (3.0%). In 126 patients with D treatment 20 septic complications related to the surgical procedure occurred (15.9%). The difference is highly significant (p less than 0.005). Most postoperative infections were superficial wound infections (14 of 24 patients), and the mean hospital stay in the two treatment groups was equal. Bacteriologic studies showed a highly significant reduction in anaerobes in cultures from perioperative intra-abdominal fluid in the D + M treatment group. The study has thus showed that the addition of metronidazole, an efficient agent against anaerobic bacteria, to an antimicrobial agent against aerobic bacteria significantly reduces postoperative septic complications in elective colorectal surgery.<doc-sep>Comparison between oral and systemic antibiotics and their combined use for the prevention of complications in colorectal surgery.<doc-sep>Ninety patients were included in this prospective randomized trial. Each required electric colorectal surgery and was prepared for operation with oral preoperative antibiotic therapy, systemic peroperative therapy, or by a combination of both. The number of each type of septic postoperative complication and their total did not differ between the group treated by oral antibiotics prior to operation and the group treated peroperatively with systemic antibiotic therapy. The total number of septic complications (wall abscesses, fistulas, subdiaphragmatic abscesses, septicemia, peritonitis), however, was significantly less (P less than 0.05) in the group treated by both preoperative oral antibiotics and peroperative systemic antibiotic therapy (3.3 per cent) than in either groups treated only orally preoperatively (30 per cent) or by systemic antibiotic therapy during the operation (23 per cent). The combination of oral antibiotic therapy prior to operation and of systemic peroperative antibiotic therapy, therefore, presents the most effective prophylactic effectiveness.<doc-sep>Cefmetazole versus cefoxitin in prevention of infections after abdominal surgery.<doc-sep>Patients undergoing elective abdominal surgery were randomized to receive cefmetazole or cefoxitin in a three-dose perioperative prophylactic regimen. There were three infections in 89 evaluable patients receiving cefmetazole. There were six infections in 39 patients receiving cefoxitin. Both regimens were acceptable with minimal toxicity.<doc-sep>Prospective, randomised study on antibiotic prophylaxis in colorectal surgery. Is it really necessary to use oral antibiotics?<doc-sep>The use of prophylactic antibiotics in addition to mechanical cleansing is the current standard of care prior to colonic surgery. The question of whether the antibiotics should be administered intravenously or orally, or by both routes, remains controversial. Our aim was to compare three methods of prophylactic antibiotic administration in elective colorectal surgery.\n                Three hundred consecutive elective colorectal resections were studied. All patients had preoperative mechanical colon cleansing with oral sodium phosphate and intravenous antibiotic prophylaxis with cefoxitin (one dose before skin incision and two postoperative doses). Patients were randomised to one of the following three groups: group A: three doses of oral antibiotic (neomycin and metronidazole) at the time of mechanical colon cleansing; group B: one dose of oral antibiotic; group C: no oral antibiotics. All patients were followed during their hospital stay and at 7, 14 and 30 days post-surgery.\n                Vomiting occurred in 31%, 11% and 9% of the studied patients (groups A, B and C, respectively) (p<0.001). Nausea was present in 44%, 18% and 13% of patients (p<0.001). Abdominal pain was recorded in 13%, 10% and 4% of patients (p: 0.077). Wound infection was present in 7%, 8% and 6% and suture dehiscence occurred in 2%, 2% and 3% of the patients in the three groups (no differences among them). Neither were differences found among the three groups in terms of urinary infections, pneumonia, postoperative ileus or intra-abdominal abscess.\n                The addition of three doses of oral antibiotics to intravenous antibiotic prophylaxis is associated with lower patient tolerance in terms of increased nausea, vomiting and abdominal pain, and has shown no advantages in the prevention of postoperative septic complications. Therefore, we recommend that oral antibiotics should not be used prior to colorectal surgery.<doc-sep>Use of peroperative cefoxitin to prevent infection after colonic and rectal surgery.<doc-sep>A double-blind, controlled trial was performed to assess the effect of a short intraoperative course of Cefoxitin, a new broad spectrum cephamycin antibiotic, on the incidence of septic complications following elective colonic and rectal surgery. In addition to a two-day preoperative bowel preparation, patients entered in the study received a short course of either Cefoxitin (three 2g intravenous bolus doses at two-hour intervals, the first before skin incision) or a matching placebo. Thirty-two patients received Cefoxitin and 33 patients received the placebo. Postoperative abdominal wound infections developed in one (3%) of the Cefoxitin-treated patients and nine (27%) of the placebo-treated patients. This difference is statistically significant (p = 0.01). Septic complications remote from the abdominal wound, e.g. intra-abdominal abscesses, occurred in both Cefoxitin-treated and placebo-treated patients, but numbers were too small for meaningful analysis. The study shows that even a very short peroperative course of Cefoxitin is highly effective in reducing postoperative abdominal wound infections after elective colorectal surgery.<doc-sep>Single dose cefotaxime plus metronidazole versus three dose cefuroxime plus metronidazole as prophylaxis against wound infection in colorectal surgery: multicentre prospective randomised study.<doc-sep>To establish whether a single preoperative dose of cefotaxime plus metronidazole was as effective as a standard three dose regimen of cefuroxime plus metronidazole in preventing wound infection after colorectal surgery.\n                Prospective randomised allocation to one of two prophylactic antibiotic regimens in a parallel group trial. Group sequential analyses of each 250 patients were performed.\n                14 District general and teaching hospitals.\n                1018 Adults having colorectal operations were randomised, of whom 943 were evaluated. Demographic features, conditions requiring surgery, and operative procedures were similar in the two groups. Most patients had surgery for carcinoma of the colon or rectum.\n                Group 1 received cefotaxime 1 g intravenously plus metronidazole 500 mg intravenously preoperatively. Group 2 received cefuroxime 1.5 g intravenously plus metronidazole 500 mg intravenously preoperatively, followed by cefuroxime 750 mg intravenously plus metronidazole 500 mg intravenously eight hours and 16 hours postoperatively.\n                Development of surgical wound infection (as evidenced by the presence of pus), death, or discharge from hospital.\n                Wound condition was scored on a five point scale on alternate days until discharge or for up to 20 days postoperatively. Wound infection rates were: group 1, 32/453 (7.1%; 95% confidence interval 4.7% to 9.4%); group 2, 33/454 (7.3%; 95% confidence interval 4.9% to 9.6%). Death rates (group 1: 26/470 (5.5%); group 2: 31/471 (6.6%], the incidence of postoperative complications, the median duration of hospital stay (12 days), and antibiotic tolerance were all similar in the two groups. Pooled data from groups 1 and 2 showed that wound infections were more frequent when minor faecal contamination had occurred at operation and when the duration of operation exceeded 90 minutes (greater than 90 min 11.2% of cases; less than 90 min 4.8%) and were associated with an extended hospital stay.\n                A single preoperative dose of cefotaxime plus metronidazole is an efficacious as a three dose regimen of cefuroxime plus metronidazole in preventing wound infection after colorectal surgery and has practical advantages in eliminating the need for postoperative antibiotics.<doc-sep>[Infection prevention in elective large intestine surgery. Results of a prospective randomized comparative study].<doc-sep>In a prospective randomized trial clinical results of orthograde bowel lavage alone (group I) versus combined bowel lavage and parenteral antibiotic prophylaxis with 4 gm Cefoxitin (group II) in two separate dosages (perioperative short-term-prophylaxis) are compared with regard to the reduction of septic complications after colorectal surgery. Septic wound complications were 11/27 = 41% in group I and 2/30 = 7% in group II. The rate of anastomotic leakages was significantly different in the two groups (5/27 in group I, 0 in group II). The monetary costs for given antibiotics and the duration of hospitalization were less in group II. Orthograde bowel lavage alone proved to be of no effect in reducing the rate of septic complications when used without antibiotic perioperative short-term-prophylaxis and therefore cannot be recommended to be used solely.<doc-sep>A multicenter randomized trial of prophylaxis with intravenous cefepime + metronidazole or ceftriaxone + metronidazole in colorectal surgery. The 230 Study Group.<doc-sep>We compared two prophylactic antimicrobial regimens in 615 patients undergoing elective colorectal surgical procedures. Patients ranged in age from 19 to 92 years (median 66 years); the majority were male (54.0%) and most (77.7%) had neoplastic disease. All underwent mechanical bowel preparation. Patients were randomized to receive preoperative infusions of 2 g cefepime (n=307) or 2 g ceftriaxone (n=308), followed by 500 mg metronidazole. Patients were followed for up to 4 to 6 weeks after surgery. Antimicrobial prophylaxis was successful in preventing primary site infections in 92.8% of patients in the cefepime + metronidazole arm and 92.9% of patients in the ceftriaxone + metronidazole arm. Both regimens were well tolerated. A single dose of cefepime + metronidazole thus seems to be a very useful alternative to other regimens for prophylaxis in patients undergoing colorectal surgery.<doc-sep>The value of the prophylactic use of doxycycline and tinidazole in elective colorectal surgery.<doc-sep>The present study was undertaken in order to compare the effect of different antimicrobial regimens on the incidence of postoperative wound infections after elective colorectal surgery. The series consists of 84 patients, randomized in the following three groups: Group I was treated with bacitracin/neomycin tablets during the 3 days immediately prior to operation. Group II received doxycycline 200 mg orally 12-18 hours preoperatively and 200 mg intravenously during the subsequent 4 days. Group III is identical with group II, but in addition, 2 grams of tinidazole were given orally as a single dose 12-18 hours preoperatively. The ordinary preoperative treatment with low residue diet and bowel cleansing was the same for all groups. The wound infection rate was 37% (10 patients) in group I, 18.2% (6 patients) in group II, and 8.3% (2 patients) in group III. No serious side effects were observed in any of the groups.<doc-sep>24-hour systemic antibiotic prophylaxis in large-bowel surgery.<doc-sep>In a prospective randomized double-blind trial the effect of a short prophylactic course of a systemically administered antibiotic combination was studied in a series of 53 consecutive patients undergoing elective colorectal surgery. Bowel preparation was performed conventionally with cathartics and saline enemas or with an elementary diet. Patients of both preparation groups were randomly divided into a treatment group and a control group. Treated patients received 3 doses of kanamycin 500 mg plus clindamycin 600 mg intramuscularly. Four patients were withdrawn from the study for various reasons, leaving 49 patients for analysis. Wound infections were regarded as slight (grade I) or clinically important (grade II). The frequency of all wound infections (grade I + grade II) was 8% in the treatment group (25 patients) versus 66.7% in the control group (24 patients). The frequency of the grade II wound infections alone was 4.0% versus 54.7%. The difference was significant in both cases (p less than 0.0005).<doc-sep>A trial of mezlocillin versus cefuroxime with or without metronidazole for the prevention of wound sepsis after biliary and gastrointestinal surgery.<doc-sep>A randomized controlled trial was undertaken to compare the role of mezlocillin, as the sole prophylactic agent, with a combination of cefuroxime and metronidazole in patients undergoing biliary and gastrointestinal surgery. No difference in wound infection rates was seen in patients following appendicectomy, biliary or gastro-oesophageal surgery. A significantly higher wound infection rate was seen in patients undergoing colorectal surgery who received mezlocillin alone (30.2%) compared with those receiving cefuroxime and metronidazole (11.5%): this rate was similar to that of historical placebo controls in other units. The wound infections seen in patients receiving mezlocillin alone were polymicrobial involving organisms of faecal origin, including non-sporing anaerobes which were predominantly sensitive to mezlocillin. Infections due to Staphylococcus aureus, resistant to mezlocillin, were more frequent in patients receiving mezlocillin and usually secondary in nature. We conclude that mezlocillin may be an effective sole prophylactic agent in appendicectomy but not in colorectal surgery; the possible reasons for failure to adequately prevent infection, following colorectal surgery, are discussed.<doc-sep>Comparison of systemic prophylaxis with metronidazole/placebo and metronidazole/fosfomycin in colorectal surgery. A clinical study demonstrating the need for additional anti-aerobic prophylactic cover.<doc-sep>The aim of this randomized double-blind study comparing the efficacy of two prophylactic regimens, metronidazole/placebo (n = 23) and metronidazole/fosfomycin (n = 26) was two-fold. First, to evaluate the need for anti-aerobic cover in addition to short-term systemic administration of metronidazole against anaerobes in colorectal surgery. Secondly, to explore the prophylactic effect of fosfomycin on aerobes of intestinal origin. An unacceptably high rate of surgical sepsis (16.3%) forced premature conclusion of the study after 49 patients had entered it. All surgical and remote infections occurred in the metronidazole/placebo group and were caused solely by aerobes. Anaerobic sepsis was not seen at all and the surgical infection rate was 34.8%. No septic complications occurred in the 26 patients (0%) receiving metronidazole/fosfomycin (p less than 0.01). Thus the study demonstrated both the need to administer an effective anti-aerobic agent in addition to metronidazole in colorectal surgery and the efficacy of fosfomycin in preventing aerobic sepsis of intestinal origin. Adverse reactions to the two drugs were not observed and resistance did not occur.<doc-sep>",

We aimed to determine whether donepezil produces worthwhile improvements in disability, dependency, behavioural and psychological symptoms, carers' psychological wellbeing, or delay in institutionalisation. If so, which patients benefit, from what dose, and for how long?\n                565 community-resident patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease entered a 12-week run-in period in which they were randomly allocated donepezil (5 mg/day) or placebo. 486 who completed this period were rerandomised to either donepezil (5 or 10 mg/day) or placebo, with double-blind treatment continuing as long as judged appropriate. Primary endpoints were entry to institutional care and progression of disability, defined by loss of either two of four basic, or six of 11 instrumental, activities on the Bristol activities of daily living scale (BADLS). Outcome assessments were sought for all patients and analysed by logrank and multilevel models.\n                Cognition averaged 0.8 MMSE (mini-mental state examination) points better (95% CI 0.5-1.2; p<0.0001) and functionality 1.0 BADLS points better (0.5-1.6; p<0.0001) with donepezil over the first 2 years. No significant benefits were seen with donepezil compared with placebo in institutionalisation (42% vs 44% at 3 years; p=0.4) or progression of disability (58% vs 59% at 3 years; p=0.4). The relative risk of entering institutional care in the donepezil group compared with placebo was 0.97 (95% CI 0.72-1.30; p=0.8); the relative risk of progression of disability or entering institutional care was 0.96 (95% CI 0.74-1.24; p=0.7). Similarly, no significant differences were seen between donepezil and placebo in behavioural and psychological symptoms, carer psychopathology, formal care costs, unpaid caregiver time, adverse events or deaths, or between 5 mg and 10 mg donepezil.\n                Donepezil is not cost effective, with benefits below minimally relevant thresholds.

Patients were randomized in an approximately 2:1 ratio to donepezil, 5 mg/d, for the first 6 weeks, with a forced escalation to 10 mg/d thereafter (n = 96), or placebo (n = 57). The primary efficacy measure was the modified Alzheimer Disease Assessment Scale-cognitive subscale. Secondary efficacy measures included the Mini-Mental State Examination, the Computerized Memory Battery Test, the Clinical Dementia Rating Scale-Sum of the Boxes, the Patient Global Assessment Scale, and the Apathy Scale.\n                Improvements favoring donepezil on the Alzheimer Disease Assessment Scale-cognitive subscale were found at weeks 12 and 24 and at the end point (last observation carried forward); treatment differences were 1.9 (P = .03), 2.3 (P = .008), and 2.3 (P = .001) points, respectively. Improvements favoring donepezil on the Mini-Mental State Examination were found at weeks 6, 12, and 24 and at the end point (last observation carried forward); treatment differences were 1.4 (P = .02), 1.2 (P = .04), 1.4 (P = .03), and 1.8 (P = .002) points, respectively. Donepezil-treated patients showed greater mean improvement compared with placebo-treated patients on the following Computerized Memory Battery Test subscales: facial recognition (P = .007 in the intent-to-treat population and P = .04 in the fully evaluable population), first and last name total acquisition (P = .02), and name-face association delayed recall (P = .04). Donepezil was safe and well tolerated in this population; serious adverse events occurred in similar numbers of donepezil- and placebo-treated patients.\n                These data suggest significant treatment benefits of donepezil in early-stage Alzheimer disease, supporting the initiation of therapy early in the disease course to improve daily cognitive functioning.<doc-sep>Open-label, multicenter, phase 3 extension study of the safety and efficacy of donepezil in patients with Alzheimer disease.<doc-sep>Donepezil hydrochloride is a selective acetylcholinesterase inhibitor approved for the symptomatic treatment of mild to moderately severe Alzheimer disease (AD).

Benefits on Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-cognitive subscale scores for patients who received 10 mg/d in the double-blind study were evident compared with the other groups for 108 weeks of open-label treatment. In contrast, donepezil-associated benefits were lost after the 6-week placebo washout, and scores decreased below original baseline values for all patient groups. Although scores improved relative to the new open-label study baseline scores after drug use was restarted, patients remained below original baseline values. The most common adverse events were associated with the nervous and digestive systems and were generally mild and transient; 17% of patient discontinuations were associated with adverse events.\n                Donepezil is an effective and safe drug for the long-term symptomatic treatment of mild to moderately severe AD for up to 144 weeks (2.8 years), and sustained treatment may confer some advantages.<doc-sep>The effects of donepezil in Alzheimer's disease - results from a multinational trial.<doc-sep>Donepezil has been shown to be well tolerated and to improve cognition and global function in patients with mild to moderately severe Alzheimer's disease (AD). The current trial was undertaken to investigate further the efficacy and safety of donepezil, in a multinational setting, in patients with mild to moderately severe AD. This 30-week, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study consisted of a 24-week, double-blind treatment phase followed by a 6-week, single-blind, placebo washout. Eight hundred and eighteen patients with mild to moderately severe AD were randomly allocated to treatment with single, daily doses of 5 or 10 mg donepezil, or placebo. The two primary efficacy measures were: a cognitive performance test, the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-cognitive subscale (ADAS-cog) and a global evaluation, the Clinician's Interview-Based Impression of Change with caregiver input (CIBIC plus). Secondary outcome measures included the Sum of the Boxes of the Clinical Dementia Rating Scale (CDR-SB), a modified Interview for Deterioration in Daily living activities in Dementia (IDDD) and a patient rated quality of life assessment. Statistically significant improvements in cognitive and global function were observed, as evaluated by ADAS-cog and CIBIC plus, respectively, in both the 5 and 10 mg/day donepezil groups, compared with placebo. Treatment-associated changes were also observed in functional skills, as shown by improved scores on the CDR-SB and the complex-tasks component of the IDDD. A dose-response effect was evident, with the 10 mg/day donepezil group demonstrating greater benefits in all outcome measures than the 5 mg/day group. Donepezil was well tolerated by this patient population and did not produce any clinically significant laboratory test abnormalities. The results of this study confirm that donepezil is effective and well tolerated in treating the symptoms of mild to moderately severe AD.<doc-sep>Efficacy of donepezil on maintenance of activities of daily living in patients with moderate to severe Alzheimer's disease and the effect on caregiver burden.<doc-sep>This study investigated the efficacy of donepezil treatment on activities of daily living (ADLs) and social functioning in patients with moderate to severe Alzheimer's disease (AD) and the possible benefits of this treatment on caregiving time and stress levels.\n                Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multinational study.\n                Patients resided in the community or in assisted living facilities who did not require skilled 24-hour nursing care.\n                Two hundred ninety patients with moderate to severe AD (baseline standardized Mini-Mental State Examination score of 5-17).\n                Donepezil (5 mg/d for 4 weeks and 10 mg/d per clinician's judgment thereafter) or placebo for 24 weeks.\n                ADLs were assessed using the Disability Assessment for Dementia (DAD), the modified instrumental activities of daily living (IADL) scale (IADL+), and the modified Physical Self Maintenance Scale (PSMS+). Caregiver time spent assisting patients with basic and instrumental ADLs was recorded as part of the IADL+ and PSMS+ scales. Patients' social behavior was evaluated through the use of a caregiver diary that captured observations of patients' motivation, interactions, and engagement. Caregivers were evaluated for their levels of caregiver stress with a modified, multiple-item Caregiver Stress Scale (CSS). For each outcome measure, the mean change from baseline at Week 24 using a last observation carried forward (LOCF) analysis was calculated.\n                IADL+ and PSMS+ mean change from baseline scores for donepezil-treated patients showed a slower decline during the study than placebo-treated patients (Week 24 LOCF mean treatment differences: IADL+ = 6.83, P <.0001; PSMS+ = 1.32, P =.0015). Significant differences between the groups in favor of donepezil were observed on the DAD for instrumental and basic ADLs and on the three components required for the completion of each ADL: initiation, planning and organization, and effective performance. At baseline, caregivers of patients treated with donepezil (n = 141) did not differ significantly from caregivers of patients treated with placebo (n = 146) with respect to demographics or mean total scores on the CSS. At Week 24 LOCF, the overall distribution of caregiver ratings on each of the three caregiver diary items favored donepezil-treated patients over placebo-treated patients (P <.005). At Week 24 LOCF, mean change from baseline scores for CSS total and individual domain scores (all domains except caregiving competence, personal gain, and management of distress) were better for caregivers of donepezil-treated patients than for those of placebo-treated patients (CSS total, mean treatment difference = 1.82). Caregivers of donepezil-treated patients reported spending less time assisting with ADLs than caregivers of placebo-treated patients (mean difference = 52.4 min/d).\n                Donepezil demonstrated a significantly slower decline than placebo in instrumental and basic ADLs in these patients with moderate to severe AD. The ADL benefits in AD patients treated with donepezil were associated with less caregiving time and lower levels of caregiver stress.<doc-sep>Clinical efficacy and safety of donepezil on cognitive and global function in patients with Alzheimer's disease. A 24-week, multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled study in Japan. E2020 Study Group.<doc-sep>This study evaluated efficacy and safety of donepezil hydrochloride (donepezil) at 5 mg/day in patients with mild to moderately severe Alzheimer's disease for 24 weeks in a double-blind, placebo-controlled comparative trial. In this study, 268 patients were enrolled and 39 of these (15%) were withdrawn. In the evaluable population of efficacy, Protocol-Compatible (PC) analyzed patients (n = 228), better effects than that of placebo were confirmed using two primary efficacy measures: a cognitive performance test, the Japanese version of the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale - cognitive subscale (ADAS-J cog, p = 0.003) and a clinical global assessment, the Japanese version of the Clinical Global Impression of Change (J-CGIC, p = 0.000). The superiority of donepezil was also shown by secondary measures: the Sum of the Boxes of the Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR-SB), the Mental Function Impairment Scale (MENFIS) and the caregiver-rated modified Crichton scale (CMCS). The same results were obtained in the intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis (n = 263). The incidence of drug-related adverse events was 10% (14/136) in the donepezil and 8% (10/131) in the placebo group; no significant difference was seen between the two groups. The main adverse events were gastrointestinal symptoms, and these were almost all mild, and they all disappeared with continued administration or temporary discontinuation of donepezil. These results indicate that the donepezil appears to be effective and well tolerated in patients with mild to moderately severe Alzheimer's disease.\n                Copyright 2000 S.

Scores returned toward baseline within 3 weeks of drug washout. There was no associated change in caregiver-rated global impression (donepezil vs placebo: proportion improved, 0.24 vs 0.22; proportion worsened, 0.27 vs 0.35; P = .34) or on specific tests of explicit memory or verbal fluency. Contrary to studies with tacrine, the presence of the apolipoprotein E epsilon4 allele did not predict donepezil treatment failure. Most common adverse events related to donepezil therapy were nausea (5 patients), diarrhea (3 patients), and agitation (3 patients). Serious events possibly related to drug use were seizure, pancreatitis, and syncope (1 patient each).\n                This independent confirmation of data from phase 3 trials suggests that donepezil therapy modestly improves cognition in patients with Alzheimer disease who are encountered in clinical practice.<doc-sep>",
         "People with mild, moderate or severe dementia due to Alzheimer's disease treated for periods of 12, 24 or 52 weeks with donepezil experienced benefits in cognitive function, activities of daily living and behaviour. Study clinicians rated global clinical state more positively in treated patients, and measured less decline in measures of global disease severity. There is some evidence that use of donepezil is neither more nor less expensive compared with placebo when assessing total health care resource costs. Benefits on the 10 mg/day dose were marginally larger than on the 5 mg/day dose. Taking into consideration the better tolerability of the 5 mg/day donepezil compared with the 10 mg/day dose, together with the lower cost, the lower dose may be the better option. The debate on whether donepezil is effective continues despite the evidence of efficacy from the clinical studies because the treatment effects are small and are not always apparent in practice.",

MOXI-AF was designed to optimize the treatment regimen for bacterial conjunctivitis for the convenience of the patient with twice-daily dosing.\n                A safety and efficacy clinical study was conducted as a multicenter, vehiclecontrolled, randomized, double-masked, parallel group study in clinically diagnosed bacterial conjunctivitis patients aged >28 days. MOXI-AF or its vehicle was dosed one drop twice-daily for 3 days. Microbiological specimens were obtained from affected eyes on day 1, prior to the initial dose, and on day 4 after 3 days of dosing, and processed using routine clinical microbiology laboratory methods. All recovered bacteria were identified to the species level.\n                This paper reports on the microbiological success rate, a secondary efficacy variable in the trial. All patients (1180) were randomized to treatment. Patient age ranged from 30 days to 92 years. The microbiological success rate for patients treated topically with MOXI-AF twice-daily for 3 days was 74.5%, compared with 56.0% of patients treated with its vehicle control (P<0.0001). MOXI-AF was also statistically more effective than vehicle in eradicating the three principle conjunctivitis pathogens, Haemophilus influenzae (98.5% vs. 59.6%, respectively), Streptococcus pneumoniae (86.4% vs. 50.0%, respectively), and Staphylococcus aureus (94.1% vs. 80.0%, respectively) (P<0.001).\n                The xanthan gum-based 0.5% moxifloxacin ophthalmic formulation, MOXI-AF, provides effective eradication of the three principle causative pathogens of bacterial conjunctivitis across all age groups when dosed twice-daily for 3 days.<doc-sep>The treatment of acute infectious conjunctivitis with fusidic acid: a randomised controlled trial.<doc-sep>Acute infectious conjunctivitis is a common disorder in primary care. Despite a lack of evidence regarding the effectiveness of topical antibiotics for the treatment of acute infectious conjunctivitis, most patients presenting in primary care with the condition receive topical antibiotics. In The Netherlands, fusidic acid is most frequently prescribed.\n                To assess the effectiveness of fusidic acid gel compared to placebo for acute infectious conjunctivitis.\n                Double-blind randomised placebo-controlled trial.\n                Twenty-five Dutch primary care centres.\n                Adults presenting with a red eye and either (muco)purulent discharge or glued eyelid(s) were allocated to either one drop of fusidic acid gel 1% or placebo, four times daily during one week. The main outcome measure was the difference in recovery rates at 7 days. Secondary outcome measures were difference in bacterial eradication rates, a survival time analysis of the duration of symptoms, and the difference in recovery rates in culture-positive and culture-negative patients.\n                One hundred and eighty-one patients were randomised and 163 patients were analysed. Forty-five of the 73 patients in the treatment and 53 of the 90 patients in the placebo group recovered (adjusted risk difference = 5.3% [95% confidence interval {CI} = -11 to 18]). There was no difference between the median duration of symptoms in the two groups. At baseline, the prevalence of a positive bacterial culture was 32% (58/181). The bacterial eradication rate was 76% in the treatment and 41% in the placebo group (risk difference = 35% [95% CI = 9.3 to 60.4]). In culture positive patients, the treatment effect tended to be strong (adjusted risk difference = 23% [95% CI = -6 to 42]).\n                At 7 days, cure rates in the fusidic acid gel and placebo group were similar, but the confidence interval was too wide to clearly demonstrate their equivalence. These findings do not support the current prescription practices of fusidic acid by GPs.<doc-sep>Efficacy of topical antibiotic therapy in acute conjunctivitis in children.<doc-sep>We studied 102 children aged 1 month to 18 years in a randomized, double-blind trial designed to determine both the natural history of bacterial conjunctivitis and whether topical antibiotic therapy is beneficial. Affected eyes were treated four times a day for 7 days with drug (polymyxin-bacitracin ophthalmic ointment) or placebo. Eighty-four patients had proved bacterial conjunctivitis (Haemophilus influenzae 61, Streptococcus pneumoniae 22, both one); 66 of these received only topical therapy. By 3 to 5 days, 21 of 34 (62%) patients receiving topical antibiotic were clinically cured, whereas only nine of 32 (28%) patients given placebo were cured (P less than 0.02). By 8 to 10 days, 31 (91%) of the patients given antibiotic and 23 (72%) of the placebo group were cured (P = NS). The bacterial pathogen was eradicated by day 3 to 5 in 71% and by day 8 to 10 in 79% of patients given antibiotic, compared to 19% and 31% of the placebo group (P less than 0.001). Acute bacterial conjunctivitis is a self-limited disease, but topical antibiotic therapy with polymyxin-bacitracin shortens the duration of clinical disease and enhances eradication of the causative organism from the conjunctiva.<doc-sep>Antibacterial effectiveness of ciprofloxacin 0.3% ophthalmic solution in the treatment of bacterial conjunctivitis.<doc-sep>Two hundred eighty-eight cases of culture-proven bacterial conjunctivities were evaluated as part of two multicentered, randomized, prospective clinical studies comparing the antibacterial efficacy of topically administered ciprofloxacin 0.3% either with a placebo or with tobramycin 0.3%. In the first study, ciprofloxacin was significantly (P less than .001) more effective than the placebo. It eradicated or reduced the various bacterial pathogens in 93.6% of patients, compared to 59.5% for the placebo. In the second study, ciprofloxacin (94.5%) and tobramycin (91.9%) were equally effective. Topically applied ciprofloxacin eradicated or reduced all isolated bacterial species, attesting to its broad antibacterial spectrum and its potential usefulness in treating external ocular infections.<doc-sep>Chloramphenicol treatment for acute infective conjunctivitis in children in primary care: a randomised double-blind placebo-controlled trial.<doc-sep>One in eight schoolchildren have an episode of acute infective conjunctivitis every year.

We undertook a randomised double-blind trial to compare the effectiveness of chloramphenicol eye drops with placebo in children with infective conjunctivitis in primary care.\n                Our study included 326 children aged 6 months to 12 years with a clinical diagnosis of conjunctivitis who were recruited from 12 general medical practices in the UK. We assigned 163 children to receive chloramphenicol eye drops and 163 to receive placebo eye drops. Eye swabs were taken for bacterial and viral analysis. The primary outcome was clinical cure at day 7, which was assessed from diaries completed by parents. All children were followed up for 6 weeks to identify relapse. Survival statistics were used for comparison, and analysis was by intention to treat.\n                Nine children were lost to follow-up (one in chloramphenicol group; eight in placebo group). Clinical cure by day 7 occurred in 128 (83%) of 155 children with placebo compared with 140 (86%) of 162 with chloramphenicol (risk difference 3.8%, 95% CI -4.1% to 11.8%). Seven (4%) children with chloramphenicol and five (3%) with placebo had further conjunctivitis episodes within 6 weeks (1.2%, -2.9% to 5.3%). Adverse events were rare and evenly distributed between each group.\n                Most children presenting with acute infective conjunctivitis in primary care will get better by themselves and do not need treatment with an antibiotic.<doc-sep>Efficacy and tolerability of besifloxacin ophthalmic suspension 0.6% administered twice daily for 3 days in the treatment of bacterial conjunctivitis: a multicenter, randomized, double-masked, vehicle-controlled, parallel-group study in adults and children.<doc-sep>Besifloxacin is a topical fluoroquinolone with potent in vitro activity against a broad spectrum of ocular pathogens, including drug-resistant strains. Besifloxacin ophthalmic suspension 0.6% given 3 times daily for 5 days has been reported to be more effective than its vehicle in the treatment of bacterial conjunctivitis. Pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic modeling suggests that besifloxacin might also be effective given twice daily.\n                This study evaluated the efficacy and tolerability of besifloxacin ophthalmic suspension 0.6% administered twice daily for 3 days compared with vehicle (formulation without besifloxacin) in the treatment of adults and children with bacterial conjunctivitis.\n                This was a multicenter, prospective, randomized, double-masked, vehicle-controlled, parallel-group study. Patients aged ≥1 year with bacterial conjunctivitis were randomized to receive besifloxacin ophthalmic suspension or vehicle administered twice daily for 3 days. There were 3 study visits: the baseline visit, visit 2 (day 4 or 5), and visit 3 (day 7±1). Participants recorded the times of medication instillation in a patient diary. The primary end points were clinical resolution and bacterial eradication of the baseline bacterial infection at visit 2 in patients with culture-confirmed bacterial conjunctivitis. Secondary end points were clinical resolution and bacterial eradication of the baseline bacterial infection at visit 3, individual clinical outcomes (ocular conjunctival discharge and bulbar conjunctival injection) at the follow-up visits, and microbial and clinical outcomes for overall bacterial species and individual gram-positive and gram-negative bacterial species. Tolerability assessments included ocular adverse events (AEs), changes in visual acuity, biomicroscopy and ophthalmoscopy findings, and nonocular AEs.\n                Of 202 patients randomized to treatment (mean [SD] age, 25.2 [24.3] years; 56.9% female; 76.7% white), 109 had culture-confirmed bacterial conjunctivitis (53 besifloxacin ophthalmic suspension, 56 vehicle). At visit 2, the besifloxacin ophthalmic suspension group had significantly greater rates of clinical resolution compared with the vehicle group (37/53 [69.8%] vs 21/56 [37.5%], respectively; P < 0.001), as well as significantly greater rates of bacterial eradication (46/53 [86.8%] vs 32/56 [57.1%]; P < 0.001). At visit 3, rates of bacterial eradication were also significantly greater in the besifloxacin ophthalmic suspension group compared with the vehicle group (46/53 [86.8%] vs 39/56 [69.6%]; P = 0.038). Results for the individual clinical outcomes and microbial and clinical outcomes by gram-positive and gram-negative species were consistent with the primary efficacy outcomes. The incidence of ocular AEs did not differ significantly between treatment groups (4/94 [4.3%] vs 8/98 [8.2%]). Ocular AEs in all treated eyes in the respective groups included bacterial conjunctivitis (3/157 [1.9%] and 5/154 [3.2%]), conjunctivitis (3/157 [1.9%] and 4/154 [2.6%]), and allergic conjunctivitis (2/157 [1.3%] and 1/154 [0.6%]). These events were of mild or moderate severity. Changes in visual acuity and biomicroscopy and ophthalmoscopy findings were comparable between groups. There were few nonocular AEs (2/94 [2.1%] vs 3/98 [3.1%]; P = NS), none of them considered treatment related.\n                In these adults and children with bacterial conjunctivitis, treatment with besifloxacin ophthalmic suspension 0.6% administered twice daily for 3 days was effective and well tolerated.

Patients received either topical besifloxacin ophthalmic suspension or vehicle administered 3 times daily for 5 days. At study entry and on days 4 and 8 (visits 2 and 3), a clinical assessment of ocular signs and symptoms was performed in both eyes, as well as pinhole visual acuity testing, biomicroscopy, and culture of the infected eye(s). An ophthalmoscopic examination was performed at study entry and on day 8. The primary efficacy outcome measures were clinical resolution and eradication of the baseline bacterial infection on day 8 in culture-confirmed patients.

The culture-confirmed intent-to-treat population consisted of 118 patients (60 besifloxacin ophthalmic suspension, 58 vehicle). Significantly more patients receiving besifloxacin ophthalmic suspension than vehicle had clinical resolution of the baseline infection at visit 3 (44/60 [73.3%] vs 25/58 [43.1%], respectively; P < 0.001). Rates of bacterial eradication also were significantly greater with besifloxacin ophthalmic suspension compared with vehicle at visit 3 (53/60 [88.3%] vs35/58 [60.3%]; P < 0.001). The cumulative frequency of adverse events did not differ significantly between the 2 groups (69/137 [50.4%] and 70/132 [53.0%]). The most common ocular adverse events were eye pain (20/190 treated eyes [10.5%] and 13/188 [6.9%]), blurred vision (20/190 [10.5%] and 22/188 [11.7%]), and eye irritation (14/190 [7.4%] and 23/188 [12.2%]); these events were of mild or moderate severity.

Biennial screening (i.e., every 2 years) resulted in only a 6% mortality reduction. Two European trials (in England and in Denmark) subsequently showed statistically significant 15% and 18% mortality reductions with biennial screening. Herein, we provide updated results-through 18 years of follow-up--from the Minnesota trial that address the apparent inconsistent findings among the trials regarding biennial screening.\n                From 1976 through 1977, a total of 46551 study subjects, aged 50-80 years, were recruited and randomly assigned to an annual screen, a biennial screen, or a control group. A screen consisted of six guaiac-impregnated fecal occult blood tests (Hemoccult) prepared in pairs from each of three consecutive fecal samples. Participants with at least one of the six tests that were positive were invited for a diagnostic examination that included colonoscopy. All participants were followed annually to ascertain incident colorectal cancers and deaths.\n                The numbers of deaths from all causes were similar among the three study groups. Cumulative 18-year colorectal cancer mortality was 33% lower in the annual group than in the control group (rate ratio, 0.67; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.51-0.83). The biennial group had a 21% lower colorectal cancer mortality rate than the control group (rate ratio, 0.79; 95% CI = 0.62-0.97). A marked reduction was also noted in the incidence of Dukes' stage D cancers in both screened groups in comparison with the control group.\n                The results from this study, together with the other two published randomized trials of fecal occult blood screening, are consistent in demonstrating a substantial, statistically significant reduction in colorectal cancer mortality from biennial screening.<doc-sep>Results of screening, rescreening, and follow-up in a prospective randomized study for detection of colorectal cancer by fecal occult blood testing. Results for 68,308 subjects.<doc-sep>All 68,308 inhabitants of Göteborg born between 1918 and 1931 were randomly divided into a test and a control group. The subjects in the test group were invited to perform Hemoccult II fecal occult blood testing on 3 days and to repeat the test after 16 to 24 months. In the prevalence screening 21,347 (63%) performed the test, and in the rescreening 19,991 (60%). Investigation of the 942 (4.4%) with positive tests in the prevalence screening showed 47 cancers and 129 subjects with adenomas > or = 1.0 cm. In the rescreening 5.1% had a positive test, and 34 cancers and 122 subjects with adenomas (> or = 1.0 cm) were found among those. Cancer had also been diagnosed in 19 subjects in the interval between the two screening occasions and in 15 subjects among the non-responders. Forty-four cancers had been diagnosed in the control group during the same period. Cancers detected by screening were at a less advanced stage than in the control group. It is too early to show any effect of screening on mortality from colorectal cancer.<doc-sep>Reducing mortality from colorectal cancer by screening for fecal occult blood. Minnesota Colon Cancer Control Study.<doc-sep>Although tests for occult blood in the feces are widely used to screen for colorectal cancers, there is no conclusive evidence that they reduce mortality from this cause. We evaluated a fecal occult-blood test in a randomized trial and documented its effectiveness.\n                We randomly assigned 46,551 participants 50 to 80 years of age to screening for colorectal cancer once a year, to screening every two years, or to a control group. Participants who were screened submitted six guaiac-impregnated paper slides with two smears from each of three consecutive stools. About 83 percent of the slides were rehydrated. Participants who tested positive underwent a diagnostic evaluation that included colonoscopy. Vital status was ascertained for all study participants during 13 years of follow-up. A committee determined causes of death. A single pathologist determined the stage of each tissue specimen. Differences in mortality from colorectal cancer, the primary study end point, were monitored with the sequential log-rank statistic.\n                The 13-year cumulative mortality per 1000 from colorectal cancer was 5.88 in the annually screened group (95 percent confidence interval, 4.61 to 7.15), 8.33 in the biennially screened group (95 percent confidence interval, 6.82 to 9.84), and 8.83 in the control group (95 percent confidence interval, 7.26 to 10.40). The rate in the annually screened group, but not in the biennially screened group, was significantly lower than that in the control group. Reduced mortality in the annually screened group was accompanied by improved survival in those with colorectal cancer and a shift to detection at an earlier stage of cancer.\n                Annual fecal occult-blood testing with rehydration of the samples decreased the 13-year cumulative mortality from colorectal cancer by 33 percent.<doc-sep>Effect of faecal occult blood screening on mortality from colorectal cancer: results from a randomised controlled trial.<doc-sep>Three large randomised trials have shown that screening for colorectal cancer using faecal occult blood (FOB) tests can reduce the mortality from this disease. Two national pilot studies have recently been launched in the UK to investigate the feasibility of population screening for colorectal cancer in the National Health Service. The largest of the randomised trials was conducted in Nottingham and randomised 152 850 individuals between the ages of 45 and 74 years to receive biennial Haemoccult (FOB) test kit (intervention group) or to a control group.\n                We have compared the mortality in the intervention group compared with the control group.\n                The 152 850 randomised individuals were followed up through local health records and central flagging (Office for National Statistics) over a median follow up period of 11 years.\n                At a median follow up of 11 years there was a 13% reduction in colorectal cancer mortality (95% confidence interval 3-22%) in the intervention group despite an uptake at first invitation of only approximately 50%. The mortality reduction for those accepting screening was 27%. The reduction in mortality was independent of sex and site of tumour. There was no significant difference in mortality from causes other than colorectal cancer between the intervention and control groups.\n                Although the reduction in colorectal cancer mortality was sustained, further follow up of this population is required to determine whether a significant reduction in the incidence of colorectal cancer will be achieved.<doc-sep>The risks of screening: data from the Nottingham randomised controlled trial of faecal occult blood screening for colorectal cancer.<doc-sep>To determine the harm that ensues from faecal occult blood (FOB) screening for colorectal cancer.\n                150 251 people were randomly allocated either to receive biennial Haemoccult FOB tests (n =75 253) or not to be contacted (n=74 998). Study group patients returning positive tests were offered colonic investigation; 1774 underwent complete investigation of the colon.\n                There was no significant difference in the stage at presentation of interval versus control group cancers. Survival in the interval cancer group was significantly prolonged compared with the control group. Sensitivity for colonoscopy or flexible sigmoidoscopy and double contrast barium enema (DCBE) was 96.7%. There were no complications of DCBE but seven (0.5%) complications of colonoscopy, of which six required surgical intervention. There were no colonoscopy related deaths. No patients without colorectal cancer died within 30 days of colonic investigation. Five patients died within 30 days of surgery for screen detected colorectal neoplasia and a further two died without having surgery. Six patients died after 30 days but within two years of surgery for screen detected benign adenomas or stage A cancers; in all cases the cause of death was not related to colorectal cancer.\n                There was investigation related morbidity but no mortality and little to support overdiagnosis bias. The group returning falsely negative tests had a better outcome compared with the whole control group. There is a negative side to any screening programme but mortality reduction in this and other trials suggests that a national programme of colorectal cancer screening should be given consideration.<doc-sep>A randomised study of screening for colorectal cancer using faecal occult blood testing: results after 13 years and seven biennial screening rounds.<doc-sep>Three randomised trials have demonstrated reduction in mortality from colorectal cancer (CRC) by repeated screening with faecal occult blood tests, including the trial presented here, which is the only one still in progress.\n                To evaluate reduction in mortality after seven screening rounds and the possible influence of compliance on mortality from CRC.\n                At Funen in Denmark, random allocation to biennial screening with Hemoccult-II in 30 967 subjects aged 45-75 years and 30,966 controls was performed in 1985 from a population of 137,485 of the same age. Only participants who completed the first screening round were invited for further screening. Colonoscopy was offered if the test was positive. The primary end point was death from CRC, and the 10 year results were published in 1996.\n                From the beginning of the first screening to the seventh round, mean age increased from 59.8 to 70.0 years in the screening and control groups, and the male/female ratio decreased from 0.92 to 0.81. Those who accepted screening were younger than non-responders. Positivity rates varied from 0.8% to 3.8%, the cumulative ratio of a positive test was 5.1% after seven rounds, and 4.8% of patients had at least one colonoscopy. Mortality from CRC was significantly less in the screening group (relative risk (RR) 0.82 (0.69-0.97)), and the reduction in mortality was most pronounced above the sigmoid colon. After seven rounds, RR was reduced to less than 0.70 compared with controls. Mortality rates from causes other than CRC did not differ. Non-responders had a significantly increased risk of death from CRC compared with those who accepted the full programme. Subjects who accepted the first screening, but not subsequent ones, demonstrated a tendency towards increased risk.\n                The persistent reduction in mortality from CRC in a biennial screening program with Hemoccult-II, and a reduction in RR to less than 0.70 in those adhering to the programme, support attempts to introduce larger scale population screening programmes. The smaller effect on mortality from CRC in the rectum and sigmoid colon suggests evaluation by additional flexible sigmoidoscopy with longer intervals.<doc-sep>Randomized study of biennial screening with a faecal occult blood test: results after nine screening rounds.<doc-sep>Two large true population studies in Europe have shown a significant reduction in mortality from colorectal cancer (CRC) by screening with a faecal occult blood test. In one trial conducted in Funen County, 61,933 individuals (aged 45-75 years) were randomly allocated either to a control group or to receive a biennial Hemoccult-II test.\n                These individuals were followed from 1985 to 2002 and 9 screening rounds were performed.\n                First screening was accepted by 67% (20,672). Positivity rates varied between 0.8% and 3.8%, and the cumulative proportion of the test group having colonoscopy was 5.3%. Screen-detected CRC was early (Dukes' A) in 36% compared to 11% among controls. Incidence of CRC was unchanged, but mortality was reduced by 11%. This figure increased to 43% in persons participating in all 9 rounds. No more than 8,558 were screened at the 9th round. Patients with CRC detected between screenings had better survival than controls. Death rates from causes other than CRC among participants never became higher than among controls.\n                The lesser reduction in mortality from CRC of 11% compared to 18% after 5 screening rounds may be explained by the decrease in the number screened. Efficacy in those screened supports the introduction of countrywide screening in Denmark, but it must be ascertained that acceptability, proportion of early CRC and logistics all reach the same standard as in the randomized trial.<doc-sep>",
         "Benefits of screening include a modest reduction in colorectal cancer mortality, a possible reduction in cancer incidence through the detection and removal of colorectal adenomas, and potentially, the less invasive surgery that earlier treatment of colorectal cancers may involve.Harmful effects of screening include the psycho-social consequences of receiving a false-positive result, the potentially significant complications of colonoscopy or a false-negative result, the possibility of overdiagnosis (leading to unnecessary investigations or treatment) and the complications associated with treatment.",

We report the results of an RCT conducted in New York City in which 180 LGBM were assigned either to an intervention developed specifically for this population or to a wait-list control group. The intervention was based on empowerment theory and used factors identified in prior research as determinants of unsafe sex. By eligibility criteria, all men had engaged in unprotected anal intercourse (UAI) within two months of the baseline assessment. At first (two months) and second (six months later) follow-up assessments, approximately half of the men in the experimental group reported no UAI. Yet, a similar proportion of the control group also reported no UAI. Baseline data indicate that although the men had been the subject of social oppression and sexual prejudice (homophobia), they did not feel disempowered, externally controlled or fatalistic, and they reported self-efficacy and intentionality to enact safer sex. Lessons learned are discussed, as well as notes of caution for future research employing a similar conceptual framework.<doc-sep>Behavioral treatment approaches for methamphetamine dependence and HIV-related sexual risk behaviors among urban gay and bisexual men.<doc-sep>Methamphetamine-dependent gay and bisexual men (GBM) are at high risk for HIV transmission, largely due to drug-associated sexual risk behaviors. This project evaluated the efficacy of four behavioral drug abuse treatments for reducing methamphetamine use and sexual risk behaviors among this population.\n                In this randomized controlled trial, 162 methamphetamine-dependent (SCID-verified) GBM in Los Angeles County were randomly assigned to one of four treatment conditions for 16 weeks: standard cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT, n=40), contingency management (CM, n=42), combined cognitive behavioral therapy and contingency management (CBT+CM, n=40), and a culturally tailored cognitive behavioral therapy (GCBT, n=40). Stimulant use was assessed thrice-weekly during treatment using urine drug screens (48 measures). Sexual risk behaviors were monitored monthly (four measures). Follow-up assessments were conducted at 6 (80.0%) and 12 months (79.9%).\n                Statistically significant differences in retention (F(3,158)=3.78, p<.02), in longest period of consecutive urine samples negative for methamphetamine metabolites (F(3,158)=11.80, p<.001), and in the Treatment Effectiveness Score were observed by condition during treatment (F(3,158)=7.35, p<.001) with post hoc analyses showing the CM and CBT+CM conditions to perform better than standard CBT. GEE modeling results showed GCBT significantly reduced unprotected receptive anal intercourse (URAI) during the first 4 weeks of treatment (X2=6.75, p<.01). During treatment between-group differences disappeared at follow-up with overall reductions in outcomes sustained to 1-year.\n                Among high-risk methamphetamine-dependent GBM, drug abuse treatments produced significant reductions in methamphetamine use and sexual risk behaviors. Drug abuse treatments merit consideration as a primary HIV prevention strategy for this population.<doc-sep>Changing sexual behavior among gay male repeat testers for HIV: a randomized, controlled trial of a single-session intervention.<doc-sep>High-risk sexual behavior is increasingly prevalent among men who have sex with men (MSM) and among men with a history of repeat testing for HIV.\n                The study assessed whether one counseling intervention session focusing on self-justifications (thoughts, attitudes, or beliefs that allow the participant to engage in high-risk sexual behaviors) at most recent unprotected anal intercourse (UAI) is effective in reducing future high-risk behaviors among HIV-negative men.\n                A randomized, controlled, counseling intervention trial was conducted at an anonymous testing site in San Francisco, California, between May 1997 and January 2000. Participants were 248 MSM with a history of at least one previous negative HIV test result and self-reported UAI (receptive or insertive) in the previous 12 months with partners of unknown or discordant HIV status. Two intervention groups received standard HIV test counseling plus a cognitive-behavioral intervention, and two control groups received only standard HIV test counseling. Follow-up evaluation was at 6 and 12 months.\n                Number of episodes of UAI with nonprimary partners (of unknown or discordant HIV status) in the 90 days preceding the interview was measured via self-report during face-to-face interview.\n                A novel counseling intervention focusing on self-justifications significantly decreased the proportion of participants reporting UAI with nonprimary partners of unknown or discordant HIV status at 6 and 12 months (from 66% to 21% at 6 months and to 26% at 12 months, p =.002; p <.001) as compared with a control group when added to standard client-centered HIV counseling and testing.\n                A specific, single-session counseling intervention focusing on a reevaluation of a person's self-justifications operant during a recent occasion of high-risk behavior may prove useful in decreasing individual risk behavior and thus limiting community-level HIV transmission.<doc-sep>Examining self-justifications for unsafe sex as a technique of AIDS education: the importance of personal relevance.<doc-sep>In an earlier study, we found that sexual risk-taking in gay men was reduced by getting them to evaluate the self-justifications for having unsafe sex which they had used on a specific occasion when they 'slipped up' (broke their safe sex rules by having unprotected anal intercourse). This study investigated whether the earlier finding occurred simply because recalling vividly a specific encounter in which a slip-up took place brought the men's risk-taking home to them very strongly and whether the intervention would still work if translated into posters suitable for the mass media. Gay men (n=92) who had slipped up kept diaries of their sexual behaviour for 16 weeks. After 4 weeks, they were allocated to one of 3 conditions: Specific Encounter (detailed reconstruction of a slip-up, but without any questions about self-justifications); Posters (examination of posters, specially designed for the study, that focused on self-justifications); and Control (no intervention). All 3 groups slipped up to the same extent in the post-intervention period. The results for the Specific Encounter group indicate that the earlier finding is not attributable to the alternative explanation above, while those for the Posters group suggest the importance of ensuring personal 'ownership' of the self-justifications presented. Implications for AIDS education are discussed.<doc-sep>Preventing unprotected anal intercourse in gay men: a comparison of two intervention techniques.<doc-sep>This study compared the effectiveness of getting gay men to evaluate the self-justifications they use when breaking their safe sex rules to that of a standard approach to AIDS education. Men (n = 109) who had 'slipped up' (broken their safe sex rules by having unprotected anal intercourse) kept diaries of their sexual behaviour for 16 weeks. After 4 weeks they were allocated to one of 3 conditions, 2 involving brief interventions--Self-justifications (evaluation of self-justifications) and Standard (examination of posters used in AIDS education)--and a Control (diary only). At the time of the intervention, more members of the Self-justifications than the Standard group thought that it would help them not to slip up. In the post-intervention period, the 3 groups did not differ in the incidence of sexual activity or in the proportion who slipped up at least once, but the Self-justifications group were less likely to have had multiple slip-ups. Three possible explanations are offered for the effectiveness of the Self-justifications intervention. This approach may provide a useful alternative to standard techniques of AIDS education.<doc-sep>Brief cognitive counseling with HIV testing to reduce sexual risk among men who have sex with men: results from a randomized controlled trial using paraprofessional counselors.<doc-sep>To test the efficacy and acceptability of a single-session personalized cognitive counseling (PCC) intervention delivered by paraprofessionals during HIV voluntary counseling and testing.\n                HIV-negative men who have sex with men (MSM; n = 336) were randomly allocated to PCC or usual counseling (UC) between October 2002 and September 2004. The primary outcome was the number of episodes of unprotected anal intercourse (UAI) with any nonprimary partner of nonconcordant HIV serostatus in the preceding 90 days, measured at baseline, 6 months, and 12 months. Impact was assessed as \"intent to treat\" by random-intercept Poisson regression analysis. Acceptability was assessed by a standardized client satisfaction survey.\n                Men receiving PCC and UC reported comparable levels of HIV nonconcordant UAI at baseline (mean episodes: 4.2 vs. 4.8, respectively; P = 0.151). UAI decreased by more than 60% to 1.9 episodes at 6 months in the PCC arm (P < 0.001 vs. baseline) but was unchanged at 4.3 episodes for the UC arm (P = 0.069 vs. baseline). At 6 months, men receiving PCC reported significantly less risk than those receiving UC (P = 0.029 for difference to PCC). Risk reduction in the PCC arm was sustained from 6 to 12 months at 1.9 (P = 0.181), whereas risk significantly decreased in the UC arm to 2.2 during this interval (P < 0.001 vs. 6 months; P = 0.756 vs. PCC at 12 months). Significantly more PCC participants were \"very satisfied\" with the counseling experience (78.2%) versus UC participants (59.2%) (P = 0.002).\n                Both interventions were effective in reducing high-risk sexual behavior among MSM repeat testers. PCC participants demonstrated significant behavioral change more swiftly and reported a more satisfying counseling experience than UC participants.<doc-sep>An individually tailored intervention for HIV prevention: baseline data from the EXPLORE Study.<doc-sep>We describe the intervention tested in EXPLORE, an HIV prevention trial aimed at men who have sex with men (MSM), and test the empirical basis of the individually tailored intervention.\n                Data on participants' self-efficacy, communication skills, social norms, and enjoyment of unprotected anal intercourse were examined in relation to sexual risk. Combinations of these factors, together with alcohol use and noninjection drug use, were also examined.\n                The individual factors examined were associated with sexual risk behavior. The cohort was shown to be heterogeneous in regard to the presence of combinations of these risk-related factors.\n                Baseline data from the EXPLORE study support the efficacy of the individually tailored intervention used.<doc-sep>Effect of brief safer-sex counseling by medical providers to HIV-1 seropositive patients: a multi-clinic assessment.<doc-sep>To test the efficacy of brief, safer-sex counseling by medical providers of HIV-positive patients during medical visits.\n                Six HIV clinics in California.\n                Clinics were randomized to intervention arms evaluated with cohorts of randomly selected patients measured before and after the intervention.\n                Five-hundred and eighty-five HIV-positive persons, sexually active prior to enrollment.\n                Prevention counseling from medical providers supplemented with written information. Two clinics used a gain-framed approach (positive consequences of safer-sex), two used a loss-frame approach (negative consequences of unsafe sex), and two were attention-control clinics (medication adherence). Interventions were given to all patients who attended the clinics.\n                Self-reported unprotected anal or vaginal intercourse (UAV).\n                Among participants who had two or more sex partners at baseline, UAV was reduced 38% (P < 0.001) among those who received the loss-frame intervention. UAV at follow-up was significantly lower in the loss-frame arm [odds ratio (OR), 0.42; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.19-0.91; P = 0.03] compared with the control arm. Using generalized estimating equations (GEE) to adjust for clustering did not change the conclusions (OR, 0.34; 95% CI, 0.24-0.49; P = 0.0001). Similar results were obtained in participants with casual partners at baseline. No effects were seen in participants with only one partner or only a main partner at baseline. No significant changes were seen in the gain-frame arm.\n                Brief provider counseling emphasizing the negative consequences of unsafe sex can reduce HIV transmission behaviors in HIV-positive patients presenting with risky behavioral profiles.<doc-sep>Effectiveness of an intervention to reduce HIV transmission risks in HIV-positive people.<doc-sep>As many as one in three HIV-positive people continue unprotected sexual practices after learning that they are HIV infected. This article reports the outcomes of a theory-based intervention to reduce risk of HIV transmission for people living with HIV infection.\n                Men (n=233) and women (n=99) living with HIV-AIDS were randomly assigned to receive either (1) a five-session group intervention focused on strategies for practicing safer sexual behavior, or (2) a five-session, contact-matched, health-maintenance support group (standard-of-care comparison). Participants were followed for 6 months post-intervention.\n                The intervention to reduce risk of HIV transmission resulted in significantly less unprotected intercourse and greater condom use at follow-up. Transmission-risk behaviors with non-HIV-positive sexual partners and estimated HIV transmission rates over a 1-year horizon were also significantly lower for the behavioral risk-reduction intervention group.\n                This study is among the first to demonstrate successful HIV-transmission risk reduction resulting from a behavioral intervention tailored for HIV-positive men and women.<doc-sep>Looking for men in all the wrong places...: HIV prevention small-group programs do not reach high risk gay men.<doc-sep><doc-sep>Does bar-based, peer-led sexual health promotion have a community-level effect amongst gay men in Scotland?<doc-sep>This paper evaluates the effectiveness of a bar-based, peer-led community-level intervention to promote sexual health amongst gay men. The intervention consisted of peer education within bars, gay specific genitourinary medicine (GUM) services and a free-phone hotline. Data were collected at baseline (1996) and at follow-up (1999) in gay bars in Glasgow (intervention city) and Edinburgh (control city). During the intervention peer educators interacted with 1484 men and new clients increased at the gay specific GUM service. However, the hotline was under-utilized and abused. The outcome measures were: reported hepatitis B vaccination; HIV testing; unprotected anal intercourse (UAI) with casual partners; negotiated safety; and amongst men reporting UAI with a regular partner, the proportion who knew their own and their partner's HIV status. Significant differences in sexual health behaviours were observed across locations and across time, but the only significant intervention effects were amongst men who had direct contact with the intervention, with higher uptake of hepatitis B vaccination and HIV testing. The intervention did not produce community-wide changes in sexual health behaviours. These results question the replication and transferability of peer-led, community-level sexual health promotion for gay men outwith the USA and across time.<doc-sep>Evaluation of an HIV risk reduction intervention among African-American homosexual and bisexual men.<doc-sep>To provide the first data which evaluates an HIV risk reduction intervention designed to reduce HIV high-risk sexual behavior in African-American homosexual and bisexual men.\n                Participants (n = 318) were recruited from bars, bathhouses, and erotic bookstores, and through homosexual African-American organizations, street out-reach, media advertisements, and personal referrals of individuals aware of the study.\n                Participants were randomized into a single or triple session experimental group or a wait-list control group. Both experimental interventions included AIDS risk education, cognitive-behavioral self-management training, assertion training, and attempts to develop self-identity and social support. Data collection involved assessments of self-reported changes in sexual behavior at 12- and 18-month follow-up.\n                Participants in the triple session intervention greatly reduced their frequency of unprotected anal intercourse (from 46 to 20%) at the 12-month follow-up evaluation and (from 45% to 20%) at the 18-month follow-up evaluation. However, levels of risky behavior for the control group remained constant (from 26 to 23% and from 24 to 18%) at 12- and 18-month follow-up evaluations, respectively. In addition, levels of risky behavior for the single session intervention decreased only slightly (from 47 to 38% and from 50 to 38%) at the 12- and 18-month follow-up evaluations, respectively.\n                Results were interpreted to demonstrate the superiority of a triple session over a single session intervention in reducing risky sexual behavior in this cohort.<doc-sep>Effects of a behavioral intervention to reduce risk of transmission among people living with HIV: the healthy living project randomized controlled study.<doc-sep>The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) strongly recommend comprehensive risk counceling and services for people living with HIV (PLH); yet, there are no evidence-based counseling protocols.\n                To examine the effect of a 15-session, individually delivered, cognitive behavioral intervention on a diverse sample of PLH at risk of transmitting to others.\n                This was a multisite, 2-group, randomized, controlled trial.\n                Nine hundred thirty-six HIV-infected participants considered to be at risk of transmitting HIV of 3818 persons screened were randomized into the trial. Participants were recruited in Los Angeles, Milwaukee, New York, and San Francisco.\n                Fifteen 90-minute individually delivered intervention sessions were divided into 3 modules: stress, coping, and adjustment; safer behaviors; and health behaviors. The control group received no intervention until the trial was completed. Both groups completed follow-up assessments at 5, 10, 15, 20, and 25 months after randomization.\n                Transmission risk, as measured by the number of unprotected sexual risk acts with persons of HIV-negative or unknown status, was the main outcome measure.\n                Overall, a significance difference in mean transmission risk acts was shown between the intervention and control arms over 5 to 25 months (chi2 = 16.0, degrees of freedom = 5; P = 0.007). The greatest reduction occurred at the 20-month follow-up, with a 36% reduction in the intervention group compared with the control group.\n                Cognitive behavioral intervention programs can effectively reduce the potential of HIV transmission to others among PLH who report significant transmission risk behavior.<doc-sep>Prevention for substance-using HIV-positive young people: telephone and in-person delivery.<doc-sep>HIV risky behaviors and health practices were examined among young people living with HIV (YPLH) in Los Angeles, San Francisco, and New York over 15 months in response to receiving a preventive intervention. YPLH aged 16 to 29 years (n = 175; 26% black and 42% Latino; 69% gay men) were randomly assigned to a 3-module intervention totaling 18 sessions delivered by telephone, in person, or a delayed-intervention condition. Intention-to-treat analyses found that the in-person intervention resulted in a significantly higher proportion of sexual acts protected by condoms overall and with HIV-seronegative partners. Pre- and postanalyses of YPLH in the delayed-intervention condition alone found that YPLH tended to have fewer sexual partners, used fewer drugs, reported less emotional distress, and decreased their use of antiretroviral therapies. Prevention programs can be delivered in alternative formats while retaining efficacy. When YPLH are using hard drugs, drug treatment may be needed before delivery of preventive interventions.<doc-sep>An outcome evaluation to measure changes in sexual risk-taking among gay men undergoing substance use disorder treatment.<doc-sep>To evaluate the effects of safe sex intervention at a substance use disorder treatment agency designed to serve gay men.\n                Of all eligible men, 456 (78%) were recruited as they entered treatment for a substance use disorder. This cohort was followed for five waves of data collection, each wave measuring the previous 90 days. Assigned to the experimental condition (treatment for substance use disorder plus a safe sex intervention) were 82 men; 65 were assigned to the regular substance use disorder treatment.\n                Although levels of risk within each wave were never significantly different between the two treatment groups, reductions in unprotected anal intercourse (UAI) with a nonmonogamous partner for both groups from the baseline Wave-1 levels were uniformly significant (all p's < .05). Such high-risk sex in the year-long follow-up period was correlated with UAI reported at intake, enjoyment of UAI, relative youth, heavier concurrent use of alcohol or amphetamines and greater numbers of sexual partners.\n                We conclude that: (1) substantial HIV risk reductions can occur after initiation of treatment for substance use disorder among gay men; (2) risk reductions begin soon after treatment begins; (3) lapses to unsafe sex are common during treatment; (4) continued UAI is most likely among those men who are riskier at intake, who continue to be more sexually active and who are more likely to combine substance use and sexual behavior; (5) AIDS prevention activities conducted at treatment agencies cannot reach all high-risk substance-using gay men.<doc-sep>Reducing the sexual risk behaviors of HIV+ individuals: outcome of a randomized controlled trial.<doc-sep>Testing behavioral interventions to increase safer sex practices of HIV+ individuals has the potential to significantly reduce the number of new infections. This study evaluated a behavioral intervention designed to reduce the sexual risk behaviors of HIV+individuals. HIV+individuals (N = 387) who reported engaging in unprotected sex with HIV- or partners of unknown serostatus were randomly assigned to (a) a single counseling session targeting problem areas identified by the participant in 3 possible intervention domains (i.e., condom use, negotiation, disclosure); (b) a single-session comprehensive intervention that covered all 3 intervention domains; (c) the same comprehensive intervention, plus 2 monthly booster sessions; or (d) a 3-session diet and exercise attention-control condition. The median number of unprotected sex acts decreased from 14 at baseline to 6, 6, and 4 at 4-, 8-, and 12-month follow-ups, respectively. A repeated measures analysis of variance revealed a significant decrease in unprotected sex acts across all groups across time. A significant Group x Time interaction revealed that the comprehensive-with-boosters group had the most unprotected sex at 8-month follow-up as compared to the other 3 groups. These findings suggest that a brief intervention can result in large reductions in HIV transmission risks among HIV+individuals, but the relative benefit of one intervention approach over another remains unclear.<doc-sep>Effects of a peer-led behavioral intervention to reduce HIV transmission and promote serostatus disclosure among HIV-seropositive gay and bisexual men.<doc-sep>To evaluate the effects of an enhanced peer-led intervention on transmission risk behavior and serostatus disclosure of HIV-seropositive gay and bisexual men.\n                A randomized intervention trial.\n                HIV-seropositive gay and bisexual men were recruited from New York City and San Francisco and were randomly assigned to either a standard or an enhanced intervention. The standard intervention consisted of one session that provided safer sex information. The enhanced intervention consisted of six sessions and included safer sex information, interactive learning activities, and discussion groups that were facilitated by HIV-seropositive peers. Participants completed audio computer-assisted self interview (A-CASI) assessments at baseline and 3 and 6-month follow-ups. Optional testing for sexually transmitted infections was offered at baseline and the 6-month follow-up.\n                A total of 811 participants met the inclusion criteria for outcome analyses. Of these, 85 and 90% were retained for the 3 and 6-month follow-ups, respectively. Compared with the standard intervention, fewer men assigned to the enhanced intervention reported unprotected receptive anal intercourse with a negative or unknown-serostatus partner at 3 months (21 versus 26%, P < 0.05). However, there were no other significant differences in transmission risk or serostatus disclosure at 3 or 6 months.\n                The enhanced intervention was associated with only a limited reduction in transmission risk at 3 months relative to the standard intervention. The characteristics of the intervention that may have reduced its efficacy are identified and directions for future research are suggested.<doc-sep>Efficacy of a preventive intervention for youths living with HIV.<doc-sep>HIV transmission behaviors and health practices of HIV-infected youths were examined over a period of 15 months after they received a preventive intervention.\n                HIV-infected youths aged 13 to 24 years (n = 310; 27% African American, 37% Latino) were assigned by small cohort to (1) a 2-module (\"Stay Healthy\" and \"Act Safe\") intervention totaling 23 sessions or (2) a control condition. Among those in the intervention condition, 73% attended at least 1 session.\n                Subsequent to the \"Stay Healthy\" module, number of positive lifestyle changes and active coping styles increased more often among females who attended the intervention condition than among those in the control condition. Social support coping also increased significantly among males and females attending the intervention condition compared with those attending the control condition. Following the \"Act Safe\" module, youths who attended the intervention condition reported 82% fewer unprotected sexual acts, 45% fewer sexual partners, 50% fewer HIV-negative sexual partners, and 31% less substance use, on a weighted index, than those in the control condition.\n                Prevention programs can effectively reduce risk acts among HIV-infected youths. Alternative formats need to be identified for delivering interventions (e.g., telephone groups, individual sessions).<doc-sep>Randomised, controlled, community-level HIV-prevention intervention for sexual-risk behaviour among homosexual men in US cities. Community HIV Prevention Research Collaborative.<doc-sep>Community-level interventions may be helpful in population-focused HIV prevention. If members of populations at risk of HIV infection who are popular with other members can be engaged to advocate the benefits of behaviour change to peers, decreases in risk behaviour may be possible. We assessed a community-level intervention to lower the risk of HIV infection, focusing on men patronising gay bars in eight small US cities.\n                We used a randomised community-level field design. Four cities received the intervention and four control cities did not. Participants were men from each city who went to gay bars. Men completed surveys about their sexual behaviour on entering the bars during 3-night periods at baseline and at 1-year follow-up. In the control cities, HIV educational materials were placed in the bars. In the intervention cities, we recruited popular homosexual men in the community and trained them to spread behaviour-change endorsements and recommendations to their peers through conversation.\n                Population-level of risk behaviour decreased significantly in the intervention cities compared with the control cities at 1-year follow-up, after exclusion of surveys completed by transients and men with exclusive sexual partners in a city-level analysis, in the intervention cities we found a reduction in the mean frequency of unprotected anal intercourse during the previous 2 months (baseline 1.68 occasions; follow-up 0.59: p = 0.04) and an increase in the mean percentage of occasions of anal intercourse protected by condoms (baseline 44.7%; follow-up 66.8%, p = 0.02). Increased numbers of condoms taken from dispensers in intervention-city bars corroborated risk-behaviour self-reports.\n                Popular and well-liked members of a community who systematically endorse and recommend risk-reduction behaviour can influence the sexual-risk practices of others in their social networks. Natural styles of communication, such as conversations, brought about population-level changes in risk behaviour.<doc-sep>Community-level HIV intervention in 5 cities: final outcome data from the CDC AIDS Community Demonstration Projects.<doc-sep>This study evaluated a theory-based community-level intervention to promote progress toward consistent condom and bleach use among selected populations at increased risk for HIV infection in 5 US cities.\n                Role-model stories were distributed, along with condoms and bleach, by community members who encouraged behavior change among injection drug users, their female sex partners, sex workers, non-gay-identified men who have sex with men, high-risk youth, and residents in areas with high sexually transmitted disease rates. Over a 3-year period, cross-sectional interviews (n = 15,205) were conducted in 10 intervention and comparison community pairs. Outcomes were measured on a stage-of-change scale. Observed condom carrying and intervention exposure were also measured.\n                At the community level, movement toward consistent condom use with main (P < .05) and nonmain (P < .05) partners, as well as increased condom carrying (P < .0001), was greater in intervention than in comparison communities. At the individual level, respondents recently exposed to the intervention were more likely to carry condoms and to have higher stage-of-change scores for condom and bleach use.\n                The intervention led to significant communitywide progress toward consistent HIV risk reduction.<doc-sep>Outcomes and lessons from a pilot RCT of a community-based HIV prevention multi-session group intervention for gay men.<doc-sep>This paper presents the first outcome evaluation of multi-session groupwork for HIV prevention among gay men in the UK. This community-based RCT recruited 50 men, of whom 42% were HIV-positive or untested, and 32% reported status unknown or serodiscordant UAI in the previous 12 months. No knowledge, skills, attitudinal or behavioural differences were detected between intervention and control at baseline. At eight weeks, those attending the group reported significant gains over their control in making sexual choices, physical safety, HIV and STI transmission knowledge, and sexual negotiation skills. At 20 weeks, significant differences remained for HIV and STI transmission knowledge and comfort with sexual choices. Although no behavioural differences were detected, the aims of the National Prevention Strategy were met. This pilot RCT is appraised in the light of modest sample size and attrition, and recommendations for establishing behavioural outcomes are presented. This study has demonstrated that high-risk community samples can be recruited to multi-session interventions, and has provided feasibility data for future rigorous evaluation designs.<doc-sep>A randomized social network HIV prevention trial with young men who have sex with men in Russia and Bulgaria.<doc-sep>To evaluate the effects of an HIV prevention intervention with social networks of young men who have sex with men (YMSM) in St. Petersburg, Russia and Sofia, Bulgaria.\n                A two-arm randomized trial with a longitudinally-followed community cohort.\n                Fifty-two MSM social networks were recruited through access points in high-risk community venues. Network members (n = 276) were assessed to determine risk characteristics, administered sociometric measures to empirically identify the social leader of each network, and counseled in risk reduction. The leaders of 25 experimental condition networks attended a nine-session program that provided training and guidance in delivering ongoing theory-based HIV prevention advice to other network members. Leaders successively targeted network members' AIDS risk-related knowledge and risk reduction norms, attitudes, intentions, and self-efficacy. Participants were re-administered risk assessment measures at 3- and 12-month follow-ups.\n                Among changes produced, the percentage of experimental network members reporting unprotected intercourse (UI) declined from 71.8 to 48.4% at 3-month follow up (P = 0.0001). The percentage who engaged in UI with multiple partners reduced from 31.5 to 12.9% (P = 0.02). After 12 months, the effects became attenuated but remained among participants who had multiple recent sexual partners, the most vulnerable group. Little change was found in control group networks.\n                Interventions that engage the identified influence leaders of at-risk YMSM social networks to communicate theory-based counseling and advice can produce significant sexual risk behavior change. This model is culturally pertinent for HIV prevention efforts in former socialist countries, as well as elsewhere for other hard-to-reach vulnerable community populations.<doc-sep>HIV risk behavior reduction following intervention with key opinion leaders of population: an experimental analysis.<doc-sep>Peer norms influence the adoption of behavior changes to reduce risk for HIV (human immunodeficiency virus) infection. By experimentally intervening at a community level to modify risk behavior norms, it may be possible to promote generalized reductions in HIV risk practices within a population.\n                We trained persons reliably identified as popular opinion leaders among gay men in a small city to serve as behavior change endorsers to their peers. The opinion leaders acquired social skills for making these endorsements and complied in talking frequently with friends and acquaintances. Before and after intervention, we conducted surveys of men patronizing gay clubs in the intervention city and in two matched comparison cities.\n                In the intervention city, the proportion of men who engaged in any unprotected anal intercourse in a two-month period decreased from 36.9 percent to 27.5 percent (-25 percent from baseline), with a reduction from 27.1 percent to 19.0 percent (-30 percent from baseline) for unprotected receptive anal intercourse. Relative to baseline levels, there was a 16 percent increase in condom use during anal intercourse and an 18 percent decrease in the proportion of men with more than one sexual partner. Little or no change was observed among men in the comparison cities over the same period of time.\n                Interventions that employ peer leaders to endorse change may produce or accelerate population behavior changes to lessen risk for HIV infection.<doc-sep>A randomized trial of an education and support program for HIV-infected individuals.<doc-sep>To assess the effectiveness of an intervention for providing information and support to HIV-positive donors on changes in their sexual behavior, and to assess which donor characteristics are predictive of behavior change.\n                Subjects were randomly assigned to a structured intervention or community referral group. Follow-up assessments were conducted every 6 months.\n                New York City, New York, USA.\n                A cohort of 271 HIV-infected persons who donated blood to the New York Blood Center.\n                Donors randomized to the structured intervention program met individually with a nurse for counseling and were offered a six-session support group. The program was designed to provide information, encourage safer sexual behavior and provide support.\n                Sexual behavior, psychological distress and psychological help seeking, and immune function.\n                In both groups there was a large decrease over time in reports of unsafe sexual activity. However, more than 30% of participants in both groups reported unsafe sexual activity at the 1-year follow-up visit. Donors randomized to the structured intervention program did not report significantly more behavior change at the 1-year follow-up.\n                Better programs to promote behavior change in seropositive individuals are needed.<doc-sep>HIV prevention with male prostitutes and patrons of hustler bars: replication of an HIV preventive intervention.<doc-sep>The core objectives of this study were to document the process by which a community-based organization replicated and adapted an experimentally developed intervention to its own use and to explore the effectiveness of that HIV prevention program for male prostitutes and other patrons in New York City \"hustler\" bars. The intervention model employed was based on previous research with gay men (Kelly, St. Lawrence, Diaz, et al., 1991; Kelly, St. Lawrence, Stevenson, et al., 1992) and inspired by diffusion of innovation theory (Rogers, 1995). The effects of the current intervention were assessed on a sample of 1,741 male prostitutes and bar patrons. Analyses indicated significant reductions in paid, unprotected sexual intercourse and oral sex following the intervention. Analyses further indicated that the data were partially consistent with the program's model, which specified that norms were the putative mediator of behavior change in the intervention. Also, the intervention's effects varied by bar and by participants' race/ethnicity. Data support the utility of the intervention model for an urban sample of men at high risk for HIV infection. The importance of exploring the mechanisms that underlie the intervention is discussed.<doc-sep>Outcome of cognitive-behavioral and support group brief therapies for depressed, HIV-infected persons.<doc-sep>Although many studies have documented patterns of emotional distress in persons with HIV disease, there have been few controlled evaluations of therapy outcomes with these individuals. This research evaluated the effects of brief cognitive-behavioral or social support group therapy with this population.\n                Sixty-eight depressed men with HIV infection were randomly assigned to one of three conditions: eight-session cognitive-behavioral groups, eight-session social support groups, or a comparison condition. Before and after intervention and at 3-month follow-up, all participants were individually assessed by using measures of symptoms of distress as well as substance use and sexual practices.\n                Relative to the comparison group, both the cognitive-behavioral and social support group therapies produced reductions in depression, hostility, and somatization. The social support intervention also produced reductions in overall psychiatric symptoms and tended to reduce maladaptive interpersonal sensitivity, anxiety, and frequency of unprotected receptive anal intercourse, while the cognitive-behavioral intervention resulted in less frequent illicit drug use during the follow-up period. Tests for clinical significance of change particularly underscored benefits of the social support group intervention both at postintervention and at long-term follow-up.\n                Brief group therapy for depressed persons with HIV infection produced reductions in symptoms of distress. The two forms of therapy resulted in shared and unique improvements in functioning, although social support groups focused on emotional coping presented greater evidence of clinically significant change. As more persons contract HIV infection and live longer with HIV disease, further research is needed to evaluate outcomes of mental health services with these individuals.<doc-sep>A cognitive behavioural intervention to reduce sexually transmitted infections among gay men: randomised trial.<doc-sep>To determine the effectiveness of a brief cognitive behavioural intervention in reducing the incidence of sexually transmitted infections among gay men.\n                Randomised controlled trial with 12 months' follow up.\n                Sexual health clinic in London.\n                343 gay men with an acute sexually transmitted infection or who reported having had unprotected anal intercourse in the past year.\n                Number of new sexually transmitted infections diagnosed during follow up and self reported incidence of unprotected anal intercourse.\n                72% (361/499) of men invited to enter the study did so. 90% (308/343) of participants returned at least one follow up questionnaire or re-attended the clinic and requested a check up for sexually transmitted infections during follow up. At baseline, 37% (63/172) of the intervention group and 30% (50/166) of the control group reported having had unprotected anal intercourse in the past month. At 12 months, the proportions were 27% (31/114) and 32% ( 39/124) respectively (P=0.56). However, 31% (38/123) of the intervention group and 21% (35/168) of controls had had at least one new infection diagnosed at the clinic (adjusted odds ratio 1.66, 95% confidence interval 1.00 to 2.74). Considering only men who requested a check up for sexually transmitted infections, the proportion diagnosed with a new infection was 58% (53/91) for men in the intervention group and 43% (35/81) for men in the control group (adjusted odds ratio 1.84, 0.99 to 3.40). Using a regional database that includes information from 23 sexual health clinics in London, we determined that few participants had attended other sexual health clinics.\n                This behavioural intervention was acceptable and feasible to deliver, but it did not reduce the risk of acquiring a new sexually transmitted infection among these gay men at high risk. Even carefully designed interventions should not be assumed to bring benefit. It is important to evaluate their effects in randomised trials with objective clinical end points.<doc-sep>Stress reduction training changed number of sexual partners but not immune function in men with HIV.<doc-sep>We tested the impact of stress management training on sexual behavior and immune functioning in 64 gay men infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Subjects randomized to the stress management group met for eight two-hour sessions and one all day retreat to learn systematic relaxation, health behavior change, and stress management skills. Compared to those randomized to a wait list control, treatment subjects reported significantly fewer sexual partners in the prior month at post-test (1.10 vs 2.29 for controls). There were no differences between groups in lymphocyte numbers and function.<doc-sep>Case management for substance abusers with HIV/AIDS: a randomized clinical trial.<doc-sep>In a random assignment study, substance-abusing patients with HIV/AIDS in a public general hospital received a brief contact condition or received 12 months of case management delivered by paraprofessionals. Patient outcomes included substance use, HIV transmission risk, physical health, psychological status, and quality of living situation. In both conditions, a significant decrease occurred in a range of problems from Intake to the 6-month interview, followed by no significant pattern of change at 12- and 18-month interviews. On major outcome variables, there were no significant differences between the brief contact and case management conditions. Sixteen percent had died by the 18-month interview. Process data indicated wide variation in the amount of case management received by participants, and the amount of case management was not related to improvement in the outcome measures. The study has limitations yet does not support the hypothesis that case management improves outcomes better than brief contact for this population.<doc-sep>The efficacy of brief group counseling in HIV risk reduction among homosexual Asian and Pacific Islander men.<doc-sep>The incidence of AIDS is increasing at a higher rate among homosexual Asian and Pacific Islanders (API) than white homosexual men in the United States. The number of homosexual API men engaging in unsafe sex is increasing at an alarming rate. HIV risk reduction is urgently needed in this population.\n                We developed and evaluated culturally appropriate brief group counseling with 329 self-identified homosexual API recruited in San Francisco between 1992 and 1994. Participants were randomized into a single, 3-h skills training group or a wait-list control group. The intervention consisted of four components: (1) development of positive self-identity and social support, (2) safer sex education, (3) eroticizing safer sex, and (4) negotiating safer sex. Data were collected at baseline and 3 months after the intervention.\n                Significant reductions in number of sexual partners were observed among all treatment subjects, regardless of ethnicity (P = 0.003). Treatment decreased the number of partners reported at 3-month follow-up by 46% [95% confidence interval (CI), 28-77]. Chinese and Filipino men further benefited from the intervention: treatment subjects from these two ethnic groups reduced unprotected anal intercourse at follow-up by more than half when compared to their counterparts (odds ratio = 0.41; 95% CI, 0.19-0.89; P = 0.024).\n                We demonstrated the efficacy of brief group counseling in reducing HIV risk among homosexual API. Cities with significant API populations should adopt culturally tailored skills training as part of HIV prevention strategies for this group of homosexual men.<doc-sep>AIDS prevention in homosexual and bisexual men: results of a randomized trial evaluating two risk reduction interventions.<doc-sep>This study evaluates two AIDS risk-reduction interventions targeted at homosexual and bisexual men. Participants were randomized into two peer-led interventions: both involved a lecture on 'safer sex', and one provided a skills-training component during which men could discuss and rehearse the negotiation of safer sexual encounters. Follow-up data collection assessed self-reported changes in sexual behavior at 6 and 12 months. Skills training increased condom use for insertive anal intercourse. In sessions providing skills training, condom use increased, on average, by 44% between pre-test and second follow-up compared with only 11% on average in sessions which did not provide such training.<doc-sep>The Mpowerment Project: a community-level HIV prevention intervention for young gay men.<doc-sep>Since young gay men are engaging in alarmingly high rates of unsafe sex and few seek help for changing risky behaviors, community-level programs to prevent infection with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) among them are urgently needed.\n                We developed and implemented a community-level HIV prevention program in a midsized Oregon community. The peer-led program had three components: out-reach, small groups, and a publicity campaign. Independently from the prevention program, a cohort of young gay men (n = 300) was surveyed in this and in a similar comparison community pre- and postintervention.\n                Following intervention, the proportion of men engaging in any unprotected anal intercourse decreased from 41.0% to 30.0% (-27% from baseline), decreased from 20.2% to 11.1% (-45% from baseline) with nonprimary partners, and decreased from 58.9% to 44.7% (-24% from baseline) with boyfriends. No significant changes occurred in the comparison community over the same period.\n                This prevention approach effectively led to HIV risk reduction. To reach risk-taking young gay men, HIV prevention activities must be embedded in social activities and community life.<doc-sep>",
         "Behavioral interventions reduce self-reported unprotected anal sex among MSM. These results indicate that HIV prevention for this population can work and should be supported. \nResults of previous studies provide a benchmark for expectations in new studies. Meta-analysis can inform future design and implementation in terms of sample size, target populations, settings, goals for process measures, and intervention content.\nWhen effects differ by design variables, which are deliberately selected and planned, awareness of these characteristics may be beneficial to future designs. Researchers designing future small group and individual-level studies should keep in mind that to date, effects of the greatest magnitude have been observed in studies that used count outcomes and a shorter intervention span (up to 1 month).\nAmong small group and individual-level studies, effects were also greatest when the comparison condition included minimal to no HIV prevention content. Nevertheless, statistically significant favorable effects were also seen when the comparison condition included standard or other HIV prevention content. Researchers choosing the latter option for new studies should plan for larger sample sizes based on the smaller expected net intervention effect noted above.\nWhen effects differ by implementation variables, which become evident as the study is conducted but are not usually selected or planned, caution may be advised so that future studies can reduce bias. Because intervention effects were somewhat stronger (though not statistically significantly so) in studies with a greater attrition in the comparison condition, differential retention may be a threat to validity. Extra effort should be given to retaining participants in comparison conditions.\nAmong community-level interventions, intervention effects were strongest among studies with random assignment of groups or communities. Therefore the inclusion of studies where assignment of groups or communities was by convenience did not exaggerate the summary effect. The greater effectiveness of interventions including more than 25% non-gay identifying MSM suggests that when they can be reached, these men may be more responsive than gay-identified men to risk reduction efforts. Non-gay identified MSM may have had less exposure to previous prevention messages, so their initial exposure may have a greater impact.\nThe greater effectiveness of interventions that include efforts to promote personal skills such as keeping condoms available and behavioral self-management indicates that such content merits strong consideration in development and delivery of new interventions for MSM. And the finding that interventions were most effective for majority white populations underscores the critical need for effective interventions for MSM of African and Latino descent.\nFurther research measuring the incidence of HIV and other STDs is needed. Because most studies were conducted among mostly white men in the US and Europe, more evaluations of interventions are needed for African American and Hispanic MSM as well as MSM in the developing world. More research is also needed to further clarify which behavioral strategies (e.g., reducing unprotected anal sex, having oral sex instead of anal sex, reducing number of partners, avoiding serodiscordant partners, strategic positioning, or reducing anal sex even with condom use) are most effective in reducing transmission among MSM, the messages most effective in promoting these behaviors, and the methods and settings in which these messages can be most effectively delivered.",

         "Randomized, blind trial of dopamine versus dobutamine for treatment of hypotension in preterm infants with respiratory distress syndrome.<doc-sep>To compare the efficacy of dopamine and dobutamine for the treatment of hypotension (mean arterial blood pressure, < or = 30 mm Hg) in preterm (< or = 34 weeks of gestation) infants with respiratory distress syndrome in the first 24 hours of life, we enrolled 63 hypotensive preterm infants in a randomized, blind trial. Inclusion criteria required an arterial catheter for measurement of mean arterial blood pressure, treatment with exogenous surfactant, and persistent hypotension after volume expansion with 20 ml/kg (packed erythrocytes if hematocrit < 0.40, 5% albumin if > or = 0.40). Intravenous study drug infusions were initiated at 5 micrograms/kg per minute and then increased in increments of 5 micrograms/kg per minute at 20-minute intervals until a mean arterial blood pressure > 30 mm Hg was attained and sustained for > or = 30 minutes (success) or a maximum rate of 20 micrograms/kg per minute was reached without resolution of hypotension (failure). The study groups at entry were comparable for birth weight, gestational age, postnatal age, gender, birth depression, hematocrit < 0.40, heart rate, oxygenation index, delivery route, maternal chorioamnionitis, and maternal magnesium or ritodrine therapy. No infants in the dopamine group had a treatment failure (0/31; 0%); (16%) of 32 infants failed to respond to dobutamine (p = 0.028). Success was attained at < or = 10 micrograms/kg per minute in 30 (97%) of 31 infants given dopamine and in 22 (69%) of 32 infants given dobutamine (p < 0.01). Among those treated successfully, the increase in mean arterial blood pressure was significantly higher in those given dopamine (mean, 11.3 vs 6.8 mm Hg; p = 0.003). We conclude that dopamine is more effective than dobutamine for the early treatment of hypotension in preterm infants with respiratory distress syndrome.<doc-sep>Randomized trial comparing dopamine and dobutamine in preterm infants.<doc-sep>The aim of this study was to compare the efficacy of two inotropic infusions in treating low BP in preterm neonates. Forty infants with median gestational age 27 weeks (range 23-33) were studied. At trial entry the infants, who all had a systolic BP < 40 mmHg despite receiving a colloid infusion, were randomized to receive either a dopamine or dobutamine infusion. The infusions were commenced at a rate of 5 micrograms/kg per min and, if necessary, this was increased over the 3 h study period to 15 micrograms/kg per min. There was no significant difference in the gestational or postnatal age or baseline BP of the 20 infants who received dopamine and those 20 who received dobutamine. Three hours after commencing the infusions, although there was no difference in the rate of inotrope infusion between the two groups, the infants who received dopamine had a significantly higher systolic BP, a median of 39 mmHg (range 30-58) compared to a median of 34 mmHg (range 21-46) in the dobutamine group, P < 0.05. In addition, 10 infants who received dopamine, but only 3 who received dobutamine, had a systolic BP > 40 mmHg (P < 0.05). We conclude that dopamine rather than dobutamine infusion is more efficacious in improving the BP of preterm neonates.<doc-sep>Impact on blood pressure and intestinal perfusion of dobutamine or dopamine in hypotensive preterm infants.<doc-sep>In a prospective study hemodynamic effects of dobutamine or dopamine (10 micrograms/kg/min) were investigated in 20 preterm infants who had protracted arterial hypotension refractory to volume therapy. Doppler ultrasonography of the superior mesenteric artery (SMA) was applied to verify intestinal perfusion and blood pressure was recorded in parallel. Mean arterial pressure (MAP) raised significantly in both groups (from 31.0 +/- 6.8 to 37.7 +/- 9.8 mm Hg during dobutamine and from 27.7 +/- 3.6 to 36.0 +/- 9.3 mm Hg during dopamine). Mean blood flow velocity increased from 25.8 +/- 13.5 to 31.5 +/- 16 cm/s with dobutamine and from 16.3 +/- 5.0 to 19.0 +/- 6.0 cm/s with dopamine (significant for dobutamine). Vascular resistance of SMA (indicated by resistance index; RI) decreased from 0.81 +/- 0.07 to 0.74 +/- 0.11 for dobutamine and from 0.89 +/- 0.06 to 0.79 +/- 0.07 for dopamine (significant for both groups). These data indicate that in the dose tested here both catecholamines are equally effective in raising MAP and lead to a significant increase of intestinal perfusion. Thus, a negative impact on mesenteric blood supply, predisposing to necrotizing enterocolitis, is not probable.<doc-sep>Assessment of therapy for arterial hypotension in critically ill preterm infants.<doc-sep>The aim of this paper is to assess the efficacy of albumin and dopamine compared with albumin and dobutamine in treating hypotension in preterm newborn infants (PNI). A randomized, open-label, prospective, cross-over study, was designed on 66 PNI whose weights were between 1,000 to 1,500 g, and persistent hypotension, defined as a mean arterial pressure (MAP) of < 30 mmHg. Infants were randomly allocated to two groups and received a 5% albumin infusion at a dosage of 20 mL/kg, in 30 min. Thereafter, one group received dopamine and the other dobutamine at doses of 5 microg/kg/min. If there was not an increase in MAP values > 30 mmHg, the infusions were increased every 20 min by 2.5 microg/kg/min, up to a maximum of 10 microg/kg/min. Treatment failure was considered when there was no pressure response within 2 hr after the infusion started; then patients were changed to the other catecholamine. Statistical analysis was done with student's t-test, x2, and Fisher's exact probability test. There were no differences between groups in initial features. Overall, MAP was normalized with dopamine in 29 of 33 infants and with dobutamine in 25 of 33 infants (p > 0.05). The initial dosage of 5 microg/kg/min, was adequate in 22 infants treated with dopamine and in 13 treated with dobutamine (p < 0.05). The change from dopamine to dobutamine was successful in three out of four patients, while changing from dobutamine to dopamine was adequate in seven out of eight patients. Dopamine is recognized as the drug of choice to treat hypotension in PNI. Since our results showed only small differences in responses, it is proposed that dobutamine is also as efficacious and useful as dopamine.<doc-sep>Response to dobutamine and dopamine in the hypotensive very preterm infant.<doc-sep>A randomised double blind study was designed to evaluate haemodynamic response to dobutamine and dopamine in 20 hypotensive preterm infants of less than 32 weeks' gestation. Neonates initially received dopamine or dobutamine 5 micrograms/kg/min. If mean arterial pressure (MAP) remained below 31 mm Hg, the infusion rate was increased in increments of 5 micrograms/kg/min. If 20 micrograms/kg/min of the initial drug failed to achieve a MAP above 30 mm Hg, it was discontinued and the other drug was administered at the same infusion rate. Left ventricular output (LVO) was measured by pulsed Doppler echocardiography. Mean (SE) MAP increased significantly from 24.4 (1.0) to 32.0 (1.4) mm Hg at a median dobutamine dosage of 20 micrograms/kg/min and from 25.6 (1.2) to 37.7 (1.5) mm Hg at a median dopamine dosage of 12.5 micrograms/kg/min. The percentage LVO increase was +21 (7)% with dobutamine compared with -14 (8)% with dopamine. Dobutamine failed to increase MAP above 30 mm Hg in six infants out of 10, whereas dopamine succeeded in all 10 infants. Six switches from dobutamine to dopamine were thus performed, providing a rise in MAP (29.2 (0.5) to 41.2 (2.0) mm Hg) and drop in LVO (356 (40) to 263 (36) ml/kg/min). These data indicate that dopamine is more effective than dobutamine in raising and maintaining MAP above 30 mm Hg; however dopamine does not increase LVO.<doc-sep>",
         "Dopamine is more effective than dobutamine in the short term treatment of systemic hypotension in preterm infants. There was no evidence of an effect on the incidence of adverse neuroradiological sequelae (severe periventricular haemorrhage and/or periventricular leucomalacia), or on the incidence of tachycardia. However, in the absence of data confirming long term benefit and safety of dopamine compared to dobutamine, no firm recommendations can be made regarding the choice of drug to treat hypotension.",

         "Cooling for acute ischemic brain damage (cool aid): an open pilot study of induced hypothermia in acute ischemic stroke.<doc-sep>Hypothermia is effective in improving outcome in experimental models of brain infarction. We studied the feasibility and safety of hypothermia in patients with acute ischemic stroke treated with thrombolysis.\n                An open study design was used. All patients presented with major ischemic stroke (National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale [NIHSS] score >15) within 6 hours of onset. After informed consent, patients with a persistent NIHSS score of >8 were treated with hypothermia to 32+/-1 degrees C for 12 to 72 hours depending on vessel patency. All patients were monitored in the neurocritical care unit for complications. A modified Rankin Scale was measured at 90 days and compared with concurrent controls.\n                Ten patients with a mean age of 71.1+/-14.3 years and an NIHSS score of 19.8+/-3.3 were treated with hypothermia. Nine patients served as concurrent controls. The mean time from symptom onset to thrombolysis was 3.1+/-1.4 hours and from symptom onset to initiation of hypothermia was 6.2+/-1.3 hours. The mean duration of hypothermia was 47.4+/-20.4 hours. Target temperature was achieved in 3.5+/-1.5 hours. Noncritical complications in hypothermia patients included bradycardia (n=5), ventricular ectopy (n=3), hypotension (n=3), melena (n=2), fever after rewarming (n=3), and infections (n=4). Four patients with chronic atrial fibrillation developed rapid ventricular rate, which was noncritical in 2 and critical in 2 patients. Three patients had myocardial infarctions without sequelae. There were 3 deaths in patients undergoing hypothermia. The mean modified Rankin Scale score at 3 months in hypothermia patients was 3.1+/-2.3.\n                Induced hypothermia appears feasible and safe in patients with acute ischemic stroke even after thrombolysis. Refinements of the cooling process, optimal target temperature, duration of therapy, and, most important, clinical efficacy, require further study.<doc-sep>Feasibility and safety of inducing modest hypothermia in awake patients with acute stroke through surface cooling: A case-control study: the Copenhagen Stroke Study.<doc-sep>Hypothermia reduces neuronal damage in animal stroke models. Whether hypothermia is neuroprotective in patients with acute stroke remains to be clarified. In this case-control study, we evaluated the feasibility and safety of inducing modest hypothermia by a surface cooling method in awake patients with acute stroke.\n                We prospectively included 17 patients (cases) with stroke admitted within 12 hours from stoke onset (mean 3.25 hours). They were given hypothermic treatment for 6 hours by the \"forced air\" method, a surface cooling method that uses a cooling blanket with a flow of cool air (10 degrees C). Pethidine was given to treat compensatory shivering. Cases were compared with 56 patients (controls) from the Copenhagen Stroke Study matched for age, gender, initial stroke severity, body temperature on admission, and time from stroke onset to admission. Blood cytology, biochemistry, ECGs, and body temperature were monitored during hypothermic treatment. Multiple regression analyses on outcome were performed to examine the safety of hypothermic therapy.\n                Body temperature decreased from t(0)=36.8 degrees C to t(6)=35.5 degrees C (P:<0.001), and hypothermia was present until 4 hours after therapy (t(0)=36.8 degrees C versus t(10)=36.5 degrees C; P:=0.01). Mortality at 6 months after stroke was 12% in cases versus 23% in controls (P:=0. 50). Final neurological impairment (Scandinavian Stroke Scale score at 6 months) was mean 42.4 points in cases versus 47.9 in controls (P:=0.21). Hypothermic therapy was not a predictor of poor outcome in the multivariate analyses.\n                Modest hypothermia can be achieved in awake patients with acute stroke by surface cooling with the \"forced air\" method, in combination with pethidine to treat shivering. It was not associated with a poor outcome. We suggest a large, randomized clinical trial to test the possible beneficial effect of induced modest hypothermia in unselected patients with stroke.<doc-sep>Cooling for Acute Ischemic Brain Damage (COOL AID): a feasibility trial of endovascular cooling.<doc-sep>To report results of a randomized pilot clinical feasibility trial of endovascular cooling in patients with ischemic stroke.\n                Forty patients with ischemic stroke presenting within 12 hours of symptom onset were enrolled in the study. An endovascular cooling device was inserted into the inferior vena cava of those randomized to hypothermia. A core body temperature of 33 degrees C was targeted for 24 hours. All patients underwent clinical assessment and MRI initially, at days 3 to 5 and days 30 to 37.\n                Eighteen patients were randomized to hypothermia and 22 to receive standard medical management. Thirteen patients reached target temperature in a mean of 77 +/- 44 minutes. Most tolerated hypothermia well. Clinical outcomes were similar in both groups. Mean diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) lesion growth in the hypothermia group (n = 12) was 90.0 +/- 83.5% compared with 108.4 +/- 142.4% in the control group (n = 11) (NS). Mean DWI lesion growth in patients who cooled well (n = 8) was 72.9 +/- 95.2% (NS).\n                Induced moderate hypothermia is feasible using an endovascular cooling device in most patients with acute ischemic stroke. Further studies are needed to determine if hypothermia improves outcome.<doc-sep>Acetaminophen for altering body temperature in acute stroke: a randomized clinical trial.<doc-sep>Mild alterations in temperature have prominent effects on ischemic cell injury and stroke outcome. Elevated core body temperature (CBT), even if mild, may exacerbate neuronal injury and worsen outcome, whereas hypothermia is potentially neuroprotective. The antipyretic effects of acetaminophen were hypothesized to reduce CBT.\n                This was a randomized, controlled clinical trial at 2 university hospitals. Patients were included if they had stroke within 24 hours of onset of symptoms, National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score > or =5, initial CBT <3 8.5 degrees C, and white blood cell count < 12 600 cells/mm(3); they were excluded if they had signs of infection, severe medical illness, or contraindication to acetaminophen. CBT was measured every 30 minutes. Patients were randomized to receive acetaminophen 650 mg or placebo every 4 hours for 24 hours. The primary outcome measure was mean CBT during the 24-hour study period; the secondary outcome measure was the change in NIHSS.\n                Thirty-nine patients were randomized. Baseline CBT was the same: 36.96 degrees C for acetaminophen versus 36.95 degrees C for placebo (P=0.96). During the study period, CBT tended to be lower in the acetaminophen group (37.13 degrees C versus 37.35 degrees C), a difference of 0.22 degrees C (95% CI, -0.08 degrees C to 0.51 degrees C; P=0.14). Patients given acetaminophen tended to be more often hypothermic <36.5 degrees C (OR, 3.4; 95% CI, 0.83 to 14.2; P=0.09) and less often hyperthermic >37.5 degrees C (OR, 0.52; 95% CI, 0.19 to 1.44; P=0.22). The change in NIHSS scores from baseline to 48 hours did not differ between the groups (P=0.93).\n                Early administration of acetaminophen (3900 mg/d) to afebrile patients with acute stroke may result in a small reduction in CBT. Acetaminophen may also modestly promote hypothermia <36.5 degrees C or prevent hyperthermia >37.5 degrees C. These effects are unlikely to have robust clinical impact, and alternative or additional methods are needed to achieve effective thermoregulation in stroke patients.<doc-sep>Effect of paracetamol (acetaminophen) on body temperature in acute ischemic stroke: a double-blind, randomized phase II clinical trial.<doc-sep>Body temperature is a strong predictor of outcome in acute stroke. However, it is unknown whether antipyretic treatment leads to early and clinically worthwhile reduction of body temperature in patients with acute stroke, especially when they have no fever. The main purpose of this trial was to study whether early treatment of acute ischemic stroke patients with acetaminophen (paracetamol) reduces body temperature.\n                Seventy-five patients with acute ischemic stroke confined to the anterior circulation were randomized to treatment with either 500 mg (low dose) or 1000 mg (high dose) acetaminophen or with placebo, administered as suppositories 6 times daily during 5 days. Body temperatures were measured with a rectal electronic thermometer at the start of treatment and after 24 hours and with an infrared tympanic thermometer at 2-hour intervals during the first 24 hours and at 6-hour intervals thereafter. The primary outcome measure was rectal temperature at 24 hours after the start of treatment.\n                Treatment with high-dose acetaminophen resulted in 0.4 degrees C lower body temperatures than placebo treatment at 24 hours (95% CI 0.1 degrees C to 0.7 degrees C). The mean reduction from baseline temperature with high-dose acetaminophen was 0.3 degrees C (95% CI 0 degrees C to 0.6 degrees C) higher than that in placebo-treated patients. Treatment with low-dose acetaminophen did not result in lower body temperatures. After 5 days of treatment, no differences in temperature were found between the placebo and the high- or low-dose acetaminophen groups.\n                Treatment with a daily dose of 6000 mg acetaminophen may result in a small, but potentially beneficial, decrease in body temperature shortly after ischemic stroke, even in normothermic and subfebrile patients. Further studies should determine whether this effect is reproducible and whether early reduction of body temperature leads to improved outcome.<doc-sep>Prophylactic antipyretic treatment with acetaminophen in acute ischemic stroke: a pilot study.<doc-sep>Fever is associated with poor outcome in acute stroke. Forty-two consecutive, normothermic patients with acute ischemic stroke were, within 24 hours from symptom onset, randomized to either receive 4 g acetaminophen daily (n = 20) or matched placebo (n = 22). Fever of greater than 37.5 degrees C occurred in 36.4% of patients in the placebo group, compared with 5.0% in the acetaminophen group (Fisher's exact test, p = 0.014). Prophylactic antipyretic treatment with acetaminophen may be effective in the prevention of fever after acute ischemic stroke.<doc-sep>",

         "The effects of eicosapentaenoic acid in tardive dyskinesia: a randomized, placebo-controlled trial.<doc-sep>Worldwide, conventional antipsychotic medication continues to be used extensively, and tardive dyskinesia (TD) remains a serious complication. The primary objective of the present study was to compare the efficacy of EPA versus placebo in reducing symptoms of TD.\n                This was a 12-week, double-blinded, randomized study of ethyl-EPA 2g/day versus placebo as supplemental medication, in patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder, with established TD.\n                Eighty-four subjects were randomized, of whom 77 were included in the analysis. Both the EPA and placebo groups displayed significant baseline to endpoint improvements in Extrapyramidal Symptom Rating Scale dyskinesia scores, but there were no significant between-group differences (p=0.4). Response rates (>or=30% improvement in TD symptoms) also did not differ significantly between EPA-treated subjects (45%) and placebo-treated subjects (32%) (p=0.6). However, a post-hoc linear mixed model repeated measures analysis of variance indicated an effect for treatment group and duration of TD. The EPA-treated patients had significantly greater mean reductions in dyskinesia scores initially, although this was not sustained beyond 6 weeks.\n                This trial failed to demonstrate an anti-dyskinetic effect for ethyl-EPA 2g/day on the primary efficacy measure. However, a modest and transient benefit is suggested in patients with more recent onset of TD. The lack of clear-cut efficacy could be explained on the basis of the dose of EPA being too low, the study being underpowered, TD being too chronic in the majority of cases, differences in dietary fatty acid intake, or that EPA lacks an anti-dyskinetic action.<doc-sep>Ethyl-eicosapentaenoic acid in first-episode psychosis: a randomized, placebo-controlled trial.<doc-sep>To investigate if ethyl-eicosapentaenoic acid (E-EPA) augmentation improves antipsychotic efficacy and tolerability in first-episode psychosis (FEP).\n                We performed a 12-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of 2-g E-EPA augmentation in 80 FEP patients. Sixty-nine patients were eligible for analysis; a post hoc analysis was computed for a subgroup of nonaffective FEP patients (N = 53). The first participant was included in November 2000 and the last participant completed the trial in August 2003. Primary outcome measures were symptom change scores and time to first response, while tolerability measures and cumulative antipsychotic dose were secondary outcome measures.\n                Analysis of covariance controlling for baseline symptoms found no significant mean difference between E-EPA and placebo at week 12 for symptom change scores. Cox regression analysis revealed a significant treatment by diagnosis interaction (p = .024) for time to first response favoring E-EPA in nonaffective psychosis. Post hoc analysis for cumulative response rates further confirmed a higher response rate at week 6 (42.9% [15/35] vs. 17.6% [6/34] for all participants, p = .036; 54.2% [13/24] vs. 17.2% [5/29] for the nonaffective psychosis subset, p = .008); however, the difference at week 12 was no longer significant. Analysis of secondary outcome measures revealed that E-EPA-augmented participants needed 20% less antipsychotic medication between weeks 4 through 6 (p = .03), had less extrapyramidal side effects in the initial 9 weeks (p < .05 for all participants and for all timepoints), and reported less constipation (p = .011) and fewer sexual side effects (p = .016) than those treated with antipsychotic medication alone.\n                The findings suggest that E-EPA may accelerate treatment response and improve the tolerability of antipsychotic medications. However, it was not possible to demonstrate a sustained symptomatic benefit of E-EPA in early psychosis, possibly due to a ceiling effect, since a high proportion of first-episode patients already achieve symptomatic remission with antipsychotic medication alone. Further controlled trials in nonaffective early psychosis seem warranted.\n                Australian Clinical Trials Registry identifier 12605000267651 (http://actr.org.au).<doc-sep>Randomized, placebo-controlled study of ethyl-eicosapentaenoic acid as supplemental treatment in schizophrenia.<doc-sep>The study investigated the efficacy and tolerability of ethyl-eicosapentaenoic acid (E-EPA) as add-on treatment in chronic, severe schizophrenia.\n                A randomized, parallel-group, double-blind, placebo-controlled, fixed-dose, add-on study was conducted over 12 weeks. Forty patients with persistent symptoms after at least 6 months of stable antipsychotic treatment received E-EPA or placebo, in addition to their existing treatment.\n                At 12 weeks, the E-EPA group had significantly greater reduction of Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale total scores and of dyskinesia scores than the placebo group.\n                EPA may be an effective and well-tolerated add-on treatment in schizophrenia.<doc-sep>Essential fatty acid supplementation in tardive dyskinesia.<doc-sep>Preclinical and clinical observations suggest that enhancement of prostaglandin activity inhibits catecholamine release and may have antidyskinetic effects.

Assessments were performed at baseline and at weeks 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, and 16; a cognitive battery was administered at baseline and at week 16.\n                No differences were found between groups in positive or negative symptoms, mood, cognition, or global impression ratings. Results were similar for the intention-to-treat (N=87) and completer (N=75) groups.\n                For schizophrenia patients treated with 3 g/day of ethyl EPA, improvement in residual symptoms and cognitive impairment was no greater than for schizophrenia patients treated with placebo.<doc-sep>Two double-blind placebo-controlled pilot studies of eicosapentaenoic acid in the treatment of schizophrenia.<doc-sep>Evidence that the metabolism of phospholipids and polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) is abnormal in schizophrenia provided the rationale for intervention studies using PUFA supplementation. An initial open label study indicating efficacy for n-3 PUFA in schizophrenia led to two small double-blind pilot studies. The first study was designed to distinguish between the possible effects of two different n-3 PUFA: eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docohexaenoic acid (DHA). Forty-five schizophrenic patients on stable antipsychotic medication who were still symptomatic were treated with either EPA, DHA or placebo for 3 months. Improvement on EPA measured by the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) was statistically superior to both DHA and placebo using changes in percentage scores on the total PANSS. EPA was significantly superior to DHA for positive symptoms using ANOVA for repeated measures. In the second placebo-controlled study, EPA was used as a sole treatment, though the use of antipsychotic drugs was still permitted if this was clinically imperative. By the end of the study, all 12 patients on placebo, but only eight out of 14 patients on EPA, were taking antipsychotic drugs. Despite this, patients taking EPA had significantly lower scores on the PANSS rating scale by the end of the study. It is concluded that EPA may represent a new treatment approach to schizophrenia, and this requires investigation by large-scale placebo-controlled trials.<doc-sep>A dose-ranging exploratory study of the effects of ethyl-eicosapentaenoate in patients with persistent schizophrenic symptoms.<doc-sep>The objective was to test effects of ethyl eicosapentaenoate (E-E) on persistent ongoing symptoms in patients receiving different types of anti-schizophrenic drugs, typical antipsychotics, new atypical antipsychotics, and clozapine. 115 patients with DSM-IV-defined schizophrenia were studied, 31 on clozapine, 48 on new atypical drugs and 36 on typical antipsychotics. Placebo or 1, 2 or 4 g/day of E-E was given for 12 weeks in addition to the background medication. The main assessment was change from baseline to 12 weeks on the PANSS and its sub-scales. There were no treatment-related side effects or adverse biochemical or haematological effects. Patients on 2 and 4 g/day E-E showed significant reductions in triglyceride levels which had been elevated by clozapine. In patients given 2 g/day E-E there were improvements on the PANSS and its sub-scales, but there was also a large placebo effect in patients on typical and new atypical antipsychotics and no difference between active treatment and placebo. In patients on clozapine, in contrast, there was little placebo response, but a clinically important and statistically significant effect of E-E on all rating scales. This effect was greatest at 2 g/day. There was a positive relationship between improvement on rating scales and rise in red blood cell arachidonic acid concentration.<doc-sep>",
