However, the extent of surgical resection required to achieve optimal cytoreduction is controversial. Our goal was to estimate the effect of aggressive surgical resection on ovarian cancer patient survival.\\n                A retrospective cohort study of consecutive patients with International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics stage IIIC ovarian cancer undergoing primary surgery was conducted between January 1, 1994, and December 31, 1998. The main outcome measures were residual disease after cytoreduction, frequency of radical surgical resection, and 5-year disease-specific survival.\\n                The study comprised 194 patients, including 144 with carcinomatosis. The mean patient age and follow-up time were 64.4 and 3.5 years, respectively. After surgery, 131 (67.5%) of the 194 patients had less than 1 cm of residual disease (definition of optimal cytoreduction). Considering all patients, residual disease was the only independent predictor of survival; the need to perform radical procedures to achieve optimal cytoreduction was not associated with a decrease in survival. For the subgroup of patients with carcinomatosis, residual disease and the performance of radical surgical procedures were the only independent predictors. Disease-specific survival was markedly improved for patients with carcinomatosis operated on by surgeons who most frequently used radical procedures compared with those least likely to use radical procedures (44% versus 17%, P < .001).\\n                Overall, residual disease was the only independent predictor of survival. Minimizing residual disease through aggressive surgical resection was beneficial, especially in patients with carcinomatosis.\\n                II-2.']",
         "We found only low quality evidence comparing ultra-radical and standard surgery in women with advanced ovarian cancer and carcinomatosis. The evidence suggested that ultra-radical surgery may result in better survival.Â  It was unclear whether there were any differences in progression-free survival, QoL and morbidity between the two groups. The cost-effectiveness of this intervention has not been investigated. We are, therefore, unable to reach definite conclusions about the relative benefits and adverse effects of the two types of surgery.\nIn order to determine the role of ultra-radical surgery in the management of advanced stage ovarian cancer, a sufficiently powered randomised controlled trial comparing ultra-radical and standard surgery or well-designed non-randomised studies would be required."

         "['To determine whether a course of low-dose indomethacin therapy, when initiated within 24 hours of birth, would decrease ductal shunting in premature infants who received prophylactic surfactant in the delivery room.\\n                Ninety infants, with birth weights of 600 to 1250 gm, were entered into a prospective, randomized, controlled trial to receive either indomethacin, 0.1 mg/kg per dose, or placebo less than 24 hours and again every 24 hours for six doses. Echocardiography was performed on day 1 before treatment and on day 7, 24 hours after treatment. A hemodynamically significant patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) was confirmed with an out-of-study echocardiogram, and the nonresponders were treated with standard indomethacin or ligation.\\n                Forty-three infants received indomethacin (birth weight, 915 +/- 209 gm; gestational age, 26.4 +/- 1.6 weeks; 25 boys), and 47 received placebo (birth weight, 879 +/- 202 gm; gestational age, 26.4 +/- 1.8 weeks; 22 boys) (P = not significant). Of 90 infants, 77 (86%) had a PDA by echocardiogram on the first day of life before study treatment; 84% of these PDAs were moderate or large in size in the indomethacin-treated group compared with 93% in the placebo group. Nine of forty indomethacin-treated infants (21%) were study-dose nonresponders compared with 22 (47%) of 47 placebo-treated infants (p < 0.018). There were no significant differences between both groups in any of the long-term outcome variables, including intraventricular hemorrhage, duration of oxygen therapy, endotracheal intubation, duration of stay in neonatal intensive care unit, time to regain birth weight or reach full caloric intake, incidence of bronchopulmonary dysplasia, and survival. No significant differences were noted in the incidence of oliguria, elevated plasma creatinine concentration, thrombocytopenia, pulmonary hemorrhage, or necrotizing enterocolitis.\\n                The prophylactic use of low doses of indomethacin, when initiated in the first 24 hours of life in low birth weight infants who receive prophylactic surfactant in the delivery room, decreases the incidence of left-to-right shunting at the level of the ductus arteriosus.'\n 'A prospective, random selection, double-blind clinical trial was carried out to determine the efficacy of indomethacin in preventing periventricular-intraventricular hemorrhage (PV-IVH). Babies who were born in our institution, had birth weights less than or equal to 1500 gm, and had no PV-IVH or grade 1 PV-IVH were given either placebo (n = 70) or indomethacin (n = 71), 0.2 mg/kg intravenously at 6 hours of age and 0.1 mg/kg at 18 and 30 hours. Two major outcomes were determined: the development of grades 2 to 4 PV-IVH and the development of severe PV-IVH (i.e., hemorrhages with blood filling greater than 50% of the ventricles and in some cases with associated parenchymal echodensities). Grades 2 to 4 PV-IVH occurred in 16 (23%) of the indomethacin group and 27 (39%) of the placebo group (p less than 0.03). The incidence of severe PV-IVH was 3% in the indomethacin-treated babies and 14% in the control group (p less than 0.02). The influence of other perinatal factors on the incidence of grades 2 to 4 or severe PV-IVH was determined by stepwise logistic regression. Placebo use, early grade 1 PV-IVH, lower birth weight, and higher fraction of inspired oxygen at 6 hours of life were associated with higher estimated odds of the development of grades 2 to 4 PV-IVH. Placebo use, male gender, lower 5-minute Apgar score, and a large base deficit were predictive of severe PV-IVH. Estimated odds ratios of severe PV-IVH with placebo use and male gender were 11.25:1 and 9:1, respectively. Thus indomethacin prophylaxis reduced the relative risk of grades 2 to 4 PV-IVH and severe PV-IVH, but other perinatal variables contributed significantly to the overall risk of PV-IVH.'\n 'One hundred twenty-two preterm infants were enrolled in a placebo-controlled, double-blind trial using intravenous indomethacin for the prevention of periventricular-intraventricular hemorrhage (PVH-IVH). Before random assignment, data on the infants were stratified according to low-weight (500 to 999 g) or high-weight (1000 to 1500 g) subgroups. Cranial sonography was used to document the absence of PVH-IVH before enrollment and the occurrence of PVH-IVH during the 7-day protocol. Indomethacin, 0.1 mg/kg, or placebo was administered before 12 hours of age and at 24, 48, and 72 hours of age. Five patients receiving indomethacin and six receiving placebo were withdrawn before completion of the study. In the remaining 111 patients, the indomethacin and placebo groups were comparable with respect to gestational ages, maternal complications, Apgar scores, ventilatory requirements, complications of prematurity, and mortality rate. PVH-IVH developed in six of 56 infants who received indomethacin and 11 of 55 infants who received placebo (P = 0.174). Analysis of the individual strata showed that the indomethacin-treated infants in the low-weight subgroup sustained a higher mortality rate (11/17 vs 3/16; P = 0.008) without a reduction in the incidence of PVH-IVH. Infants in the indomethacin-treated high-weight subgroup demonstrated a significantly lower incidence of PVH-IVH (2/39 vs 8/39; P = 0.04), but the frequency of high-grade hemorrhages was comparable for both indomethacin- and placebo-treated groups. In summary, the prophylactic administration of intravenous indomethacin for the prevention of PVH-IVH cannot be recommended for infants less than 1000 g. In preterm infants between 1000 and 1500 g birth weight, indomethacin significantly reduced the incidence of PVH-IVH.'\n 'Infants weighing 1500 g at birth requiring either intermittent positive pressure ventilation or continuous positive airway pressure by 12 hours of age were entered in a randomized double blind controlled trial to test the efficacy of early intravenous indomethacin therapy in preventing chronic pulmonary disease of prematurity. Of the 30 newborns enrolled, 15 were treated with indomethacin and 15 were treated with placebo at 12, 24 and 36 hours of age. The groups were similar for birth weight, gestational age, sex, hyaline membrane disease and intracranial hemorrhage. Infants in the placebo group were successfully weaned from intermittent positive pressure ventilation at an earlier age than infants in the indomethacin group (p less than 0.05). Furthermore, chronic pulmonary disease of prematurity was similar in the two groups despite a reduction in the incidence of patent ductus arteriosus in the indomethacin group.'\n 'We enrolled 61 neonates of 600 to 1250 gm birth weight with evidence of low-grade intraventricular hemorrhage at 6 to 11 hours of age in a prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled trial to test the hypothesis that indomethacin (0.1 mg/kg given intravenously at 6 to 12 postnatal hours and every 24 hours for two more doses) would prevent extension of intraventricular hemorrhage. Twenty-seven infants were assigned to receive indomethacin; 34 infants received saline placebo. There were no significant differences between the two groups in birth weight, gestational age, sex, Apgar scores, percentage of infants treated with surfactant, or distribution of hemorrhages at the time of the first cranial sonogram (echo-encephalogram). Within the first 5 days, 9 of 27 indomethacin-treated and 12 of 34 saline solution-treated infants had extension of their initial intraventricular hemorrhage (p = 1.00). Four indomethacin-treated and three saline solution-treated infants had parenchymal extension of the hemorrhage. Indomethacin was associated with closure of a patent ductus arteriosus by the fifth day of life (p = 0.003). There were no differences in adverse events attributed to indomethacin. We conclude that in very low birth weight infants with low grade intraventricular hemorrhage within the first 6 postnatal hours, prophylactic indomethacin therapy promotes closure of the patent ductus arteriosus and is not associated with adverse events, but does not affect the cascade of events leading to parenchymal involvement of intracranial hemorrhage.'\n 'The prophylactic administration of indomethacin reduces the frequency of patent ductus arteriosus and severe intraventricular hemorrhage in very-low-birth-weight infants (those with birth weights below 1500 g). Whether prophylaxis with indomethacin confers any long-term benefits that outweigh the risks of drug-induced reductions in renal, intestinal, and cerebral blood flow is not known.\\n                Soon after they were born, we randomly assigned 1202 infants with birth weights of 500 to 999 g (extremely low birth weight) to receive either indomethacin (0.1 mg per kilogram of body weight) or placebo intravenously once daily for three days. The primary outcome was a composite of death, cerebral palsy, cognitive delay, deafness, and blindness at a corrected age of 18 months. Secondary long-term outcomes were hydrocephalus necessitating the placement of a shunt, seizure disorder, and microcephaly within the same time frame. Secondary short-term outcomes were patent ductus arteriosus, pulmonary hemorrhage, chronic lung disease, ultrasonographic evidence of intracranial abnormalities, necrotizing enterocolitis, and retinopathy.\\n                Of the 574 infants with data on the primary outcome who were assigned to prophylaxis with indomethacin, 271 (47 percent) died or survived with impairments, as compared with 261 of the 569 infants (46 percent) assigned to placebo (odds ratio, 1.1; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.8 to 1.4; P=0.61). Indomethacin reduced the incidence of patent ductus arteriosus (24 percent vs. 50 percent in the placebo group; odds ratio, 0.3; P<0.001) and of severe periventricular and intraventricular hemorrhage (9 percent vs. 13 percent in the placebo group; odds ratio, 0.6; P=0.02). No other outcomes were altered by the prophylactic administration of indomethacin.\\n                In extremely-low-birth-weight infants, prophylaxis with indomethacin does not improve the rate of survival without neurosensory impairment at 18 months, despite the fact that it reduces the frequency of patent ductus arteriosus and severe periventricular and intraventricular hemorrhage.'\n 'We admitted 36 preterm neonates (600 to 1250 gm birth weight) with normal 6-hour echoencephalograms to a randomized, placebo-controlled prospective trial to determine whether a low dose of indomethacin would prevent germinal matrix or intraventricular hemorrhage and permit adequate urinary output. Between the sixth and tenth postnatal hours, indomethacin (0.1 mg/kg) or placebo was administered intravenously every 24 hours for a total of three doses. Cardiac ultrasound studies to assess the status of the ductus arteriosus were performed at 6 postnatal hours and on day 5. Urinary output, serum electrolytes, serum indomethacin levels, and renal and clotting functions were monitored. No differences in birth weight, gestational age, or Apgar scores were noted between the two groups of infants. Two indomethacin-treated infants and three infants given placebo had significant urinary output difficulties, requiring that the study medication be withheld. Of 19 infants given indomethacin, two had germinal matrix or intraventricular hemorrhage, in comparison with 8 of 17 infants given saline solution (p = 0.02). Of the infants who had a left-to-right patent ductus arteriosus shunt before treatment, 64% of the indomethacin-treated and 33% of the saline solution-treated infants no longer had a patent ductus arteriosus on day 5. Ductal status appeared unrelated to the development of germinal matrix or intraventricular hemorrhage.'\n 'The impact of early prophylactic use of intravenous indomethacin on the incidence and severity of periventricular-intraventricular hemorrhage and patent ductus arteriosus in 199 oxygen-requiring premature infants (less than or equal to 1300 g birth weight) was prospectively investigated. The trial was controlled, the infants were randomized, and the investigators were unaware of the group assignments. Patients with minimal (grade I) or no periventricular-intraventricular hemorrhage determined by prestudy echoencephalography were randomized within two birth weight subgroups (500 to 899 and 900 to 1300 g) to receive either prophylactic indomethacin (n = 99) or an equal volume of saline-vehicle placebo (n = 100). The first dose (0.2 mg/kg) was given within 12 hours of delivery and two subsequent doses (0.1 mg/kg) were administered at 12 hourly intervals. Prophylactic indomethacin significantly reduced the incidence of grades II to IV periventricular-intraventricular hemorrhage. Intraventricular hemorrhage was half as common in infants given prophylactic indomethacin as in control infants (23% v 46%, P less than .002). The reduction was manifested in both birth weight subgroups. Results of this study also confirmed a lower incidence of clinically significant patent ductus arteriosus in infants who received prophylactic indomethacin in contrast to those who received placebo (11% v 42%, P less than .001). No significant differences were found between treatment and control groups in the duration of oxygen therapy, mechanical ventilation, or hospitalization or in the incidence of pneumothorax, chronic lung disease, sepsis, necrotizing enterocolitis, retinopathy of prematurity, or death. Early prophylactic indomethacin initiated within 12 hours of delivery is effective in reducing the incidence of intraventricular hemorrhage as well as clinically significant patent ductus arteriosus in very low birth weight premature infants.'\n 'A previous study found that early intravenous indomethacin administration prolonged respiratory support in very low birth weight infants. We have, therefore, designed a randomized, double blind controlled study to evaluate the oxygenation, and surfactant requirements in preterm low birth weight infants receiving early indomethacin administration. Premature neonates who received surfactant therapy and on mechanical ventilation were prospectively randomized to receive either placebo or indomethacin (0.2 mg/kg intravenously at 12 postnatal hours and every 24 h for two more doses). Oxygenation was assessed by FiO2 required and arterial/alveolar oxygen (a/A O2) ratio during the first 48 h of life. The doses of surfactant were compared between the two groups. Twenty-seven infants (n = 14 of early indomethacin and n = 13 of placebo group) fulfilled inclusion criteria. At admission to the study, there were no differences in the birth weight, gestational age, sex, Apgar scores, a/A O2 ratio, and FiO2. The control group exhibited a significant improvement in oxygenation (FiO2 requirement and a/A O2 compared with the early indomethacin group at 24 (P = 0.026 and 0.02, respectively) and 48 h of life (P = 0.037 and 0.026, respectively). The requirement of surfactant was significantly larger in the early indomethacin group (P = 0.029). Early indomethacin administration increases oxygen and surfactant requirement.'\n 'To determine the efficacy of indomethacin to prevent the occurrence of symptomatic patent ductus arteriosus (PDA), a randomized clinical trial was conducted involving 32 preterm infants weighing 750 to 1500 g at birth who had hyaline membrane disease. By random assignment, 15 infants were given a single dose of indomethacin, 0.2 mg/kg intravenously, 24 hours after birth. Seventeen infants composed a control group for which indomethacin was reserved as treatment for symptomatic PDA. Birth weight, gestational age, male/female ratio, black/white ratio, and severity of disease were similar for both groups. Only one of the 14 survivors who received prophylactic indomethacin had symptomatic PDA, compared with nine of the 16 survivors in the control group (P = 0.007). There was no difference between the groups in development of bronchopulmonary dysplasia, duration of time endotracheal intubation, was required, duration in oxygen, duration to reach full feedings and regain birth weight, and duration of hospital stay. There was no difference between the two groups in incidence of intraventricular hemorrhage, and none developed necrotizing enterocolitis. These results indicate that the use of prophylactic indomethacin is beneficial in prevention of symptomatic PDA; the lack of differences in pulmonary sequelae or other complications may have been related to a population sample size not large enough to impart sufficient statistical power.'\n 'We admitted 48 preterm neonates (600 to 1250 gm birth weight, normal 6-hour echoencephalograms) to a randomized prospective indomethacin or placebo trial for the prevention of neonatal intraventricular hemorrhage. Beginning at 6 postnatal hours, indomethacin or placebo was administered intravenously every 12 hours for a total of five doses. Cardiac ultrasound studies to assess the status of the ductus arteriosus were performed at 6 postnatal hours and on day 5. Urinary output, serum electrolytes, and renal and clotting functions were monitored. No differences in birth weight, gestational age, Apgar scores, or ventilatory needs were noted between the two groups. Six infants given indomethacin had intraventricular hemorrhage, compared to 14 control infants (P = 0.02). The indomethacin-treated group had significant decreases in serum prostaglandin values 30 hours after the initiation of therapy. The overall incidence of patent ductus arteriosus was 82% at 6 postnatal hours; 84% of the indomethacin-treated infants experienced closure of the ductus, compared to 60% of the placebo-treated patients. Closure of the ductus was not related to incidence of intraventricular hemorrhage. We speculate that indomethacin may provide some protection against neonatal intraventricular hemorrhage by acting on the cerebral microvasculature.'\n 'The results of a double blind study to evaluate the efficiency of prophylactic endovenous indomethacin versus placebo for prevention of intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) in newborn infants between 28 to 36 weeks of age who were intubated at the delivery room and required mechanical ventilation in NICU are presented. Fourty six patients required mechanical ventilation, but 14 neonates had IVH evaluated by ultrasound when were admitted to the Unit. At least 32 infants were studied, 16 for each group. There were no differences between the groups in weight, gestational age, sex and delivery way. The mobility was the same in relation to hialine membrane disease, sepsis, pneumonie and pneumotorax. The placebo group had more frequency of PDA and mortality (P < 0.5). There were no differences in mean airway pressure and arterial gases, also in glucose, platelets and urinary volume. The indomethacin group had mayor urinary density and FeNa but the results were always in normal ranges. The IVH was the same in both groups. We concluded that the indomethacin at the levels used did not produced alterations, and if the IVH is not prevented, were observed lesser severity of the same and the frequency of PDA and mortality are lesser. But still is necessary more number of cases for best conclusions.'\n 'To investigate the optimal timing for treatment of small premature infants, we performed a double-blind, controlled trial of indomethacin therapy on the first day of life in 104 infants weighing between 700 and 1300 gm. Infants were given indomethacin or placebo at a mean age of 15 hours. Eleven of the 56 infants given placebo developed large left-to-right shunts through a patent ductus arteriosus. In contrast, only two of the 51 infants given indomethacin developed large shunts (P less than 0.025). There were no significant differences in incidence of surgical ligation, duration of oxygen therapy, duration of endotracheal intubation, days required to regain birth weight, or incidence of complications. However, the power of the tests of significance was low because of the small number of patients. Thus, although the incidence of large left-to-right ductus shunts was decreased in the indomethacin group, morbidity was not otherwise altered for the entire group of patients, possibly because of the relatively low incidence (21%) of large shunts in the placebo group. We conclude that although treatment with indomethacin on the first day of life appears to be safe, there is little advantage to its use in centers where the incidence of large shunts through a patent ductus arteriosus is relatively low.'\n 'Very low birth weight (VLBW, less than 1500 g) and extremely low birth weight infants (ELBW, less than 1000 g) are the premature infants that are most likely to develop symptomatic PDA. Intravenous indomethacin has proven effective in prevention of PDA in many prospective trials. This strategy will be a useful adjunctive therapy for premature infants in Thailand.\\n                To answer the following questions: 1. Will multiple doses of intravenous indomethacin, given to VLBW infants within the first day of life, effectively prevent the occurrence of symptomatic PDA? Are there any side effects or complications? 2. Will this strategy be more beneficial in ELBW?\\n                The study included thirty VLBW infants born at Ramathibodi Hospital, with birth weights ranging from 630 to 1230 g. They were randomized into 2 groups of 15 infants each. One group received 3 doses of intravenous indomethacin at the dosage of 0.2 mg/kg initially and then 0.1 mg/kg every 12 hours for 2 more doses; the second group received a placebo. The study was performed by a double blind control.\\n                Sixteen infants developed symptomatic PDA, 4 in the indomethacin group and 12 in the placebo group. The decrease in incidence of PDA is statistically significant. But when the data was analyzed separately for the VLBW and ELBW groups. The effects were only significantly different in ELBW but not yet significant in the VLBW group. There was a statistically significant difference in the incidence of severe intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) (grade 3 or higher) in the ELBW infants.\\n                Intravenous indomethacin therapy given to VLBW infants with a birth weight of less than 1250 g decreased incidence of symptomatic PDA with no significant permanent side effects. The effect was markedly noticeable in ELBW infants. Incidence of severe IVH was also markedly decreased in the ELBW infants who received indomethacin.']",

The design was a single-blind test of a neuropsychological intervention, with pre- and post-treatment assessments of personality and social behavior. MS patients underwent neurological examination and neuropsychological testing at baseline. The patients were then randomly assigned to neuropsychological counseling or standard, non-specific supportive psychotherapy. The active 12-week treatment emphasized enhancement of insight through education, social skills training, and behavior modification. All patients were re-examined within 2 weeks of the termination of treatment. Neuropsychological technicians were blind to treatment condition. Both groups showed evidence of cognitive impairment and personality/behavior disorder prior to treatment and were well matched on demographic, disability, and cognitive measures. Patients who underwent neuropsychological counseling showed significant positive response on measures of social behavior (e.g. excessive ego-centric speech) compared to those who underwent standard counseling.

The aim of the study was to evaluate the benefits of providing a psychology service, including cognitive assessment and intervention, to patients with multiple sclerosis.\\n                The study was a single blind randomised controlled trial. A total of 240 patients with clinically definite, laboratory supported, or clinically probable multiple sclerosis were recruited from an multiple sclerosis management clinic and assessed on a brief screening battery. They were randomised into three groups. The control group received no further intervention. The assessment group received a detailed cognitive assessment, the result of which was fed back to staff involved in the patients' care. The treatment group received the same detailed cognitive assessment and a treatment programme designed to help reduce the impact of their cognitive problems. Patients were followed up 4 and 8 months later on the general health questionnaire (GHQ-28), extended activities of daily living scale, SF-36, everyday memory questionnaire, dysexecutive syndrome questionnaire, and memory aids questionnaire.\\n                The three groups were compared on the outcome measures at 4 and 8 months after recruitment. There were few significant differences between the groups and those that occurred favoured the control group. Overall, the results showed no effect of the interventions on mood, quality of life, subjective cognitive impairment or independence.\\n                The study failed to detect any significant effects of cognitive assessment or cognitive intervention in this cohort of people with multiple sclerosis.\"\n 'There has long been a belief that depression contributes to fatigue in multiple sclerosis (MS) although supporting data are minimal at best. Clinical guidelines for the treatment of fatigue include recommendations for the treatment of depression in the absence of clear empirical support. The goal of this study was to examine the effects of treatment for depression on fatigue in MS.\\n                Sixty patients with a relapsing form of MS and moderate to severe depression were randomly assigned to one of three validated 16-week treatments for depression: individual cognitive behavioral therapy, group psychotherapy, or sertraline. Assessments at baseline and treatment cessation included the primary outcome measure, fatigue assessment instrument (FAI), and Beck depression inventory (BDI).\\n                The total FAI and the global fatigue severity subscale were significantly reduced over the course of treatment (p values <.02). Other subscales did not change significantly. Secondary analyses showed change in global fatigue severity was associated with change in BDI (p =.03) but change in total FAI was only marginally related to change in BDI (p =.05). These relationships were due entirely to change in mood (p values <.02) and not to change in cognitive or vegetative symptoms (p values >.17).\\n                These findings suggest that treatment for depression is associated with reductions in the severity of fatigue symptoms, and that this relationship is due primarily to treatment related changes in mood.'\n 'This study investigates the relationship between group psychotherapy and the psychologic adjustment of patients with a primary diagnosis of multiple sclerosis (MS). It was speculated that such a program would decrease both patient depression and anxiety, at the same time increasing self-concept and self-direction. Forty-one hospitalized MS patients were screened for mental status, then administered a test battery consisting of the Depression 30, IPAT Anxiety Scale, Nowicki-Strickland Internal-External Scale, and Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale. Following this, patients were matched into triads on the basis of pretest scores. Each member of the triad was then randomly assigned to one of three groups: insight-oriented, current events, control (nontreatment). At the end of 50 group sessions, all patients were reassessed using the same test battery. Results were analyzed by means of analysis of covariance and the nonparametric Friedman test. Post-hoc procedures were performed with the following results: 1) the insight-oriented therapy group was significantly less depressed than both the current events group and the control group and 2) both the therapy and the current events groups were significantly more internally oriented than the control. Not only does group therapy per se seem to benefit the MS patient, but any supervised group involvement appears to improve significantly patient emotional state.'\n 'This study examined the efficacy of an 8-week telephone-administered cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) for the treatment of depressive symptomatology in multiple sclerosis (MS) patients. The treatment, Coping with MS (CMS), included a patient workbook designed to structure the treatment, provide visual aids, and help with homework assignments. Thirty-two patients with MS, who scored at least 15 on the Profile of Mood States Depression-Dejection scale, were randomly assigned to either the telephone CMS or to a usual-care control (UCC) condition. Depressive symptomatology decreased significantly in the CMS condition compared with the UCC condition. Furthermore, adherence to interferon beta-1a, a disease-modifying medication for the treatment of MS, was significantly better at the 4-month follow-up among patients who received CMS as compared with those in the UCC condition.'\n 'This study compared the efficacy of 3 16-week treatments for depression in 63 patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) and major depressive disorder (MDD): individual cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), supportive-expressive group therapy (SEG). and the antidepressant sertraline. Significant reductions were seen from pre- to posttreatment in all measures of depression. Intent-to-treat and completers analyses using the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI; A. T. Beck, C. H. Ward. M. Medelson. J. Mock, & J. Erbaugh, 1961) and MDD diagnosis found that CBT and sertraline were more effective than SEG at reducing depression. These results were largely supported by the BDI-18, which eliminates BDI items confounded with MS. However, the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (M. Hamilton, 1960) did not show consistent differences between treatments. Reasons for this inconsistency are discussed. These findings suggest that CBT or sertraline is more likely to be effective in treating MDD in MS compared with supportive group treatments.'\n 'Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic, often progressive neurologic disorder characterized by cerebral and spinal cord lesions. Patients with advanced MS often require continuous supervision in a long-term skilled nursing facility. Many of these patients experience clinical levels of depression. For this experiment, we randomly assigned MS patients living in a skilled nursing facility to either a control condition or an extended treatment protocol. The protocol consisted of assigning individual certified nursing assistants (CNAs) to each patient, in-service training for the CNAs, and the use of memory notebooks. All patients completed the short version of the Beck Depression Inventory and several measures of cognitive functioning at the start and end of the study. The results indicate statistically and clinically significant improvements in the depression of patients in the treatment but not in the control condition. These results led to recommendations for the treatment of MS patients living in long-term skilled nursing facilities and for additional research.'\n 'The chronic and progressive nature of multiple sclerosis (MS) often excludes patients from neuropsychological treatment. At the Multiple Sclerosis Rehabilitation Hospital, Haslev, 40 patients with mild to moderate cognitive and behavioral impairment associated with MS were randomized to either specific cognitive treatment (20 pts) by direct training, compensatory strategies and neuropsychotherapy, or to non-specific, deliberately diffuse mental stimulation (20 pts). Treatment was for a mean of 46 days. The effects of treatment were evaluated by neuropsychological tests before treatment, immediately after treatment (short-term effects) and 6 months later (long-term effects). After short-term treatment, effects on cognitive measures were not convincing, but on the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) the specific cognitive treatment group reported significantly less depression. After 6 months only this group showed an effect, since the visuo-spatial memory was improved. However, the depression ratings (BDI) were almost maintained from the short-term level. Interestingly, the non-specific treatment group rated themselves as significantly more depressed. Conclusively, it is worth while to offer specific neuropsychological treatment to MS patients with cognitive and behavioral dysfunction.'\n 'The researchers studied the effectiveness of a nursing intervention in promoting adjustment and symptom management in individuals with multiple sclerosis (MS). This was a 4-year longitudinal study to determine whether the 4-week intensive outpatient program was effective in increasing adjustment to MS and if the treatment effect would last over time. A sample of 27 individuals with MS participated in the study. Treatment participants had significant improvements in symptom management at the 4-year follow up. This improvement was attributable to signficant improvements in sleep and fatigue levels. Although adjustment and self-efficacy scores improved in the treatment group over time, this improvement was not superior to the control group. This was anticipated because the behavioral changes would precede improvement in adjustment to life following the diagnosis of MS.']",
         "The diversity of psychological interventions identified indicates the many ways in which they can potentially help people with MS. No definite conclusions can be made from this review. However there is reasonable evidence that cognitive behavioural approaches are beneficial in the treatment of depression, and in helping people adjust to, and cope with, having MS."

Each patient was randomly assigned to a single dose of study medication: ibuprofen 200 mg (n = 216) or 400 mg (n = 223), or placebo (n = 221). The percentage of patients with a reduction in baseline headache intensity from severe or moderate to mild or none 2 hours after treatment and the headache pain intensity difference from baseline at 2 hours were the primary efficacy measures. Secondary outcomes included other measures of pain relief, severity differences from baseline for migraine-associated symptoms of nausea, photophobia, phonophobia, and functional disability, and percentage of patients with migraine-associated symptoms reduced to none.\\n                Significantly (P < or = .006) more patients treated with ibuprofen, 200 mg or 400 mg, reported mild to no pain after 2 hours (41.7% and 40.8%, respectively), compared with those treated with placebo (28.1%). The mean pain intensity difference from baseline measured at 2 hours was significantly (P < or = .001) greater for patients treated with ibuprofen 200 mg or 400 mg (0.68 and 0.65, respectively), compared with those treated with placebo (0.39). Statistically significant differences in favor of both doses of ibuprofen over placebo were observed for mean pain intensity difference at 1 hour after treatment. In patients with severe baseline pain intensity, ibuprofen, 400 mg, was significantly (P < or = .048) superior to placebo for the primary efficacy end points, while ibuprofen, 200 mg, was not. Ibuprofen, 200 mg and 400 mg, were statistically significantly more effective than placebo for all clinically important secondary pain relief outcomes. Mean severity changes of migraine-associated symptoms of nausea, photophobia, phonophobia, and functional disability at 2 and 6 hours were significantly (P < or = .03) in favor of both doses of ibuprofen over placebo, and results for the percentage of patients with symptoms reduced to none consistently, although less often statistically significant, favored ibuprofen. No statistically significant differences in adverse events were found among treatment groups.\\n                Ibuprofen at doses of 200 mg and 400 mg is an efficacious, cost-effective, well-tolerated, single-ingredient nonprescription treatment for pain of migraine headache. In addition, while not always statistically significant, ibuprofen provided a beneficial effect on associated symptoms of migraine including nausea, photophobia, phonophobia, and functional disability.\"\n 'Acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) in combination with metoclopramide has been frequently used in clinical trials in the acute treatment of migraine attacks. Recently the efficacy of a new high buffered formulation of 1000 mg effervescent ASA without metoclopramide compared to placebo has been shown. To further confirm the efficacy of this new formulation in comparison with a triptan and a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (ibuprofen) a three-fold crossover, double-blind, randomized trial with 312 patients was conducted in Germany, Italy and Spain. Effervescent ASA (1000 mg) was compared to encapsulated sumatriptan (50 mg), ibuprofen (400 mg) and placebo. The percentage of patients with reduction in headache severity from moderate or severe to mild or no pain (primary endpoint) was 52.5% for ASA, 60.2% for ibuprofen, 55.8% for sumatriptan and 30.6% for placebo. All active treatments were superior to placebo (P < 0.0001), whereas active treatments were not statistically different. The number of patients who were pain-free at 2 h was 27.1%, 33.2%, 37.1% and 12.6% for those treated with ASA, ibuprofen, sumatriptan or placebo, respectively. The difference between ASA and sumatriptan was statistically significant (P = 0.025). With respect to other secondary efficacy criteria and accompanying symptoms no statistically significant differences between ASA and ibuprofen or sumatriptan were found. Drug-related adverse events were reported in 4.1%, 5.7%, 6.6% and 4.5% of patients treated with ASA, ibuprofen sumatriptan or placebo. This study showed that 1000 mg effervescent ASA is as effective as 50 mg sumatriptan and 400 mg ibuprofen in the treatment of migraine attacks regarding headache relief from moderate/severe to mild/no pain at 2 h. Regarding pain-free at 2 h sumatriptan was most effective.'\n \"To investigate the efficacy, tolerability, and safety of rofecoxib and ibuprofen for acute migraine treatment.\\n                Rofecoxib was effective and well tolerated in a previous study of treatment of a single migraine attack.

The active drugs were statistically superior to placebo on a variety of additional measures. In the extension phase, the mean percentage of patients' attacks with headache relief at 2 hours postdose was 61.8% for rofecoxib 25 mg, 65.4% for rofecoxib 50 mg, and 59.3% for ibuprofen 400 mg. The mean percentage of patients' attacks with 24-hour sustained headache relief was greater for rofecoxib 50 mg (52.0%) than for rofecoxib 25 mg (47.8%, P < .050) or ibuprofen (39.0%, P < .010). In the single-attack phase, the adverse event rate was higher for rofecoxib 50 mg (37.8%) than placebo (27.8%, P < .050); rates were similar to placebo for rofecoxib 25 mg (32.0%, n.s.) and ibuprofen 400 mg (28.1%, n.s.).

Efficacy was assessed by headache relief, and headache freedom at 2 h and 24 h. Two-hour headache relief, was noted in 73% in rizatriptan, 53.8% in ibuprofen and 8% in placebo groups. Headache freedom was achieved in 37.7% in rizatriptan, 30.8% in ibuprofen and 2% in placebo groups. Rizatriptan was superior to ibuprofen and placebo in relieving headache at 2 h but not at 24 h. Side effects were noted in 9 patients in rizatriptan, 8 in ibuprofen and 3 in placebo, all of which were nonsignificant. Rizatriptan and ibuprofen are superior to placebo. Rizatriptan is superior to ibuprofen in relieving headache, associated symptoms and functional disability.'\n \"Rofecoxib is a potent cyclo-oxygenase-2 inhibitor with a long duration of action.

Migraine patients with 2-6 attacks per month were recruited. Headache severity, functional disability, and severity of associated symptoms were graded on a 0-3 scale. The primary endpoint was pain relief at two hours. Relief of associated symptoms and sustained pain relief for 24 hours were also noted.\\n                One hundred and twenty four patients were randomised into rofecoxib (42), ibuprofen (40), and placebo (42) groups. One hundred and one patients were followed up: 33 on rofecoxib, 35 ibuprofen, and 33 placebo. Patients' ages ranged from 16-62 (mean 31.4) years, and 83 were females. Pain relief at two hours was noted in 45.5% on rofecoxib, 55.6% on ibuprofen, and 9.1% in the placebo group. The associated symptoms at two hours were reduced in 39.4% on rofecoxib, 50% on ibuprofen, and 9.1% in the placebo group. Sustained 24 hour pain relief was noted in 36.4% on rofecoxib, 41% on ibuprofen, and 6.1% in the placebo group. In the ibuprofen group, five patients had abdominal pain but there were no side effects in those on rofecoxib or in the control group.

The 3 treatment groups had similar demographic profiles, migraine histories, and baseline symptom profiles. While both active treatments were significantly better than placebo in relieving the pain and associated symptoms of migraine, AAC was superior to IB for TOTPAR2, as well as for PAR, time to onset of meaningful PAR, pain intensity reduction, headache response, and pain free. The mean TOTPAR2 scores for AAC, IB, and placebo were 2.7, 2.4, and 2.0, respectively (AAC vs. IB, P < .03). The median time to meaningful PAR for AAC was 20 minutes earlier than that of IB (P < .036).\\n                AAC and IB are safe, cost-effective treatments for migraine; AAC provides significantly superior efficacy and speed of onset compared with IB.'\n 'By evaluating the efficacy of metoclopramide alone and in combination with ibuprofen versus placebos, this study was designed to both evaluate the efficacy of metoclopramide and elucidate its mechanism of action in the treatment of migraine headache.\\n                The study was conducted over a two-year period and was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study.\\n                An urban teaching hospital.\\n                Patients enrolled were at least 18 years old and had recurring headaches with one or more of the following characteristics: unilateral, preceded by neurologic symptoms, significant nausea and vomiting, or mood changes and photophobia.\\n                Ten milligrams of metoclopramide or an equal volume of IV normal saline was given and 600 mg of ibuprofen or identical-appearing placebo was given orally at time 0. Patients rated their pain and nausea at time 0, 30 minutes, and 60 minutes using visual-analog scales.\\n                The differences in pain and nausea scores for the metoclopramide + placebos group versus the other three groups were tested using exact nonparametric (Mann-Whitney) statistical procedures. The metoclopramide + placebos group had significantly better relief of pain compared with the placebos + ibuprofen and placebos + placebos groups. The metoclopramide + placebos group had significantly better relief of nausea than the ibuprofen + placebos group; nausea scores for the placebos + placebos group could not be analyzed due to excessive variance from the other groups at baseline. The differences between the metoclopramide + placebos group and the metoclopramide + ibuprofen group were not statistically significant with regard to either pain or nausea.\\n                Metoclopramide is efficacious in the treatment of both the pain and nausea of migraine headache. This is a direct action that is not dependent on the concomitant administration of another agent.'\n 'The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of a new formulation of ibuprofen (ibuprofen-arginine [IA]) in the treatment of migraine attacks. This is a faster absorbed formulation as compared with ibuprofen alone. The rapidity of action is considered to be a crucial factor in the treatment of migraine attacks. Forty migraine patients participated in this multicenter, double-blind, crossover, randomized, placebo-controlled trial. Each patient was treated with a single oral dose of IA 400 mg or placebo during two consecutive migraine attacks. The results confirm the efficacy of IA, with a significant (p < 0.05) improvement in pain relief at 30 min after treatment. A statistically significant (p < 0.001) reduction in pain intensity was observed at 1, 2, 4 and 6 h after treatment with ibuprofen as compared with placebo. IA was well tolerated and our data indicate that this new formulation of ibuprofen is valuable in the treatment of acute migraine attacks.']",
         "We found no new studies since the last version of this review. Ibuprofen is an effective treatment for acute migraine headaches, providing pain relief in about half of sufferers, but complete relief from pain and associated symptoms for only a minority. NNTs for all efficacy outcomes were better with 400 mg than 200 mg in comparisons with placebo, and soluble formulations provided more rapid relief. Adverse events were mostly mild and transient, occurring at the same rate as with placebo."

Patients used human NPH insulin at night with either premeal insulin lispro for 4 months followed by human regular insulin for another 4 months or human regular insulin for 4 months followed by insulin lispro for another 4 months. The main outcome measures were the number of hypoglycemic episodes during both treatments and HbA1c level.\\n                A total of 135 patients were randomized, with 68 receiving insulin lispro and 67 receiving human regular insulin for the first 4 months. The data for the first 4 months of treatment only were compared as two independent groups because of a period effect and a treatment-period interaction. Glycemic control was equally tight during treatment with human regular insulin (HbA1c, 6.2 +/- 0.8%) and insulin lispro (6.0 +/- 0.9%). A total of 1,156 hypoglycemic episodes occurred during treatment with human regular insulin compared with 775 hypoglycemic episodes that occurred during treatment with insulin lispro (P = 0.04). This difference was chiefly because of a reduced number of nocturnal episodes (181 vs. 52, P = 0.001) in the insulin lispro group.\\n                The use of a fast-acting insulin analog, insulin lispro, as part of a basal bolus regimen reduces nocturnal hypoglycemia in patients with type 1 diabetes who maintain tight glycemic control during intensive insulin therapy.'\n 'To assess the potential of insulin lispro to limit the frequency of severe hypoglycaemia without compromising glycaemic control in a cohort of patients with type 1 diabetes who are at a high risk of severe hypoglycemia. Research design and methods An open-label, randomised, 12-month comparative crossover study of insulin lispro and regular human insulin was performed in 33 patients with type 1 diabetes with impaired hypoglycaemia awareness. The efficacy of each treatment was evaluated by glycaemic control (HbA(1c)), eight-point home blood glucose profiles, and the frequency and severity of hypoglycaemic episodes and quality of life.\\n                Eighteen (55%) patients experienced one or more episodes of severe hypoglycaemia in the 48 weeks of study. There was a trend to a lower incidence of severe hypoglycaemia during treatment with insulin lispro in comparison with regular human insulin (55 vs 84 episodes, p=0.087). This resulted principally from a 47% lower incidence of nocturnal severe hypoglycaemia with insulin lispro (25 vs 47 episodes, p=0.11). The lower frequency of severe hypoglycaemia associated with insulin lispro was not explained by differences in glycated haemoglobin between insulin treatments (HbA(1c) 9.1% insulin lispro vs 9.3% regular human insulin).\\n                In individuals with type 1 diabetes, who have impaired awareness of hypoglycaemia, treatment with insulin lispro may be associated with a lower incidence of severe hypoglycaemia manifested predominantly through less frequent nocturnal episodes. Insulin lispro may have a beneficial role in the management of patients with diabetes at risk of severe hypoglycaemia, although a larger study is required to confirm these findings.\\n                Copyright 2001 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.'\n 'The aim of the study was to examine the effects of intensive insulin therapy using lispro on metabolic control, immunogenicity and beta-cell function of newly diagnosed type 1 diabetic subjects in comparison with intensive insulin therapy using regular insulin. An open study was conducted in 45 newly diagnosed type 1 diabetic subjects. Patients were randomly assigned to intensive insulin therapy using insulin lispro (lispro) (lispro, n=22; 22.8 years) or intensive insulin therapy using regular insulin (regular) (regular, n=23; 24.4 years): three to five injections of subcutaneous rapid-acting insulin before meals and Neutral Protamine Hagedorn (NPH) before dinner/bed-time. GAD, IA2, insulin antibodies, basal and stimulated plasma C-peptide and HbA(1c) were measured initially and at months 1, 4, 8 and 12. Daily blood glucose profiles tended to be lower in the lispro group, particularly values after breakfast, without reaching statistical significance. There were no differences in terms of HbA(1c) throughout the study. The proportion of subjects achieving an HbA(1c)<6% at the end of the study was similar in both groups (regular 73.9%, lispro 68.0%). The number of mild hypoglycemic episodes tended to be lower with lispro, but not significantly. beta-Cell function was not significantly different in both groups. During follow-up there were no differences in antibodies, including IAAb. In summary, insulin lispro used in intensive insulin therapy is as effective as regular insulin in optimizing metabolic control and preserving beta-cell function at diagnosis of type 1 diabetes.'\n 'Humalog Mix25 is a manufactured premixed insulin formulation containing insulin lispro and a novel insulin lispro-protamine formulation (NPL) in a ratio of 25:75%.

Overall glycemic control and the incidence of hypoglycemia were comparable between the treatments.\\n                In comparison to treatment with human insulin 30/70, twice daily administration of Humalog Mix25 resulted in improved postprandial glycemic control, similar overall glycemic control, and the convenience of dosing immediately before meals.'\n 'The objective of this 6-month, open-label, randomized, two-period crossover study was to compare glycemic control when patients were treated with (1) 2 manufactured premixed insulin formulations containing insulin lispro and a novel insulin lispro-protamine formulation, neutral protamine lispro (NPL), and (2) 2 manufactured premixed human insulin formulations, human insulin 50/50 and human insulin 30/70. One hundred individuals, 37 with type 1 diabetes mellitus (12 females, 25 males; mean age, 39.4 years; mean body mass index [BMI], 24.8; mean duration of diabetes, 12.9 years) and 63 with type 2 diabetes mellitus (33 females, 30 males; mean age, 59.0 years; mean BMI, 28.4; mean duration of diabetes, 12.6 years), were treated with insulin lispro mixtures.

Blood glucose (BG), hypoglycemic episodes (hypoglycemic signs or symptoms or BG <3.0 mmol/L), insulin dose and timing of dose before meals, and hemoglobin A1c were measured. Mean doses of insulin lispro and human insulin mixtures were similar overall and for both diabetes subgroups. However, compared with human insulin mixtures, twice-daily administration of insulin lispro mixtures resulted in improved postprandial glycemic control, similar overall glycemic control, and less nocturnal hypoglycemia, as well as offering the convenience of dosing closer to meals.'\n 'Although insulin lispro (insulin LP) has been shown to improve postprandial blood glucose (BG) control and reduce hypoglycemic episodes in adult patients with type I diabetes, there appear to have been few clinical studies focusing on its use in adolescents.\\n                This study compared the effects of insulin LP with those of regular human insulin (insulin R) on postprandial BG control and hypoglycemia in adolescents with type diabetes.\\n                In this crossover, open-label study, adolescents between the ages of 9 and 18 years who had reached Tanner stage II puberty were randomized to receive either insulin LP immediately before meals or insulin R 30 to 45 minutes before meals, in addition to daily intermediate-acting insulin. After 4 months, patients were switched to the alternate treatment sequence. Eight-point BG profiles, hypoglycemia rate, and glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) were measured at baseline and end point.\\n                Four hundred eighty-one adolescents participated in the study at 53 investigative sites in 15 countries; 463 were randomized to treatment (228 insulin LP, 235 insulin R), and 457 completed the study. Insulin LP given before breakfast resulted in significantly lower mean (+/-SD) 2-hour postprandial BG levels compared with insulin R (9.7 +/- 4.0 mmol/L vs 10.6 +/- 4.3 mmol/L, respectively; P < 0.001). Insulin LP given before dinner resulted in significantly lower 2-hour postprandial BG levels compared with insulin R (8.6 +/- 3.5 mmol/L vs 9.3 +/- 3.7 mmol/L; P = 0.003). No differences were seen between treatments in 2-hour postprandial BG levels after the midday meal. Mean baseline HbA1c values were similar between sequence groups, and no between-group difference in HbA1c was observed at end point (insulin LP, 8.69% +/- 1.52%; insulin R, 8.70% +/- 1.65%). Treatment with insulin LP resulted in a significantly lower incidence of hypoglycemic episodes per patient per 30 days compared with insulin R (4.02 +/- 4.5 vs 4.37 +/- 4.5, respectively; P = 0.023) and significantly fewer hypoglycemic episodes between midnight and 6 AM (1.0 +/- 1.9 vs 1.7 +/- 2.6; P < 0.001).\\n                In adolescents with type 1 diabetes, insulin LP significantly improved postprandial glycemic control and reduced episodes of nocturnal hypoglycemia compared with insulin R.

Subjects administered IAsp immediately before meals or regular HI 30 min before meals; basal NPH insulin was taken as a single bedtime dose in the majority of subjects. Glycemic control was assessed with HbA1c values and 8-point blood glucose profiles at 3-month intervals.\\n                Mean postprandial blood glucose levels (mg/dl +/- SEM) were significantly lower for subjects in the IAsp group compared with subjects in the HI group after breakfast (156 +/- 3.4 vs. 185 +/- 4.7), lunch (137 +/- 3.1 vs. 162 +/- 4.1), and dinner (153 +/- 3.1 vs. 168 +/- 4.1), when assessed after 6 months of treatment. Mean HbA1c values (% +/- SEM) were slightly, but significantly, lower for the IAsp group (7.78% +/- 0.03) than for the regular HI group (7.93% +/- 0.05, P = 0.005) at 6 months. Similar postprandial blood glucose and HbA1c values were observed at 12 months. Adverse events and overall hypoglycemic episodes were similar for both treatment groups.\\n                Postprandial glycemic control was significantly better with IAsp compared with HI after 6 and 12 months of treatment. The improvement was not obtained at an increased risk of hypoglycemia.

In this 24-week multicenter, randomized, two-way crossover, open-label trial, 58 patients on CSII with adequate glycemic control received either insulin lispro or buffered regular human insulin for 12 weeks, followed by the alternate treatment for another 12 weeks. Efficacy and safety measures included hemoglobin A(1c) (HbA(1c)) at baseline and endpoint, home blood glucose monitoring, hypoglycemia, and frequency of pump catheter occlusion. Patients consumed a standard test meal on three occasions, with determinations of fasting, 1- and 2-h postprandial glucose values. Insulin lispro use was associated with a significantly lower HbA(1c) than was buffered regular human insulin (7.41+/-0.97 vs. 7.65+/-0.85 mmol/l; P=.004). Fasting serum glucose values before the test meal were similar between the two therapies. The 1-h (11.16+/-4.29 vs. 13.20+/-4.68 mmol/l; P=.012) and 2-h (9.64+/-4.10 vs. 12.53+/-4.64 mmol/l; P=.001) postprandial glucose concentrations were significantly lower during treatment with insulin lispro. No differences between treatments were observed in basal or bolus insulin doses, weight gain, or the incidence and rate of hypoglycemia, hyperglycemia, or pump occlusions. When used in external pumps, insulin lispro provides better glycemic control than buffered regular human insulin with a similar adverse event profile.'\n 'The long duration of action of soluble insulin given in the evening could contribute to the high prevalence of nocturnal hypoglycaemia seen in young children with Type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM). We examined whether replacing soluble insulin with insulin lispro reduced this risk in children on a three times daily insulin regimen.\\n                Open crossover study comparing insulin lispro vs. soluble insulin in 23 (16 boys) prepubertal children (age 7-11 years) with T1DM on three injections/day; long-acting isophane insulin remained identical. At the end of each 4-month treatment arm, an overnight 15-min venous sampled blood glucose profile was performed.\\n                Despite similar blood glucose levels pre-evening meal (lispro vs. soluble: mean +/- se 6.5 +/- 1.0 vs. 7.1 +/- 1.1 mmol/l, P = 0.5), post-meal (18.00-22.00 h) blood glucose levels were lower on insulin lispro (area under curve 138 +/- 12 vs. 170 +/- 13 mmol min-1 l-1, P = 0.03). In contrast, in the early night (22.00-04.00 h) the prevalence of low blood glucose levels (< 3.5 mmol/l) was lower on lispro (8% of blood glucose levels) than on soluble insulin (13%, P = 0.01). In the early morning (04.00-07.00 h) mean blood glucose and prevalence of low levels were no different between the two treatment groups, and fasting (07.00 h) blood glucose levels were similar (6.1 +/- 0.8 vs. 6.3 +/- 0.9 mmol/l, P = 0.8). At the end of each treatment arm there were no differences in HbA1c (lispro vs. soluble 8.6% vs. 8.4%, P = 0.3), or in insulin doses (mean, range 0.97, 0.68-1.26 vs. 0.96, 0.53-1.22 U/kg per day, P = 0.2).\\n                The shorter duration of action of insulin lispro given before the evening meal may reduce the prevalence of early nocturnal hypoglycaemia without compromising HbA1c in young children with T1DM.'\n 'The purpose of this study was to compare the efficacy, safety and pump compatibility of insulin aspart (a rapid-acting insulin analog) and buffered regular human insulin in patients with type 1 diabetes undergoing continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) therapy.\\n                This was a single-center randomized open-label study Patients received CSII therapy with insulin aspart (n = 19) or buffered regular human insulin (n = 10) for 7 weeks. Bolus doses of insulin aspart were administered immediately before meals and buffered regular human insulin 30 min before meals.\\n                Insulin aspart and buffered regular human insulin were both effective in controlling average daily blood glucose levels (8.2 +/- 1.9 and 8.5 +/- 2.1 mmol/l, respectively) (mean +/- SD) and maintaining serum fructosamine (343 +/- 25.7 and 336 +/- 27.4 micromol/l) and HbA1c (6.9 +/- 0.6 and 7.1 +/- 0.6%) levels. Possible obstructions and set leakages were infrequently reported in both groups. Similar numbers of patients experienced hypoglycemia (blood glucose <2.5 mmol/l): 14 (74%) insulin aspart patients versus 6 (60%) buffered regular human insulin patients. Patients receiving insulin aspart had fewer hypoglycemic events per patient (2.9) than those patients receiving buffered regular human insulin (6.2). There were no differences between the two insulins in the occurrence of hyperglycemic events (blood glucose >19 mmol/l) or in the number and type of adverse events.\\n                Insulin aspart and buffered regular human insulin were effective and well tolerated and provided similar pump compatibility when used in CSII therapy.'\n 'To establish whether lispro may be a suitable short-acting insulin preparation for meals in intensive treatment of Type 1 diabetes mellitus (DM) in patients already in chronic good glycaemic control with conventional insulins, 69 patients on intensive therapy (4 daily s.c. insulin injections, soluble at each meal, NPH at bedtime, HbA1c <7.5%) were studied with an open, cross-over design for two periods of 3 months each (lispro or soluble). The % HbA1c and frequency of hypoglycaemia were assessed under four different conditions (Groups I-IV). Lispro was always injected at mealtime, soluble 10-40 min prior to meals (with the exception of Group IV). Bedtime NPH was continued with both treatments. When lispro replaced soluble with no increase in number of daily NPH injections (Group I, n = 15), HbA1c was no different (p = NS), but frequency of hypoglycaemia was greater (p < 0.05). When NPH was given 3-4 times daily, lispro (Group II, n = 18), but not soluble (Group III, n = 12) decreased HbA1c by 0.35 +/- 0.25% with no increase in hypoglycaemia. When soluble was injected at mealtimes, HbA1c increased by 0.18 +/- 0.15% and hypoglycaemia was more frequent than when soluble was injected 10-40 min prior to meals (Group IV, n = 24) (p < 0.05). It is concluded that in intensive management of Type 1 DM, lispro is superior to soluble in terms of reduction of % HbA1c and frequency of hypoglycaemia, especially for those patients who do not use a time interval between insulin injection and meal. However, these goals cannot be achieved without optimization of basal insulin.'\n 'The aim of the study was to compare lispro (LP) and Insuman(R) (I) insulin in continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) therapy with respect to blood glucose control as expressed by the standard deviation of blood glucose (SD(BG) ) and HbA(1c) and to monitor the well-being (WBQ) and treatment satisfaction (DTSQ) parameters during such treatment. Forty-one IDDM patients who had used CSII for at least 6 months participated in an open-label, randomized, cross-over, multicenter study for 4 months (2 months LP and 2 months I or vice versa). Boluses with LP were given 5 min before each meal and with I 30 min before each meal. During LP administration compared with I, the SD(BG) of all blood glucose values (3.6 mmol/l vs. 3.9 mmol/l, p=0.012), as well as the SD(BG) of the postprandial, blood glucose values (3.6 mmol/l vs. 4.0 mmol/l, p=0.006), were significantly reduced. The HbA(1c) was significantly lower during LP administration (7.4% vs. 7.6%, p=0.047). The incidence of hypoglycemic events per 30 days (capillary blood glucose<3.0 mmol/l and/or symptoms) did not significantly differ between LP and I (9.7 vs. 8.0 per month, p=0.23). The total amount of daily insulin was slightly but significantly lower with LP, compared to I (38.0 IU vs. 40.3 IU, p=0.004). There was no treatment effects of LP compared to I concerning WBQ and DTSQ. It is concluded that in CSII therapy LP is superior to I with respect to the stability of blood glucose control, a lower HbA(1c), a less insulin requirement without increasing the frequency of hypoglycemia.'\n 'To compare the immunologic response to insulin lispro with that to regular human insulin, thereby assuring its safety for use in women with gestational diabetes, and to verify that it is effective.\\n                We compared the metabolic and immunologic effects of insulin lispro and regular human insulin in 42 women >18 years of age diagnosed with gestational diabetes by oral glucose tolerance testing at 14-32 weeks of gestation. Patients were randomized to receive regular human insulin or insulin lispro before consuming a test meal. Serum insulin, blood glucose, and C-peptide concentrations were measured. Throughout the remainder of gestation, patients received premeal insulin lispro or regular human insulin combined with basal insulin and performed blood glucose self-monitoring before and after each meal. Insulin antibodies and HbA1c were determined at enrollment and 6 weeks later. In addition, 10 patients received continuous intravenous insulin (4 lispro, 6 regular human insulin) and dextrose infusions intrapartum to assess placental insulin transfer.\\n                Anti-insulin antibody levels were similar in the two groups. Insulin lispro was not detectable in the cord blood. During a meal test, areas under the curve for glucose, insulin, and C-peptide were significantly lower in the lispro group. Mean fasting and postprandial glucose concentrations and end point HbA1c were similar in the two groups. The lispro group demonstrated fewer hypoglycemic episodes (symptoms and blood glucose concentrations <55 mg/dl). No fetal or neonatal abnormalities were noted in either treatment group.\\n                Insulin lispro may be considered a treatment option for women with gestational diabetes.'\n 'To quantitate the contribution of postprandial blood glucose, which improves with the short-acting insulin analog lispro [Lys(B28),Pro(B29)] in type 1 diabetes, to the overall 24-h blood glucose concentration and the long-term HbA1c concentration under conditions of different postabsorptive blood glucose.\\n                A total of 24 type 1 diabetic patients on long-term intensive therapy with premeal human regular insulin (Hum-R) and bedtime NPH were randomly assigned to a continuation of Hum-R (group 1, n = 8), lispro (group 2, n = 8), or lispro + NPH (in variable proportions) administered at mealtime (group 3, n = 8) for 3 months, NPH administered at bedtime was continued in all three groups. Data from home blood glucose monitoring were collected, and a 24-h plasma glucose and insulin profile was obtained during a 2-day hospital visit to calculate areas under the postprandial glucose curve (3.5 h after breakfast, 3.5 h after lunch, and 3.0 h after dinner for a total of 10.0 h) and the postabsorptive blood glucose curve (the remaining 14.0 h out of 24.0 h) (AUC). Eight nondiabetic subjects were also studied.\\n                The substitution of Hum-R with lispro (group 2) resulted in lower postprandial blood glucose, but greater postabsorptive blood glucose (P < 0.05 vs. group 1). The postprandial blood glucose AUC was lower (161 +/- 19 vs. 167 +/- 20 mg.100 ml-1.h-1), but the postabsorptive blood glucose AUC was greater (155 +/- 22 vs. 142 +/- 19 mg.100 ml-1.h-1) (P < 0.05). Therefore, the 24-h blood glucose AUC was no different (NS). Consequently, HbA1c was no different (NS). This occurred because in group 2, mealtime lispro resulted in normal prandial plasma insulin, but also resulted in lower interprandial concentration (P < 0.05 vs. group 1). When NPH was added to lispro (30% at breakfast, 40% at lunch, 10% at dinner) in group 3, postabsorptive plasma insulin was similar to group 1 (NS), in group 3, the postprandial blood glucose AUC (153 +/- 17 mg.100 ml-1.h-1) was lower and the postabsorptive blood glucose AUC was no different, as compared with group 1 (NS). Therefore, the 24-h blood glucose AUC was lower (147 +/- 17 vs. 155 +/- 21 and 158 +/- 20 mg.100 ml-1.h-1), and HbA1c was lower (6.41 +/- 0.12 vs. 6.84 +/- 0.2 and 6.96 +/- 0.2% (groups 3, 1, and 2 respectively, P < 0.05). Frequency of hypoglycemia was greater in group 2 (P < 0.05), but not in group 3 (NS) vs. group 1.'\n 'Insulin lispro is an insulin analog that was recently developed particularly for a mealtime therapy. It has a fast absorption rate and short duration of action. The efficacy of insulin lispro in the clinical therapy of patients with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) has not been tested.\\n                To compare insulin lispro and human regular insulin in the mealtime treatment of patients with NIDDM.\\n                A 6-month, randomized, multinational (16 countries), multicenter (80 sites) clinical trial with an open-label, crossover design was performed in 722 patients with NIDDM. Insulin lispro was injected immediately before and human regular insulin 30 to 45 minutes before the meal.\\n                Throughout the study, the postprandial rise in serum glucose levels was significantly lower during insulin lispro than human regular insulin treatment. At end point the rise (mean +/- SEM) in serum glucose levels was 30% lower at 1 hour (2.6 +/- 0.1 mmol/L [46.8 +/- 1.8 mg/ dL] for lispro vs 3.7 +/- 0.1 mmol/L [66.6 +/- 1.8 mg/dL] for human regular insulin) and 53% lower 2 hours after the test meal (1.4 +/- 0.1 mmol/L [25.2 +/- 1.8 mg/dL] for lispro vs 3.0 +/- 0.1 mmol/L [54.0 +/- 1.8 mg/dL] for human regular insulin) with insulin lispro compared with human regular insulin therapy (P < .001 for both intervals). During insulin lispro therapy the rate of hypoglycemia overall (P = .01) and overnight (P < .001) was lower and the number of asymptomatic hypoglycemic episodes was smaller (P = .03) than during human regular insulin therapy. Associated with a similar 13% increase (P < .001) in the total daily insulin dose, the glycosylated hemoglobin level decreased (P < .001) equally in both treatment groups. Serum lipid and lipoprotein levels remained unchanged. There were no differences in the adverse events between the 2 treatment groups.\\n                Compared with human regular insulin therapy, mealtime therapy with insulin lispro reduced postprandial hyperglycemia and may decrease the rate of mild hypoglycemic episodes in patients with NIDDM.'\n 'The absorption of regular human insulin from subcutaneous injection sites is delayed due to the self-association of insulin to multimeric forms. The insulin analogue insulin lispro has a weak self-association and a fast absorption rate. We examined the safety and efficacy of insulin lispro in the premeal treatment of patients with diabetes mellitus. A 12-month study was performed in 336 patients with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) and 295 patients with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM). The patients were randomized to inject either regular human insulin 30 to 45 minutes before eating, or insulin lispro immediately before each meal, in addition to basal insulin. The postprandial rise in serum glucose was lower in patients receiving insulin lispro than in those receiving regular human insulin therapy. At end point the increment was significantly lower at 1 hour (35%) and at 2 hours (64%) after the meal in IDDM patients; in NIDDM patients, the increment was nonsignificantly lower at 1 hour (19%) and significantly lower at 2 hours (48%). IDDM patients receiving insulin lispro achieved significantly lower glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) levels in patients receiving regular human insulin (8.1% vs 8.3%). In NIDDM patients, HbA1c levels decreased equally in both treatment groups. Due to its fast absorption rate, insulin lispro improves postprandial control in diabetes. Insulin lispro can be considered one step toward optimal insulin therapy and improved patient convenience.'\n 'Insulin lispro, an insulin analog recently developed particularly for mealtime therapy, has a fast absorption rate and a short duration of action. We compared insulin lispro and regular human insulin in the mealtime treatment of 1,008 patients with IDDM. The study was a 6-month randomized multinational (17 countries) and multicenter (102 investigators) clinical trial performed with an open-label crossover design. Insulin lispro was injected immediately before the meal, and regular human insulin was injected 30-45 min before the meal. Throughout the study, the postprandial rise in serum glucose was significantly lower during insulin lispro therapy. At the endpoint, the postprandial rise in serum glucose was reduced at 1 h by 1.3 mmol/l and at 2 h by 2.0 mmol/l in patients treated with insulin lispro (P < 0.001). The rate of hypoglycemia was 12% less with insulin lispro (6.4 +/- 0.2 vs. 7.2 +/- 0.3 episodes/30 days, P < 0.001), independent of basal insulin regimen or HbA1c level. The reduction was observed equally in episodes with and without symptoms. When the total number of episodes for each patient was analyzed according to the time of occurrence, the number of hypoglycemic episodes was less with insulin lispro than with regular human insulin therapy during three of four quarters of the day (P < 0.001). The largest relative improvement was observed at night. In conclusion, insulin lispro improves postprandial control, reduces hypoglycemic episodes, and improves patient convenience, compared with regular human insulin, in IDDM patients.'\n 'IGF-I levels in patients with type 1 diabetes without endogenous insulin production are low. Our aim was to examine whether the plasma insulin profile obtained by treatment with the insulin analogue lispro has a different effect on plasma concentrations of IGF-I and IGFBP-1 than that seen during treatment with conventional human insulin (regular insulin).\\n                Twelve patients with type 1 diabetes, age 47.8 +/- 2.4 years (mean +/- SEM), body mass index 26.5 +/- 1.0 kg/m2, diabetes duration 30.5 +/- 3.2 years participated in this open label randomized cross-over study. IGF-I and IGFBP-1 levels were measured at the end of 6 weeks treatment with each insulin being administered by a continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion. IGF-I was measured fasting while IGFBP-1, free insulin and blood glucose were measured fasting and repeatedly after a morning meal preceded by an insulin bolus dose.\\n                Lispro gave a marked insulin peak of 135 +/- 20 pmol/l 50 minutes after injection. After an initial rapid rise, human regular insulin reached a plateau of approximately 50 pmol/l. The plasma free insulin area under the curve (AUC) from 0710 h to 0910 h was more than twice as large on lispro as on regular insulin (P = 0.01). Plasma IGF-I concentration was 78.8 +/- 10.9 microg/l on lispro and 82.3 +/- 10.5 microg/l on human regular insulin (not significant). AUC for IGFBP-1 did not show a significant difference even when divided from 0710 h to 0910 h and from 0930 h to 1430 h. Blood glucose AUC after administration of the bolus was significantly lower during treatment with lispro (P = 0.006) but glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA1c) was 6.4 +/- 0.2% on both therapies.\\n                Our results indicate that the effect of lispro on IGF-I and IGFBP-1 in patients with type 1 diabetes does not differ from that of human regular insulin.'\n 'To compare health-related quality of life (HRQOL) in patients with diabetes receiving insulin lispro with patients receiving regular human insulin (Humulin R).\\n                We performed two randomized comparative studies over a 6-month period (3 months per treatment). Primary analyses used crossover baseline to 3-month changes in HRQOL scores. Ninety-three principal investigators in Canada, France, Germany, and the U.S. participated in these studies. One HRQOL crossover study included 468 patients with type I diabetes; the other HRQOL crossover study included 474 patients with type II diabetes. In both studies, patients were taking insulin at least 2 months before enrollment. Primary outcomes included two generic HRQOL domains, energy/fatigue and health distress, and two diabetes-specific domains, treatment satisfaction and treatment flexibility. Thirty secondary outcomes included both generic and diabetes-specific measures. Secondary outcome domains were controlled for multiplicity in the analyses.\\n                Primary analyses showed that treatment satisfaction scores (P < 0.001) and treatment flexibility scores (P = 0.001) were higher for insulin lispro in type I diabetic patients. No other significant treatment differences were detected using the data from these 6-month crossover studies.\\n                Treatment satisfaction and treatment flexibility were significantly improved in patients with type I diabetes using insulin lispro. Other HRQOL findings were comparable for insulin lispro and regular human insulin. Insulin lispro appears to have a measurable impact on lifestyle benefits in patients with type I diabetes, as demonstrated by increased treatment satisfaction and treatment flexibility.'\n 'To compare the efficacy and safety of premixed insulin aspart (30% free and 70% protamine-bound, BIAsp 30) with human insulin premix (BHI 30) used in a twice-daily injection regimen in people with Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes.\\n                People with Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes (n = 294) using twice-daily insulin were randomized to a 12-week open-label comparison of BIAsp 30 and BHI 30. Efficacy was assessed by analysis of variance of 12-week data, adjusted for baseline level.\\n                BIAsp 30 was as effective as BHI 30 based on the primary efficacy measure, HbA1c, mean difference -0.01 (90% confidence interval (CI) -0.14; 0.12) %Hb. Meal-time self-measured blood glucose increment averaged over the three main meals was significantly lower in the BIAsp 30 group than in the BHI 30 group (-0.68 (-1.20; -0.16) mmol/l; P < 0.02). Significant improvements were observed after breakfast, before lunch, after dinner and at bedtime (P < 0.02-0.05), with blood glucose around 1.0 mmol/l lower in the BIAsp 30 group. The number of major hypoglycaemic episodes with BIAsp 30 was half that with BHI 30. However, the overall risk of both minor and major hypoglycaemia did not differ significantly between treatments.\\n                Post-prandial glycaemic control was significantly improved, without increasing the risk of hypoglycaemia, and overall control was similar when people with Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes were treated on a twice-daily regimen with immediate premeal injections of BIAsp 30 compared with BHI 30.'\n 'A common treatment regimen for patients with either insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) or non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) is a combination of rapid-acting insulin and intermediate-acting insulin administered twice each day. It is usually recommended that regular human insulin be injected 30 to 45 minutes before a meal. In practice, patients often inject regular human insulin closer to mealtime, causing a higher post-prandial serum glucose level and an increased potential for hypoglycemia in the postabsorptive period. Insulin lispro, a rapid-acting insulin analogue, is best injected just before a meal because of its more rapid absorption and shorter duration of action. In 707 randomized patients, 379 with IDDM and 328 with NIDDM, we studied the effect of twice-daily insulin lispro or regular human insulin in combination with NPH human insulin (isophane insulin) on premeal, 2-hour postprandial, and bedtime glycemic control. Assessments were based on the results of a seven-point blood glucose profile, the insulin dose (by formulation and time of administration), the incidence and frequency of hypoglycemic episodes, and the glycated hemoglobin value. Treatment with insulin lispro resulted in lower postprandial glucose levels and smaller increases in glucose level after the morning and evening meals compared with treatment with regular human insulin. Overall glycemic control, frequency of hypoglycemic events, and total insulin dose were not different between the two groups. Insulin lispro in combination with NPH human insulin in a twice-per-day regimen allows injection closer to mealtime and improves post-prandial glycemic control without increasing the risk of hypoglycemia.'\n 'A variety of abnormalities of metabolic, haemostatic and endothelial markers are associated with Type 2 diabetes. Evidence suggests that poor post-prandial blood glucose control may contribute to vascular risk. We aimed to examine whether the restoration of a more physiological insulin profile post-prandially would improve these abnormalities. Twenty-one patients with insulin-treated Type 2 diabetes were recruited into a single centre, crossover, double-blind study. Patients were randomized to unmodified human insulin or insulin aspart before main meals for 6-week study periods, both together with NPH insulin. At the end of each study period, pre-breakfast levels of markers of vascular risk were assessed and a test meal performed. There was no significant difference in HbA(1c) (7.04 +/- 0.13% (+/-S.E.) versus 7.15 +/- 0.11%, P = 0.060) with insulin aspart compared to human insulin at the end of each study period. The mean post-prandial blood glucose concentration at 90 min from self-monitored results was lower with insulin aspart than with human insulin (7.9 +/- 0.4 mmol/l versus 9.3 +/- 0.4 mmol/l, P = 0.011) as was study day post-prandial blood glucose at 90 min (8.4 +/- 0.5 mmol/l versus 9.2 +/- 0.6 mmol/l, P = 0.046). No significant differences were found in fasting lipid profile, apolipoproteins, fibrinogen, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1, E-selectin, or homocysteine between the two study periods. Insulin aspart resulted in improved post-prandial glycaemic control when compared to human insulin in Type 2 diabetic patients, but this was not associated with changes in markers of vascular risk.'\n \"Insulin lispro is an analog of human insulin with a faster onset and a shorter duration of action than regular human insulin. Efficacy and tolerability of insulin lispro in continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) treatment were assessed in an open randomized crossover trial comparing insulin lispro and regular human insulin, both applied with insulin pumps.\\n                A total of 113 type 1 patients (60 male, 53 female, age [mean +/- SD] 37 +/- 12 years, duration of diabetes 19 +/- 9 years) participated in this open, randomized crossover study. Both insulins were applied for 4 months each with the appropriate intervals between the prandial insulin bolus and the meal (human insulin: 30 min; lispro: 0 min). Observation parameters were HbA1c, daily and postprandial blood glucose profiles, adverse events, rate of hypoglycemic and hyperglycemic events, number of catheter obstructions, and treatment satisfaction as assessed with an international validated questionnaire.\\n                The patients were well controlled with a mean HBA1c of 7.24 +/- 1.0% at baseline. HbA1c decreased in both treatment periods, but it was better during insulin lispro treatment (insulin lispro: 6.8 +/- 0.9%, regular human insulin: 6.9 +/- 1.0%, Friedman's rank-sum test: P < 0.02). In addition, the 1-h and 2-h postprandial rises in blood glucose were significantly lower (P < 0.001 for each meal) with insulin lispro, resulting in smoother daily glucose profiles as compared with regular human insulin. No significant differences were reported for the rate of hypoglycemia (mean +/- SD [median]: insulin lispro 12.4 +/- 13.9 [8], regular human insulin 11.0 +/- 11.2 [8]), for the rate of catheter obstructions (42 events in each treatment arm), and for the number and type of adverse events. No severe case of ketoacidosis was seen during insulin lispro treatment, whereas one case was reported during therapy with regular human insulin. Treatment satisfaction was better when patients were treated with insulin lispro.\\n                Insulin lispro is a suitable and very convenient pump insulin that may result in an improvement of long-term glucose control during CSII treatment. Its safety profile does not differ from that of regular human insulin.\"\n 'To compare the efficacy and safety of preprandial administration of rapid-acting lispro analogue with regular short-acting insulin to pregnant women with type 1 diabetes.\\n                Open randomised multicentre study. Women were treated with multiple insulin injections aiming at normoglycaemia. Blood glucose was determined six times daily, HbA(1c) every 4 weeks. Diurnal profiles of blood glucose were analysed at gestational week 14 and during the study period at weeks 21, 28 and 34.\\n                33 pregnant women with type 1 DM were randomised to treatment with lispro insulin (n=16) or regular insulin (n=17).\\n                Blood glucose was significantly lower (P<0.01) after breakfast in the lispro group, while there were no significant group differences in glycemic control during the rest of the day. Severe hypoglycaemia occurred in two patients in the regular group but biochemical hypoglycaemia (blood glucose <3.0 mmol/l) was more frequent in the lispro than in the regular group (5.5 vs. 3.9%, respectively). HbA(1c) values at inclusion were 6.5 and 6.6% in the lispro and regular group respectively. HbA(1c) values declined during the study period and were similar in both groups. There was no perinatal mortality. Complications during pregnancy, route of delivery and foetal outcome did not differ between the groups. Retinopathy progressed in both groups, one patient in the regular group developed proliferative retinopathy.\\n                The results suggest that it is possible to achieve at least as adequate glycemic control with lispro as with regular insulin therapy in type 1 diabetic pregnancies.'\n 'The objective of this study was to compare the efficacy of the rapid-acting Lys(B28), Pro(B29) human insulin analog, insulin lispro, with currently available short-acting human insulin in a multiple injection therapy (MIT) regimen with respect to blood glucose and plasma insulin profiles and to serum metabolites (lactate, free fatty acids, glycerol, and beta-hydroxybutyrate) in 12 well-controlled type 1 diabetic subjects (8 male, HbA1c 6.8 +/- 0.9% [mean +/- SD]).\\n                After a run-in period of 4 weeks, patients were treated with either lispro at mealtime or human insulin 30 min before the meal for two periods of 4 weeks in a randomized open-label crossover study. Intermediate-acting insulin (NPH insulin) was given at bedtime. At the end of both study periods, metabolic profiles were assessed from 10:00 P.M. to 7:00 P.M. the next day.\\n                During the treatment periods, glycemic control was stable during lispro but improved during human insulin (delta HbA1c lispro 0.1 +/- 0.48, NS; human insulin -0.41 +/- 0.34%, P < 0.05). Glucose excursions, as measured by the incremental AUC, during the day and for the 2-h postprandial periods, were lower, although not significantly, for lispro. Insulin profiles demonstrated a faster rise after administration of lispro as compared with human insulin, peaking at 61 +/- 11.9 and 111 +/- 48.1 min (P < 0.01). Glycerol levels showed a slight increase before lunch and dinner, suggestive of enhanced lipolytic activity and compatible with the lower insulin levels.\\n                Lispro insulin applied in an MIT regimen creates more physiologic insulin profiles and tends to lower the glycemic excursions during the day compared with short-acting insulin. The analog can be applied safely in an MIT regimen, with mealtime intervals up to 5 h.'\n 'nan'\n 'Lispro (LP) and regular human (HR) insulins were compared in Type 1 diabetic (T1DM) patients on either a Mediterranean diet or normal diet. Twelve T1DM patients were recruited and randomized into two groups of 6, groups A and B. They were treated in different sequences (in 3-month intervals for 1 year). Group A: LP insulin and normal diet, LP insulin and Mediterranean diet, regular insulin and Mediterranean diet, regular insulin and normal diet. Group B: regular insulin and normal diet, regular insulin and Mediterranean diet, LP insulin and Mediterranean diet, LP insulin and normal diet. Each patient was treated with rapid acting insulin, either LP insulin or HR insulin, before each main meal and a dose of slow acting insulin at bedtime. Every 15 days the glycemic control, the incidence and frequency of hypoglycemic episodes, and any adverse events were evaluated. Every 3 months, hematology and a chemistry panel, pre- and post-prandial glycemic and insulinemic profiles were evaluated in all patients. HbA1c levels significantly decreased in LP patients on normal diet, post-prandial glycemic levels were significantly lower in LP than in HR patients from 30 min onwards, 15-min post-prandial insulin levels higher in LP- than in HR-treated patients, and hypoglycemic episodes were significantly less in LP- than in HR-treated patients. LP insulin, irrespective of the type of diet, results in more effective glycemic control, significantly reduces hypoglycemic episodes as opposed to traditional insulin therapy and seems to be more effective with a normal diet than with a Mediterranean diet.'\n 'To compare the safety and efficacy of insulin aspart (IAsp), buffered regular insulin (BR), and insulin lispro administered by continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) in patients with type 1 diabetes.\\n                After completing a 4-week run-in period with BR, 146 adult patients with type 1 diabetes (with pretrial CSII experience) were randomly assigned (2:2:1) to CSII treatment with IAsp, BR, or lispro for 16 weeks in a multicenter, open-label, randomized, parallel-group study. Bolus insulin doses were administered 30 min before meals (BR) or immediately before meals (IAsp or lispro).\\n                Treatment groups had similar baseline HbA(1c) (7.3% +/- 0.7 for IAsp, 7.5% +/- 0.8 for BR, and 7.3% +/- 0.7 for lispro). After 16 weeks of treatment, HbA1c values were relatively unchanged from baseline, and the mean changes in baseline HbA1c values were not significantly different between the three groups (0.00 +/- 0.51, 0.15 +/- 0.63, and 0.18 +/- 0.84 for the IAsp, BR, and lispro groups, respectively). The rates of hypoglycemic episodes (blood glucose <50 mg/dl) per patient per month were similar (3.7, 4.8, and 4.4 for the IAsp, BR, and lispro groups, respectively). Clogs/blockages in pumps or infusion sets were infrequent; most subjects (76, 83, and 75% in the IAsp, BR, and lispro groups, respectively) had < or = 1 clog or blockage per 4 weeks during the trial.\\n                Insulin aspart in CSII was as efficacious and well tolerated as BR and lispro and is a suitable insulin for continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion using external pumps.'\n 'Despite considerable experience with insulin lispro, few blinded comparisons with soluble insulin are available. This study compared insulin lispro with human soluble insulin in patients with Type 1 diabetes mellitus on multiple injection therapy who inject shortly before meals.\\n                Glucose control, frequency of hypoglycaemia and patient preference were examined in the course of a prospective, randomized, double-blind, crossover comparison, with a 6-week run-in period and 12 weeks on each therapy. Ninety-three patients took part, all on multiple daily doses of insulin, with soluble insulin before meals and NPH (isophane) insulin at night. The main outcome measures were self-monitored blood glucose profiles, glycated haemoglobin, frequency of hypoglycaemic episodes, patient satisfaction and well-being and patient preference.\\n                Blood glucose levels were significantly lower after breakfast and lunch, but higher before breakfast, lunch and supper, in patients taking insulin lispro. Levels of HbA(1c) were 7.4 +/- 1.1% on Humulin S and 7.5 +/- 1.1% on insulin lispro (P = 0.807). The overall frequency of symptomatic hypoglycaemia did not differ, but patients on insulin lispro were less likely to experience hypoglycaemia between midnight and 6 a.m., and more likely to experience episodes from 6 a.m. to midday. Questionnaires completed by 84/87 patients at the end of the study showed that 43 (51%) were able to identify each insulin correctly, nine (11%) were incorrect, and 32 (38%) were unable to tell the insulins apart. No significant preference emerged: 35 (42%) opted for insulin lispro, 24 (29%) opted for Humulin S, while the remainder had no clear preference.\\n                Substitution of insulin lispro for soluble insulin in a multiple injection regimen improved post-prandial glucose control at the expense of an increase in fasting and pre-prandial glucose levels. Patients who already injected shortly before meals expressed no clear preference for the fast-acting analogue, and did not improve their overall control as a result of using it. Nocturnal hypoglycaemia was however, less frequent on insulin lispro, and may emerge as a robust indication for its use.'\n 'To compare the effects of Humalog Mix25 (Humalog Mix75/25 in the USA) (Mix25) and human insulin 30/70 (30/70) on the 24-hour inpatient plasma glucose (PG) profile in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM).\\n                A randomised, open-label, 8-week crossover study. Study insulins were injected twice daily, 5 minutes before breakfast and dinner.\\n                Four-week outpatient (dose-adjustment) treatment phase, and 3-day inpatient (test) phase.\\n                Twenty-five insulin-treated patients with T2DM (ages 40-66 years), mean (+/- standard error of the mean) (SEM) HbA1c 7.7% +/- 0.23%, and body mass index (BMI) 29.3 +/- 0.83 kg/m2.\\n                24-hour PG profiles, PG excursions after meals, PG area under the curve (AUC), and 30-day hypoglycaemia rate.\\n                The 2-hour PG excursions following breakfast (5.5 +/- 0.34 v. 7.2 +/- 0.34 mmol/l, p = 0.002) and dinner (2.4 +/- 0.27 v. 3.4 +/- 0.27 mmol/l, p = 0.018) were smaller with Mix25 than with 30/70. PG AUC between breakfast and lunch was smaller with Mix25 than with 30/70 (77.6 +/- 3.8 v. 89.5 +/- 4.3 mmol/h/ml, p = 0.001). PG AUC between lunch and dinner, dinner and bedtime, and bedtime and breakfast did not differ between treatments. Pre-meal and nocturnal PG were comparable. The postprandial insulin requirement for lunch meals was supplied equally by the two insulin treatments. The thirty-day hypoglycaemia rate was low (Mix25 0.049 +/- 0.018 v. 30/70 0.100 +/- 0.018 episodes/patient/30 days, p = 0.586) for both treatments.\\n                In patients with T2DM, Mix25 improved the 24-hour PG profile with lower postprandial PG excursions than with human insulin 30/70.'\n 'Insulin lispro is a human insulin analog that dissociates more rapidly than human regular insulin after subcutaneous injection, resulting in higher insulin levels at an earlier point in time and a shorter duration of action. The aim of the study was to evaluate if this pharmacokinetic difference would translate into better postprandial and overall control in 30 IDDM patients (age, 35.1 +/- 1.5 years; male-female ratio, 17:13; BMI, 24.8 +/- 0.5 kg/m2; HbA1c, 8.03 +/- 0.13% at baseline) treated with continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII; Disetronic H-TRON V100) in a double-blind crossover clinical study. Patients were randomized to insulin lispro or human regular insulin for 3 months before crossing over to the other insulin for another 3 months. All meal boluses were given immediately before breakfast, lunch, and supper. An eight-point blood glucose profile was measured once weekly, and HbA1c levels were measured monthly. At the end of the 3-month treatment period, HbA1c levels were significantly lower with insulin lispro, compared with human regular insulin: 7.66 +/- 0.13 vs. 8.00 +/- 0.16% (P = 0.0041). While preprandial, bedtime, and 2:00 A.M. values for blood glucose were not significantly different, 1-h postprandial blood glucose was significantly improved after breakfast, lunch, and dinner with insulin lispro, compared with human regular insulin: 8.35 vs. 9.79 mmol/l (P = 0.006), 7.58 vs. 8.74 mmol/l (P = 0.049), and 7.85 vs. 9.01 mmol/l (P = 0.03). The incidence of hypoglycemia per 30 days (blood glucose levels, <3.0 mmol/l) was 8.4 +/- 1.3 before randomization, decreasing to 6.0 +/- 0.9 for insulin lispro and to 7.6 +/- 1.3 for regular insulin during the last month of the study. Two patients in each group reported insulin precipitation. We conclude that insulin lispro improves glycemic control in CSII without increasing the risk of hypoglycemia.'\n 'To compare glycemic control obtained with the new rapid-acting insulin analog insulin aspart with that obtained with unmodified human insulin using algorithm-driven dosage adjustment.\\n                This was a multicenter randomized double-blind crossover study of 90 male subjects with type 1 diabetes. Insulin aspart or soluble human insulin was administered before meals, and NPH insulin was administered at bedtime as basal therapy. Each 4-week study period ended with a 24-h inpatient serum insulin and plasma glucose profile.\\n                The 24-h plasma glucose control obtained with insulin aspart, as assessed by excursions of blood glucose outside a predefined normal range (4.0-7.0 mmo/l), was superior (22% reduction in excursion, P < 0.01). Fructosamine levels remained unchanged with insulin aspart, with daytime glycemic control superior but nighttime glycemic control inferior. Eight-point home blood glucose profiles confirmed that insulin aspart significantly improved postprandial blood glucose control after lunch and dinner (P < 0.05) without deterioration of preprandial blood glucose control. Hypoglycemic episodes requiring third-party intervention were significantly fewer with insulin aspart than with human insulin (20 vs. 44 events, P < 0.002). Insulin aspart was well tolerated.\\n                In comparison with human insulin, insulin aspart can improve postprandial glycemic control as assessed by a reduction in hyper- and hypoglycemic excursions in people with type 1 diabetes. For its full potential to be realized, it will need to provide better control of nighttime hyperglycemia.'\n 'To study whether post-prandial insulin lispro (PL) could be used as a part of insulin therapy instead of premeal human regular insulin (HR) in prepubertal children with Type 1 diabetes mellitus (Type 1 DM).\\n                In this open, randomized cross-over study patients used either PL or HR at breakfast and at dinner. After a 1-month screening period, patients were randomized to treatment with PL or HR for 3 months and then they crossed over to the other insulin for an additional 3 months. The patients were 24 prepubertal children with Type 1 DM (median age 6.2 years, duration of diabetes 37 months). Home monitoring of 1-day glucose profiles at meals (premeal, 1 h and 2 h after breakfast and after dinner) and HbA1c were measured before randomization, before cross-over, and at the last visit. Data on hypoglycaemic episodes were collected at each of the seven visits. The variables were compared between the two treatments.\\n                Of the patients 22/24 completed the study. There were no major differences in the glucose excursions between PL and HR after breakfast (mean +/- SD: 1-h PL 3.7 +/- 4.7 vs. HR 2.9 +/- 3.9 mmol/l, P = 0.3; 2-h -0.9 +/- 5.4 vs. 0.3 +/- 4.5 mmol/l, P = 0.2, respectively) or after dinner (1-h PL -2.5 +/- 4.8 vs. HR -0.4 +/- 3.7 mmol/l, P = 0.07, 2-h -4.1 +/- 5.2 vs. -0.7 +/- 5.0 mmol/l, P = 0.05, respectively). Mean change of HbA1c was similar in both treatment groups (PL 0.2 +/- 0.8% vs. HR -0.4 +/- 0.7%, P = 0.1). The frequency of hypoglycaemic episodes was 4.9 per patient per month during treatment with PL, and 4.4 during HR (P = 0.3).\\n                Treatment with post-prandial lispro as a meal insulin is as effective and safe as traditional treatment with regular insulin in young children.'\n 'To compare the plasma glucose (PG) response with a fixed mixture of 25% insulin lispro and 75% NPL (Mix25), prior to a meal and 3 h before exercise, to human insulin 30/70 (30/70) in patients with type 2 diabetes.\\n                Thirty-seven patients were treated in a randomized, open-label, 8-week, two-period crossover study. Mix25 was injected 5 min before breakfast and dinner throughout the study, as was 30/70 on inpatient test days and on outpatient dose titration days. Following the 4-week outpatient phase, patients were hospitalized, and exercised at a heart rate of 120 beats/min on a cycle ergometer two times for 30 min, separated by 30 min rest, starting 3 h after a 339 kcal breakfast.\\n                The 2-h postprandial PG was significantly lower with Mix25 ((mean +/- SEM) 10.5 +/- 0.4 mmol/l vs 11.6 +/- 0.4 mmol/l; p = 0.016). Maximum decrease in PG from onset of exercise to end of exercise was significantly less with Mix25 (-3.6 +/- 0.29 mmol/l vs -4.7 +/- 0.31 mmol/l; p = 0.001). The maximum decrease in PG over 6 h, after exercise onset, was significantly less with Mix25 (-4.3 +/- 0.4 mmol/l vs -5.9 +/- 0.4 mmol/l; p < 0.001). The frequency of hypoglycemia (blood glucose (BG) < 3 mmol/l or symptoms) during the inpatient test was not different between treatments. During the outpatient phase, the frequency of patient-recorded hypoglycemia was significantly lower with Mix25 (0.7 +/- 0.2 episodes/30 d vs 1.2 +/- 0.3 episodes/30 d; p = 0.042).\\n                Mix25 resulted in better postprandial PG control without an increase in exercise-induced hypoglycemia. The smaller decrease in PG during the postprandial phase after exercise may suggest a lower risk of exercise-induced hypoglycemia with Mix25 than with human insulin 30/70, especially for patients in tight glycemic control.'\n \"To compare quality of life (QoL) and treatment satisfaction in patients with Type 1 diabetes receiving the rapid-acting insulin analogue, insulin aspart (IAsp), with that in patients receiving soluble human insulin (HI).\\n                In this 6-month, multinational, randomized, open-label trial, 424 patients from German-speaking countries were subjected to psychometric assessment before and after randomization (ratio 2 : 1) to basal-bolus treatment with either IAsp (n = 283) or HI (n = 141). Patients on HI were advised to keep an injection-meal interval of 30 min, whereas patients on IAsp were advised to inject immediately before meals. Treatment satisfaction and diabetes-related QoL were assessed using validated instruments to measure the domains of patients' individual treatment goals, physical complaints, worries about the future, social relations, leisure time flexibility, daily hassles, diet restrictions, burdens and fear of hypoglycaemia, blood glucose fluctuations, self-efficacy, and fear of insulin analogues.\\n                After 6 months, IAsp was associated with significantly greater improvement in treatment satisfaction than HI in two different scales (P < 0.01), and in QoL with respect to diet restrictions (P < 0.01). Improved satisfaction was mainly due to increased dietary and leisure time flexibility (P < 0.0001). Twenty-three percent of the IAsp group vs. 14% of the HI group achieved small but important improvements of total QoL (between-group difference, P < 0.06). The number needed to treat (NNT) with IAsp for an important increase in QoL was calculated to be 10. Regression analyses of potential predictors of improvement in QoL highlighted patients intensely striving for physical strength (P < 0.01; NNT = 7) and patients feeling less protected against hypoglycaemia (P < 0.005; NNT = 8) as being the most likely to benefit from IAsp.\\n                Under these study conditions, IAsp improved treatment satisfaction and quality of life regarding diet restrictions when compared with human insulin. The 'numbers needed to treat' for important quality of life benefits indicate that the effect of IAsp in this regard is not trivial.\"\n 'The short-acting insulin analogue lispro ([LYS(B28), PRO(B29)] is absorbed from the subcutis more rapidly than soluble insulin (S). To compare the clinical effectiveness of lispro vs S, 11 Type 1 patients using continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) therapy (6 F, 5 M, age 30 +/- 2.5 years, diabetes duration 14 +/- 1.0 years, BMI 24.0 +/- 0.8 kg m(-2), HbA1c 6.5 +/- 0.2%) were studied in an open, randomized, crossover study for 6 months (3 months lispro and 3 months S or vice versa). During lispro treatment mean fasting and 2 h postprandial blood glucose were lower compared to the S phase (fasting 6.5 +/- 0.4 vs 7.5 +/- 0.4 mmol l(-1) (NS), postprandial 6.8 +/- 0.3 vs 8.3 +/- 0.3 mmol l(-1), p = 0.03). In patients treated first with lispro HbA1c levels improved from 6.3 +/- 0.2% to 5.7 +/- 0.3%; On reversion to S HbA1c increased to 6.2 +/- 0.2%. In the group treated first with S, HbA1c fell (6.7 +/- 0.4% vs 6.5 +/- 0.3%) and then improved further to 6.3 +/- 0.3% with lispro. None of these changes were significant. There was no significant difference with respect to hypoglycaemic or other adverse events. It can be concluded that lispro in CSII therapy is safe and may improve postprandial glucose excursions.'\n 'This study compared the glucose-lowering effect of insulin lispro, given before or after meals, with regular human insulin given before meals in prepubertal children with diabetes.\\n                A 3-way crossover, open-label study involving 61 prepubertal children (ages 2.9-11.4 years) with type 1 diabetes. The children were randomly assigned to receive regular human insulin 30 to 45 minutes before meals, insulin lispro within 15 minutes before or immediately after meals, combined with basal insulin. Each treatment lasted 3 months. Hemoglobin A(1c) levels and home glucose monitoring profiles were measured at the end of each treatment period.\\n                Treatment with insulin lispro before breakfast resulted in lower 2-hour postprandial glucose values than regular human insulin (11.7 +/- 4.4 mmol/L vs 15.0 +/- 5.4 mmol/L). Similarly, insulin lispro given before dinner resulted in lower blood glucose values 2 hours postprandially (8.8 +/- 5.0 mmol/L vs 10.8 +/- 5.4 mmol/L) than regular human insulin. When insulin lispro was administered after meals, the 2-hour glucose levels were between those seen with either insulin lispro or regular human insulin given before meals. The number and types of adverse events, the rates of hypoglycemia, and the HbA(1c) levels did not differ among the 3 therapies.\\n                In prepubertal children, insulin lispro given before meals is safe and significantly lowers postprandial glucose levels after breakfast and dinner compared with regular human insulin, and insulin lispro given after the meal provides similar benefits as regular human insulin before the meal.'\n 'Insulin lispro was compared with regular human insulin with respect to glycaemic control in patients with diabetes mellitus on intensive insulin treatment. Sixty-two patients (55 type 1; 7 type 2) from eight study centres in the Czech Republic, Slovenia and the Slovak Republic participated in a 4-month, open-label, randomized, crossover study. Patients administered insulin lispro immediately before meals or regular human insulin 30 min before meals. A test meal (220-400 kcal), based on local and individual dietary habits and consistent for each patient throughout the study was given at baseline and at the end of each treatment. At each test meal visit HbA1c, fasting blood glucose, 1-hour and 2-hour postprandial blood glucose levels were measured. The level of HbA1c (7.6% +/- 1.5% versus 7.4% +/- 1.5%), incidence of hypoglycaemia (41-66% of patients--versus 39-63%) and daily insulin dose (0.67 +/- 0.11 U/kg versus 0.65 +/- 0.11 U/kg) did not differ between treatment groups at endpoint (insulin lispro versus regular human insulin, respectively). Mean 2-hour postprandial blood glucose excursion for the insulin lispro group (0.0 +/- 3.7 mmol/L) was significantly lower (p = 0.035) when compared with the regular human insulin group (1.3 +/- 3.7 mmol/L) at endpoint. Therapy with insulin lispro was therefore associated with a significant improvement in postprandial blood glucose excursion control when compared with regular human insulin, without an increase in rate of hypoglycaemia.'\n 'To compare the efficacy of insulin aspart, a rapid-acting insulin analogue, with that of unmodified human insulin on long-term blood glucose control in Type 1 diabetes mellitus.\\n                Prospective, multi-centre, randomized, open-labelled, parallel-group trial lasting 6 months in 88 centres in eight European countries and including 1,070 adult subjects with Type 1 diabetes. Study patients were randomized 2:1 to insulin aspart or unmodified human insulin before main meals, with NPH-insulin as basal insulin. Main outcome measures were blood glucose control as assessed by HbA1c, eight-point self-monitored blood glucose profiles, insulin dose, quality of life, hypoglycaemia, and adverse events.\\n                After 6 months, insulin aspart was superior to human insulin with respect to HbA1c with a baseline-adjusted difference in HbA1c of 0.12 (95% confidence interval 0.03-0.22) %Hb, P < 0.02. Eight-point blood glucose profiles showed lower post-prandial glucose levels (mean baseline-adjusted -0.6 to -1.2 mmol/l, P < 0.01) after all main meals, but higher pre-prandial glucose levels before breakfast and dinner (0.7-0.8 mmol/l, P < 0.01) with insulin aspart. Satisfaction with treatment was significantly better in patients treated with insulin aspart (WHO Diabetes Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire (DTSQ) baseline-adjusted difference 2.3 (1.2-3.3) points, P < 0.001). The relative risk of experiencing a major hypoglycaemic episode with insulin aspart compared to human insulin was 0.83 (0.59-1.18, NS). Major night hypoglycaemic events requiring parenteral treatment were less with insulin aspart (1.3 vs. 3.4% of patients, P < 0.05), as were late post-prandial (4-6 h) events (1.8 vs. 5.0% of patients, P < 0.005).\\n                These results show small but useful advantage for the rapid-acting insulin analogue insulin aspart as a tool to improve long-term blood glucose control, hypoglycaemia, and quality of life, in people with Type 1 diabetes mellitus.'\n 'To compare the effects of insulin lispro (LP) and human regular insulin (HR) when given twice daily with NPH insulin on glycemic control (HbA1c), daily blood glucose profiles and rates of hypoglycemia in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus after failure to respond to sulfonylurea drugs.\\n                A 5.5-month randomized, open-label, parallel study of 148 patients receiving either LP (n = 70) or HR (n = 78). Eight-point blood glucose profiles and HbA1c measurements were collected at baseline, 1.5, 3.5 and 5.5 months.\\n                Two-hour post-breakfast and 2-hour post-supper blood glucose levels (means [and standard errors]) were significantly lower for LP than for HR at the end point (9.5 [0.4] mmol/L v. 10.9 [0.4] mmol/L and 8.4 [0.4] mmol/L v. 9.7 [0.4] mmol/L, respectively, p = 0.02 in both cases). HbA1c improved from 10.5% (0.2%) (LP) and 10.3% (0.2%) (HR) to 8.0% (0.1%). Hypoglycemia rates were similar during the day; however, there was an overnight trend to reduced rates with LP (0.08 [0.03] episodes/30 d v. 0.16 [0.04] episodes/30 d, p = 0.057). Quality-of life assessment showed significant improvement (p < 0.05) in the diabetes-related worry scale for LP subjects whereas HR subjects slightly worsened.\\n                With traditional twice-daily insulin administration algorithms, LP improves 2-hour postprandial glucose levels, quality of life and overnight hypoglycemia rates while delivering an equivalent level of glycemic control (HbA1c) compared with HR to insulin-naÃ¯ve patients with type 2 diabetes who require insulin.'\n \"To compare the safety, efficacy and management of insulin lispro (LP) with regular human insulin (RH) in young diabetic children treated with continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII).\\n                27 very young diabetic children (age 4.6 +/- 2.2 years) treated with CSII participated in an open-label, randomized cross-over multicenter study comparing 2 periods of 16 weeks of CSII with LP or RH.\\n                Mean daily basal rate was significantly higher during the LP period (p = 0.04). No differences were seen in changes in HbA1c levels, number of hypoglycemic events, cutaneous infections and catheter occlusions. There was no significant difference between the two treatments for preprandial and postprandial glucose values, although prandial glucose excursions tended to be lower with LP (significant at dinner, p = 0.01). Mean blood glucose levels were significantly higher at 0.00 and 3.00 a.m. during LP therapy (p < 0.05). No episode of ketoacidosis occurred during LP treatment. More parents indicated that LP made their own and the child's daily life easier (p = 0.02) and preferred LP (p = 0.01).\\n                LP in CSII therapy in children is safe, as effective as RH, improved postprandial excursions, met the needs of young children in their daily life well, and gained their parents' satisfaction and preference. However, a shorter duration of LP resulted in hyperglycemia during the first part of the night, which must be compensated for by increasing nocturnal basal rates during this time.\"\n 'While lispro insulin has been reported to lower postprandial blood glucose concentrations, less consistent effects have been shown for glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) levels. Aim of this study was to determine whether pre-meal association of NPH, an intermediate-acting insulin, with lispro improves overall glycemic control in type 1 diabetic patients.\\n                Eighty-five type 1 diabetic patients were studied in a multicenter randomized comparative (human regular vs lispro insulin) crossover (3-month) study in which NPH insulin was given as a dinner or bedtime injection and at breakfast and lunch if necessary. The number of injections was kept constant: 42% and 58% of patients injected insulin 3 and 4 times per day, respectively. Fasting and preprandial blood glucose levels were similar, while postprandial levels improved after lispro compared to human regular insulin (breakfast: 8.28 +/- 2.39 vs 9.28 +/- 2.72 mmol/l; lunch: 8.33 +/- 2.67 vs 9.06 +/- 2.67 mmol/l, dinner: 8.06 +/- 2.72 vs 9.28 +/- 2.44 mmol/l, ANOVA: p = 0.003). HbA1c also improved after lispro: 8.1 +/- 0.9 vs 8.3 +/- 0.8%, p < 0.05. The rate of hypoglycemia was similar. Patients showed better acceptance of lispro treatment (p < 0.001).\\n                Lispro improves overall blood glucose control in type 1 diabetic patients without increasing the incidence of hypoglycemia. This can be achieved by an optimal combination of lispro insulin with NPH whenever the time intervals between meals are too long.'\n \"To compare maternal glucose levels and neonatal outcome, achieved in women with gestational diabetes (GDM) receiving either regular insulin or insulin lispro, with those of a control group of non-diabetic pregnant women.\\n                We enrolled 49 pregnant women with GDM, randomly allocated to the treatment with either insulin lispro (n=25) or regular insulin (n=24), and 50 pregnant women with normal GCT, matched for age, parity, pre-pregnancy weight and BMI, who formed the control group. All the women were caucasian, non-obese, with a singleton pregnancy and delivered term live born infants. Women of both groups were requested to perform a blood glucose profile (consisting of nine determinations: fasting/pre-prandial, 1 and 2h post-prandial) every week from the time of diagnosis to 38 weeks (study subgroups) or every 2 weeks from 28 to 38 weeks' gestation (control group).\\n                Overall pre-prandial blood glucose values in diabetic women were significantly higher than those of controls; at the 1h post-prandial time point, blood glucose values of GDM women receiving insulin lispro were similar to those of controls, whereas in the regular group they were significantly higher. Overall, both the lispro and regular insulin obtained optimal metabolic control at the 2h post-prandial time point, although near-normal blood glucose levels 2h after lunch could be observed only in the lispro group. There were no statistically significant differences between the groups in neonatal outcome and anthropometric characteristics; however, the rate of infants with a cranial-thoracic circumference (CC/CT) ratio between the 10th and the 25th percentile was significantly higher in the group treated with regular insulin in comparison to the lispro and control groups.\\n                Fasting/pre-prandial and 1h post-prandial maternal blood glucose levels in non-diabetic pregnant women fell well below the currently accepted criteria of glycemic normality in diabetic pregnancies. In women with GDM, the use of insulin lispro enabled the attainment of near-normal glucose levels at the 1h post-prandial time point and was associated with normal anthropometric characteristics; the use of regular insulin was not able to blunt the 1h peak post-prandial response to a near-normal extent and resulted in infants with a tendency toward the disproportionate growth. Insulin lispro can be regarded as a valuable option for the treatment of gestational diabetes.\"\n 'It has been found that non-fasting plasma glucose is a better marker of diabetic control than fasting plasma glucose in type 2 diabetes. The main aim of treatment of type 2 diabetic patients is to control plasma glucose and HbA1c levels. In this study, we aimed to assess the effects of three different insulin regimens (group I: lispro insulin + NPH insulin, group II: lispro insulin + metformin and group III: regular insulin + NPH insulin) on overall glycaemic control and metabolic parameters in type 2 diabetic patients with secondary oral anti-diabetic drug failure.\\n                Sixty type 2 diabetic patients with secondary OAD failure were randomly allocated into three different treatment groups equally. There were no significant differences between groups concerning age, body mass index, diabetes duration, HbA1c and serum lipid levels at the beginning of the study. During the 6-month treatment period, blood glucose levels were determined 10 times during 24 h at pre-meal, post-prandial 1 and 2 h and at bedtime.\\n                Group I was found to be the most effective treatment regimen in controlling HbA1c levels (group I vs. group II, p = 0.013; group I vs. group III, p = 0.001; group II vs. group III, p > 0.05). When the comparison was made in each group, change in HbA1c was statistically significant for all groups (-3.18%, p = 0.001; -2.02%, p = 0.043 and -2.66%, p = 0.008 respectively). Group I was found to be more effective in controlling fasting and post-prandial plasma glucose levels measured at all times during the day when compared with group II and group III. In group II triglyceride levels were found to be significantly reduced, whereas other groups had no effect on lipids. No serious hypoglycaemic episodes were observed in any of the cases, whereas in group I hypoglycaemic episode rates were increased (chi2 = 8.843, p = 0.012).\\n                Lispro insulin plus NPH insulin regimen is more effective in controlling both pre- and post-prandial glucose levels and HbA1c when compared to regular insulin plus NPH insulin combination. Mealtime lispro insulin plus metformin combination therapy should also be seriously considered as an effective and alternative treatment regimen. It is worthy of attention that insulin lispro plus metformin lowered triglyceride levels.'\n 'Because there are limited data on the comparison of insulin aspart and mixed insulin in type 2 diabetes, this trial was performed to compare the efficacy and safety of preprandial insulin aspart with human soluble insulin (HI) and human premix (70% NPH/30% regular) insulin (MIX).\\n                A total of 231 type 2 diabetic patients were randomized to insulin aspart (n = 75), HI (n = 80), or MIX (n = 76) for 3 months. Insulin aspart and HI were administered with or without bedtime NPH insulin. A total of 204 patients completed the trial according to protocol. HbA1c, 7-point blood glucose, insulin dosage, and hypoglycemic episodes were recorded. The primary end point was \"change of HbA1c\" from baseline to last visit. Analysis for equivalence was performed by t tests with three subtests.\\n                HbA1c decreased 0.91 +/- 1.00 for insulin aspart, 0.73 +/- 0.87 for HI, and 0.65 +/- 1.10 for MIX with the following confidence intervals: insulin aspart HI (-0.21 to 0.57, P = 0.025), insulin aspart MIX (-0.17 to 0.69, P = 0.092), and HI-MIX (-0.33 to 0.48, P = 0.006). Postprandial blood glucose decreased in the insulin aspart group: 0.44 mmol/l to >1.67 mmol/l compared with HI and 1.1 mmol/l to >1.67 mmol/l compared with MIX. Preprandial insulin doses were similar in the insulin aspart and HI groups (10-14.5 U). Hypoglycemic events per month were 0.56 HI, 0.40 insulin aspart, and 0.19 MIX.\\n                Statistically, insulin aspart was not equivalent to another treatment in terms of HbA1c reduction. Insulin aspart treatment resulted in improved HbA1c and postprandial blood glucose. The application of insulin aspart was safe and well tolerated.'\n 'Several studies have suggested that use of the short-acting insulin analog, insulin lispro, in multiple injection therapy may reduce the risk of hypoglycemia in comparison with regular insulin. This effect might be more pronounced in well-controlled patients, since intensive treatment of IDDM increases the rate of severe hypoglycemic events. This study evaluated the effects of insulin lispro on glycemic control and hypoglycemia rates in well-controlled IDDM patients.\\n                This was an open, randomized, 6-month crossover study of 199 IDDM patients. Glycemic control was evaluated by HbA1c, home blood glucose measurements, and rate and timing of hypoglycemic events. At the end of the study, patients completed an evaluation form regarding therapy-related quality of life.\\n                HbA1c remained constant at approximately 7.3% throughout the study. Meal-related glucose excursions were significantly lower with insulin lispro compared with regular insulin (mean -0.8 +/- 1.7 vs. 1.1 +/- 1.6 mmol/l, P < 0.001), as was the within-day variability (M value 27.7 +/- 19.7 vs. 30.2 +/- 23.1, P = 0.007). The incidence of severe hypoglycemic events (58 vs. 36, P = 0.037) including coma (16 vs. 3, P = 0.004) was significantly lower with insulin lispro than with regular insulin. Patients felt that insulin lispro increased flexibility and freedom of lifestyle.\\n                In well-controlled IDDM patients, insulin lispro is associated with a lower risk of severe hypoglycemia and coma.']",
         "Our analysis suggests only a minor benefit of short acting insulin analogues in the majority of diabetic patients treated with insulin. Until long term efficacy and safety data are available we suggest a cautious response to the vigorous promotion of insulin analogues. For safety purposes, we need a long-term follow-up of large numbers of patients and well designed studies in pregnant women to determine the safety profile for both the mother and the unborn child."

         "[\"Lack of health insurance adversely affects children's health. Eight million US children are uninsured, with Latinos being the racial/ethnic group at greatest risk for being uninsured. A randomized, controlled trial comparing the effectiveness of various public insurance strategies for insuring uninsured children has never been conducted.\\n                To evaluate whether case managers are more effective than traditional methods in insuring uninsured Latino children.\\n                Randomized, controlled trial conducted from May 2002 to August 2004.\\n                A total of 275 uninsured Latino children and their parents were recruited from urban community sites in Boston.\\n                Uninsured children were assigned randomly to an intervention group with trained case managers or a control group that received traditional Medicaid and State Children's Health Insurance Program (SCHIP) outreach and enrollment. Case managers provided information on program eligibility, helped families complete insurance applications, acted as a family liaison with Medicaid/SCHIP, and assisted in maintaining coverage.\\n                Obtaining health insurance, coverage continuity, the time to obtain coverage, and parental satisfaction with the process of obtaining insurance for children were assessed. Subjects were contacted monthly for 1 year to monitor outcomes by a researcher blinded with respect to group assignment.\\n                One hundred thirty-nine subjects were assigned randomly to the intervention group and 136 to the control group. Intervention group children were significantly more likely to obtain health insurance (96% vs 57%) and had approximately 8 times the adjusted odds (odds ratio: 7.78; 95% confidence interval: 5.20-11.64) of obtaining insurance. Seventy-eight percent of intervention group children were insured continuously, compared with 30% of control group children. Intervention group children obtained insurance significantly faster (mean: 87.5 vs 134.8 days), and their parents were significantly more satisfied with the process of obtaining insurance.\\n                Community-based case managers are more effective than traditional Medicaid/SCHIP outreach and enrollment in insuring uninsured Latino children. Case management may be a useful mechanism to reduce the number of uninsured children, especially among high-risk populations.\"\n \"We evaluated emergency department (ED)-based outreach for the State Children's Health Insurance Program (SCHIP).\\n                We conducted a multicenter trial among uninsured children (< or = 18 years) who presented to 5 EDs in 2001 and 2002. On-site staff enrolled consecutive subjects for a control period followed by an intervention period during which staff handed out SCHIP applications to the uninsured. The primary outcome was state-level confirmation of insured status at 90 days.\\n                We followed 223 subjects (108 control, 115 intervention) by both phone interview and state records. Compared to control subjects, those receiving a SCHIP application were more likely to have state health insurance at 90 days (42% vs 28%; P<.05; odds ratio [OR]=3.8; 95% confidence interval [CI]=1.7, 8.6). Although the intervention effect was prominent among 118 African Americans (50% insured after intervention vs 31% of controls, P<.05), lack of family enrollment in other public assistance programs was the primary predictor of intervention success (OR=3.7; 95% CI=1.6, 8.4).\\n                Handing out insurance applications in the ED can be an effective SCHIP enrollment strategy, particularly among minority children without connections to the social welfare system. Adopted nationwide, this simple strategy could initiate insurance coverage for more than a quarter million additional children each year.\"]",
         "The two studies included in this review provide evidence that in the US providing health insurance information and application assistance, and handing out application materials in hospital emergency departments can probably both improve insurance coverage of children. Further studies evaluating the effectiveness of different outreach strategies for expanding health insurance coverage of children in different countries are needed, with careful attention given to study design."

A higher complication rate (31 of 40 vs. 13 of 33) (P less than 0.005) occurred in the group with the catheter tip at the third to fourth lumbar segment, as compared to those with the tip at the seventh to eighth thoracic segment, owing to more episodes of blanching and cyanosis of the extremities. There was no difference between groups in the rate of complications requiring catheter removal. Aortography revealed thrombosis in 21 of 23 patients studied, but there was no clinical evidence of impaired circulation. In retrospect, we found that, independently of catheter position, administration of antibiotics through the catheter was associated with an increased rate of complications (63 vs. 20 per cent). Umbilical-artery catheterization entails potential risks regardless of the position of the catheter; placement of the catheter with its tip at the seventh to eighth thoracic segment may be associated with fewer complications than at lower positions.'\n 'In order to determine if umbilical arterial catheter position affects the incidence of necrotizing enterocolitis, clinical outcome was analysed in 308 infants whose umbilical arterial catheter had been randomly allocated to a high (n = 162) or a low (n = 146) position. Necrotizing enterocolitis was classified as suspected or confirmed; all renal, lower limb and local catheter complications were also recorded. High umbilical arterial catheters were in place for longer than low catheters, provided more samples and were removed as an emergency less often. Lower limb blanching and cyanosis were more common with low catheters. Eleven cases of confirmed necrotizing enterocolitis occurred in the \"high\" group and nine in the \"low\" group. One case of fatal aortic thrombosis was encountered in the high group. Positioning umbilical arterial catheters in a high position allowed longer functional use and did not increase the incidence of necrotizing enterocolitis.'\n 'Seventy-one sick newborn infants, who had an umbilical artery catheterized, were randomized in one of four catheter groups: long end-hole-, short end-hole-, long side-hole- or short side-hole catheter. A long catheter means a high position of the catheter tip (Th6--11) and a short catheter a low position of the tip (L3--5). An angiography through the indwelling catheter in order to diagnose thrombosis was performed before the catheter was withdrawn. Dissection of the aorta and its brances was performed on infants who died. The total frequency of thromboses was 26%. There were no thromboses among infants with long end-hole catheters while infants with short end-hole catheters had thrombosis in 26%, long side-hole catheters in 33% and short side-hole catheters in 64%. Long end-hole catheters functioned better than the others. Only 6 of 16 infants with thrombosis had physical signs from the legs, while 12 infants without thrombosis had similar signs.'\n 'To determine whether there is a relationship between exposure to heparin and an increased risk of intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH), we analyzed data from a cohort of infants who had been subjects in a randomized clinical trial of umbilical artery catheter placement. Data from 862 infants who survived the first 6 days of life were used for analysis. The incidence of IVH (grades 1 through 4) was 28.6%. The mean (SD) birth weight for infants with IVH was 954 gm (247 gm) compared with 1053 gm (253 gm) among infants without IVH (p < 0.01). The mean (SD) heparin intake among infants with an IVH was 83.5 units/kg/day (48.7) compared with 59.4 units/kg/day (48.7) among infants without an IVH (p < 0.01). With the use of logistic regression modeling to adjust for a number of potentially confounding variables, including fluid intake and birth weight, we observed an odds ratio for an IVH of 1.96 (95% confidence interval = 1.32, 2.91) for infants with second through fourth quartile intakes of heparin compared with that for infants with first quartile heparin intakes. Although we cannot rule out the possibility that the observations from this model may be confounded by factors associated with the severity of illness of the infant, these data support the findings of previous reports of an association between heparin exposure and the risk for an IVH.']",

After providing baseline data by telephone interviews, they were randomly allocated to receive or not receive a family-directed program featuring mailed booklets and telephone contacts by health educators. Follow-up telephone interviews were conducted 3 and 12 months after program completion.\\n                The findings suggested that smoking onset was reduced by 16.4% at 1 year, with a 25.0% reduction for non-Hispanic Whites but no statistically significant program effect for other races/ethnicities. There were no statistically significant program effects for smokeless tobacco or alcohol use onset.\\n                The family-directed program was associated with reduced smoking onset for non-Hispanic Whites, suggesting that it is worthy of further application, development, and evaluation.\"\n 'This study evaluates the effects of a school-based smoking prevention program after 1 year, using school (22 middle/elementary schools, 15 high schools) as both the unit of randomization and the unit of analysis. The multigrade level (grades 6 through 9) intervention was designed to address comprehensively the social influence factors that encourage smoking. Teacher survey data indicated that treatment schools had a median of 10 classroom sessions devoted to tobacco/drug use education, 5 of which were the sessions designed for this evaluation, and control schools had also dedicated a median of 10 classroom sessions to tobacco/drug education. Thus, the study evaluated the incremental effects of the social influence intervention compared to \"standard-care\" curricula. Among those who reported smoking one or more cigarettes in the month prior to the intervention, there was a significant treatment effect on rate of smoking at one year, but no grade level, gender, or interaction effects. The 1-year covariate-adjusted smoking rate among pretest smokers in the treatment schools was 76.6 cigarettes per month, compared to 111.6 cigarettes per month in control schools, a 31.4% difference. These effects were not accounted for by differential subject attrition. The analyses for nonsmokers, however, showed no significant effects, and the program did not affect self-reported alcohol or marijuana use. Taken together with the results of other prevention studies, these results point to the need for the development and evaluation of new initiatives to prevent substance use.'\n 'This study tested a CD-ROM intervention with and without a parent involvement component to reduce risk of alcohol use among an urban sample of early adolescents.\\n                Youths (N = 514, mean age 11.5 years at recruitment) were assigned randomly by community site to receive the CD-ROM intervention, the CD-ROM plus parent intervention, or no intervention. All youths completed pretest, posttest and three annual follow-up measurements. After pretesting, youths and parents received their respective interventions.\\n                Main effects of the intervention and for measurement occasion as well as interaction effects of the intervention by measurement occasion were seen for substance use and related outcomes. Over time, youths in all 3 groups reported increased use of alcohol, tobacco and marijuana; youths who received the interventions reported smaller increases than control youths. At 3-year follow-up, alcohol use was lower for CD-ROM plus parent intervention youths than for CD-ROM only youths, who, in turn, reported less use than controls. Cigarette use was lower for youths in either intervention group than in the control group at posttest and at 1-, 2- and 3-year follow-ups. Marijuana use was lower for youths in either intervention than for controls at 1-, 2- and 3-year follow-ups. Youths in both intervention groups outperformed control youths at posttest and at 1- and 3-year follow-ups on levels of negative and peer influence toward substance use.

The purpose of this paper is to describe the CATCH tobacco use intervention and measurement, including the adoption of tobacco-free school policies.\\n                In this study, changes in school tobacco use policies and smoking experimentation among students were assessed. Smoking experimentation was measured in all CATCH schools when the students were in their fifth-grade year. A total of 6,527 subjects in 96 schools in California, Louisiana, Minnesota, and Texas answered questions about behaviors and potential correlates of smoking as part of the CATCH health behavior questionnaire in Spring 1994. School tobacco use policy, an important complement to classroom- and home-based prevention efforts, was promoted as part of the CATCH intervention. The degree to which such policy was implemented was measured using surveys of school officials.\\n                At the end of fifth grade, only 4.8% of the subjects indicated that they had experimented with tobacco. School intervention condition was not a factor in the prediction of experimentation. Those whose best friend or sibling smoked, or who had ready access to cigarettes in the home, were more likely to have experimented with smoking. In the 3 years of the study, the percentages of tobacco-free schools went up from 49.7 to 76.8%. Though differences in the rate of policy adoption could not be directly attributed to the CATCH intervention, the implementation of the tobacco-free schools' policies did vary substantially from state to state. Minnesota and Texas, with stronger state laws supporting local policy, had nearly completely smoke-free schools. In spite of a statewide tobacco control initiative, California was slower to implement school policies. Louisiana, which allows local decision making regarding smoking policy, had the most difficulty establishing a policy for all districts.\\n                Future studies should examine the impact of parallel policy interventions that are ongoing at both school and state levels. Tobacco-free policies appear to be a crucial part of school-based interventions and must be tailored to political and regional factors affecting a given school district.\"\n 'While most intervention studies on coronary heart disease have focused on the high-risk person only, the present study used the family as the unit of intervention. In the study 1373 high-risk men, ages 30-54 years, were identified on the basis of high total cholesterol (TC) and/or low relative high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) (HDL-C/TC) following the 1979/1980 survey in TromsÃ¸. The men and their families were randomly allocated to a control or intervention condition. The intervention families were given advice on diet, smoking, and exercise. At rescreening in 1986/1987, significantly lower risk factor levels were found in both the intervention men and their spouses compared with those in the control group. For children, the differences were small and mostly nonsignificant. Men, spouses, and children in the intervention group reported more favorable dietary habits than those in the control group. No differences were found in smoking or leisure time physical activity.'\n \"This study used Complier Average Causal Effect analysis (CACE; see G. Imbens & D. Rubin, 1997) to examine the impact of an adaptive approach to family intervention in the public schools on rates of substance use and antisocial behavior among students ages 11-17. Students were randomly assigned to a family-centered intervention (N = 998) in 6th grade and offered a multilevel intervention that included (a) a universal classroom-based intervention, (b) the Family Check-Up (selected; T. J. Dishion & K. Kavanagh, 2003), and (c) family management treatment (indicated). All services were voluntary, and approximately 25% of the families engaged in the selected and indicated levels. Participation in the Family Check-Up was predicted by 6th-grade teacher ratings of risk, youth reports of family conflict, and the absence of biological fathers from the youths' primary home. Relative to randomized matched controls, adolescents whose parents engaged in the Family Check-Up exhibited less growth in alcohol, tobacco, and marijuana use and problem behavior during ages 11 through 17, along with decreased risk for substance use diagnoses and police records of arrests by age 18.\"\n \"This study reports the follow-up in 1993 of 209 adults, aged 27 to 29 years, who as children had been enrolled in a controlled trial of the prevention of children's behavior disorders. One hundred four control subjects and 105 study subjects, representing 90% of the original cohort, responded to a questionnaire detailing their present social situation and habits, educational achievements, and emotional well-being. The study subjects overall reported significantly fewer neurotic symptoms (p <0.001) than the control subjects; the study women also reported significantly fewer depressive symptoms (p <0.001). A greater proportion of the study subjects, compared with control subjects, had undertaken a university degree or diploma (p <0.013), whereas fewer of the men had attended a school of technology (p <0.049). The study women were less likely to be obese, as defined by a body mass index of 25 or more (p <0.030). The study men and women tended to smoke less than their control subjects, though significant differences were not attained. These results in the experimental group reflected the behavior patterns recorded at 6 years of age, after initial preschool interventional therapy. It appears that the initial benefit obtained from active counseling of mothers about their preschool children's behavior may be long lasting, favorably affecting the individuals' psychologic well-being, educational achievements, and social habits as adults.\"\n \"This study investigated both substantive and methodological issues associated with school-based smoking prevention programs. Substantive issues included the efficacy of a refusal skills training curriculum and of parent messages mailed to students' homes. Methodological issues included the effects of assigning classrooms versus entire schools to experimental conditions and determination of the effects of attrition on internal and external validity. Results revealed differential impact for different subgroups of adolescents. The refusal skills program produced lower rates of smoking than the control condition for students who were smokers at the pretreatment assessment but may have produced detrimental effects among males who were nonsmokers at pretest. The provision of parent messages did not affect outcome. Method of assignment (schools versus classrooms) failed to produce significant effects, and attrition did not affect internal validity. However, the above differential findings, as well as the impact of attrition on external validity, raise questions concerning the generalizability of smoking prevention programs.\"\n \"A program of home visitation by nurses has been shown to affect the rates of maternal welfare dependence, criminality, problems due to use of substances, and child abuse and neglect.

Other measures including further restrictions on access to cigarettes and on the promotion of tobacco products need to be considered. Further research will be needed to develop effective school based health education projects, which should be formally field tested under normal conditions before widespread dissemination.'\n 'To describe the effects of a controlled family-based health education/counseling intervention on health behaviors of children with a familial history of cardiovascular diseases (FH-CVDs).\\n                The intervention group (IG, n=432) received 5 counseling sessions. The control groups 1 (CG1, n=200) and 2 (CG2, n=423) received no counseling. Outcome measures comprised changes in diet, exercise, and cigarette smoking.\\n                The changes in the use of fats and salt, and in exercise, were more favorable in IG than in CG1 and/or CG2.\\n                Health education/counseling produced positive effects on diet and nutrition in particular and in part in exercise.'\n 'To determine whether the addition of a parental monitoring intervention (Informed Parents and Children Together [ImPACT]) alone or with \"boosters\" could enhance (either broaden or sustain or both) the effect of a small group, face-to-face adolescent risk reduction intervention Focus on Kids (FOK).\\n                A longitudinal, randomized, community-based cohort study was conducted of 35 low-income, community-based, in-town settings. A total of 817 black youths aged 12 to 16 years at baseline were studied. After completion of baseline measures, youths were randomized to receive a face-to-face intervention alone (FOK only), a face-to-face intervention and a parental monitoring intervention (FOK plus ImPACT), or both of the above plus boosters (FOK plus ImPACT plus boosters). Risk and protective behaviors were assessed at 6 and 12 months after intervention.\\n                At 6 months\\' follow-up, youths in families that were assigned to FOK plus ImPACT reported significantly lower rates of sexual intercourse, sex without a condom, alcohol use, and cigarette use and marginally lower rates of \"risky sexual behavior\" compared with youths in families that were assigned to FOK only. At 12 months after intervention, rates of alcohol and marijuana use were significantly lower and cigarette use and overall risk intention were marginally lower among FOK plus ImPACT youths compared with FOK only youths. With regard to the boosters delivered at 7 and 10 months, 2 risk behaviors--use of crack/cocaine and drug selling--were significantly lower among the youths who were assigned to receive the additional boosters compared with youths without the boosters. The rates of the other risk behaviors and intentions did not differ significantly.\\n                The results of this randomized, controlled trial indicate that the inclusion of a parental monitoring intervention affords additional protection from involvement in adolescent risk behaviors 6 and 12 months later compared with the provision of an intervention that targets adolescents only. At the same time, the results of the present study do not provide sufficient evidence that booster sessions further improve targeted behaviors enough to include them in a combined parent and youth intervention.'\n \"In autumn 1995 The Norwegian Cancer Society in cooperation with The Research Center for Health Promotion, University of Bergen started a study of school-based interventions aiming at preventing smoking among pupils in Norwegian secondary schools. The study comprised a nationwide sample of 4441 students at 99 schools (195 classes). This panel of students is followed through annual data collections till they graduate in spring 1997. Written consensus from students and parents was obtained from 95%. Schools were systematically allocated to one of four groups: Group A, control; Group B, intervention, containing classroom program, involvement of parents and teacher courses; Group C, like B, but without teacher courses; Group D, like B, but without parental involvement. Baseline data were collected by questionnaires administered in class in November 1994 and the first follow-up survey was carried out in May 1995. At follow-up the proportion of smokers had increased by 8.3 percentage points in Group A (control) and by 1.9 percentage points in Group B (most extensive intervention). As expected, the recruitment of smokers was higher in Groups C and D than in the ideal intervention, but lower than in the control group. Effects of the most extensive program among subgroups of students were examined by comparing Groups A and B. Students are categorized as high risk or low risk based on scores on scales measuring sensation seeking, physical maturity, antisocial behavior and parental smoking. The effect of the program on recruitment of smokers seems to have been at least as strong or even stronger among 'high-risk' students than among other students.\"\n 'This study examined the long-term substance use outcomes of 2 brief interventions designed for general population families of young adolescents. Thirty-three public schools were randomly assigned to 3 conditions: the 5-session Preparing for the Drug Free Years Program, the 7-session Iowa Strengthening Families Program, and a minimal contact control condition. The pretest involved 667 6th graders and their families. Assessments included multiple measures of initiation and current use of alcohol, tobacco, and marijuana. Pretest data were collected in the 6th grade and the reported follow-up data were collected in the 10th grade. Significant intervention-control differences in initiation and current use were found for both interventions. It is concluded that brief family skills-training interventions designed for general populations have the potential to reduce adolescent substance use and thus have important public health implications.'\n 'This study evaluated the substance initiation effects of an intervention combining family and school-based competency-training intervention components. Thirty-six rural schools were randomly assigned to 1 of 3 conditions: (a) the classroom-based Life Skills Training (LST) and the Strengthening Families Program: For Parents and Children 10-14, (b) LST only, or (c) a control condition. Outcomes were examined 1 year after the intervention posttest, using a substance initiation index (SII) measuring lifetime use of alcohol, cigarettes, and marijuana and by rates of each individual substance. Planned intervention-control contrasts showed significant effects for both the combined and LST-only interventions on the SII and on marijuana initiation. Relative reduction rates for alcohol initiation were 30.0% for the combined intervention and 4.1% for LST only.'\n \"To evaluate Smoke-free Kids, a new home based programme to assist parents who smoke in socializing their children against smoking.\\n                Two year randomised controlled trial.\\n                At baseline, 887 adult smokers who had an abstinent child in the third grade (ages 7-8 years); 671 adults and children were retained through the 24 month follow up.\\n                Programme modules, newsletters, incentives, support calls.\\n                Anti-smoking socialisation; susceptibility to smoking.\\n                Of 327 parents randomised to treatment, 210 obtained adequate treatment by using at least three of five core modules. Programme efficacy analyses, which compared these parents with controls (n = 344), showed that exposure to adequate treatment predicted significantly higher levels in nearly all categories of anti-smoking socialisation three months post-intervention. Two years post-baseline, children of parents who reported adequate treatment scored significantly higher than controls on attributes that reduce susceptibility to smoking, and they scored significantly lower than controls on attributes that raise susceptibility to smoking. Programme effectiveness analyses compared all parents randomised to treatment (n = 327) with controls (n = 344). Treatment effects were evident for several socialisation outcomes; however, these effects were smaller and less consistent than those from the efficacy analyses. Similarly, although treated children scored higher than controls on attributes that reduce susceptibility and lower than controls on attributes that raise susceptibility, several of these between-group differences were not significant.\\n                Given adequate exposure to the Smoke-free Kids programme, significant beneficial effects were observed on anti-smoking socialisation in households where parents smoke cigarettes, and significant beneficial effects were observed on children's susceptibility to smoking after two years. Improving programme acceptance and utilisation is necessary before programme effectiveness can be demonstrated.\"\n \"In this article, we examine the impact of two universal, grade 1 preventive interventions on the onset of tobacco smoking as assessed in early adolescence. The classroom-centered (CC) intervention was designed to reduce the risk for tobacco smoking by enhancing teachers' behavior management skills in first grade and, thereby, reducing child attention problems and aggressive and shy behavior-known risk behaviors for later substance use. The family-school partnership (FSP) intervention targeted these early risk behaviors via improvements in parent-teacher communication and parents' child behavior management strategies. A cohort of 678 urban, predominately African-American, public school students were randomly assigned to one of three Grade 1 classrooms at entrance to primary school (age 6). One classroom featured the CC intervention, a second the FSP intervention, and the third served as a control classroom. Six years later, 81% of the students completed audio computer-assisted self-interviews. Relative to controls, a modest attenuation in the risk of smoking initiation was found for students who had been assigned to either the CC or FSP intervention classrooms (26% versus 33%) (adjusted relative risk for CC/control contrast=0.57, 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.34-0.96; adjusted relative risk for FSP/control contrast=0.69, 95% CI, 0.50-0.97). Results lend support to targeting the early antecedent risk behaviors for tobacco smoking.\"\n 'Each day more than 2000 youth under age 18 become daily smokers and the age of tobacco initiation has been going down. Health care settings can partner with families to encourage parent-child interactions that prevent youth tobacco use. This study evaluates a smoking prevention intervention package for parents and children (aged 10-12) provided through their managed care organization.\\n                A two-arm (usual care vs intervention) randomized trial was employed. The intervention included a mailed parental smoking prevention kit, outreach follow-up telephone calls to the parent by a health educator, child materials, medical record cues for physicians to deliver prevention messages, and parent newsletter. Outcome measures were susceptibility to smoking, experimentation with smoking, and smoking in the past 30 days as assessed by 20-month follow-up surveys of children.\\n                A total of 4,026 families enrolled in the study. The response rate to the 20-month follow-up was 88%. There were no significant effects of the intervention on any of the primary outcomes. The intervention was associated with modest but statistically significant increases in parent-child discussions of smoking related topics.\\n                A minimal-intensity family-based prevention program did not significantly reduce rates of susceptibility or tobacco use among youth aged 10-12 at baseline and 11 to 14 at follow-up. Development and evaluation of innovative approaches to tobacco use prevention must continue, despite our disappointing results. Parents and health care systems are too important to abandon as channels for prevention messages.'\n 'The study tested alternative intervention strategies to reduce escalation in problem behaviors among high-risk young adolescents (11 to 14 years old). A total of 158 families with young adolescents (male and female) participated in this study. Of these, 119 families were randomly assigned to 1 of the following intervention conditions: (a) parent focus, (b) teen focus, (c) parent and teen focus, (d) self-directed change (materials only). In addition, 39 families of young adolescents were recruited as a quasi-experimental control. Parent focus and teen focus interventions resulted in immediate beneficial effects in observed and reported family conflict. The parent intervention conditions showed immediate beneficial effects on behavior problems at school. Longitudinal trends suggest that the parent focus condition may reduce subsequent tobacco use, compared with all other approaches. Interventions that aggregated high-risk youths into groups, however, showed the highest escalations in tobacco use and problem behavior at school, beginning at termination and persisting to follow-up. These findings are discussed with respect to the need to re-evaluate strategies that aggregate high-risk youths into intervention programs and focus more on strategies to engage parents in prevention.']",
         "Some well-executed RCTs show family interventions may prevent adolescent smoking, but RCTs which were less well executed had mostly neutral or negative results. There is thus a need for well-designed and executed RCTs in this area."

         "[\"Corticosteroids are effective in acute Crohn's disease (CD). The present study assessed the effectiveness and safety of oral pH-modified release budesonide (BUD) in patients with active CD in comparison with 6-methylprednisolone (MPred).\\n                This was a prospective multicentre, randomized, double-blind, double-dummy study.\\n                A total of 67 patients with active CD (CDAI > 150) were included. Patients were treated with 3 x 3 mg BUD (n = 34) or MPred (n = 33) according to a weekly tapering schedule (48-32-24-20-16-12-8 mg). The primary aim was remission of CD (CDAI < 150 and decrease by at least 60 points from baseline) after eight weeks.\\n                Baseline demographics, disease activity and localization of CD in the small bowel and the colon were similar in both treatment groups. On an intention-to-treat basis 19/34 patients in the BUD group (55.9%) and 24/33 patients in the MPred group (72.7%) were in remission after eight weeks (P = 0.237). Therapy failed in 15/34 patients (44.1%) of the BUD group and in 9/33 patients (27.3%) of the MPred group. The mean CDAI decreased from 262 +/- 50 to 118 +/- 69 in the BUD-group and from 262 +/- 81 to 95 +/- 61 in the Mored group (P = 0.183, final CDAI BUD vs. MPred). Steroid-related side effects appeared in 28.6% of the patients in the BUD group and in 69.7% of the patients in the Mored group (P = 0.0015).\\n                Oral pH-modified release budesonide (3 x 3 mg/day) is almost as effective as a conventional corticosteroid in patients with active CD but causes significantly less corticosteroid-related side effects.\"\n \"Budesonide controlled ileal release (CIR) capsules deliver budesonide, a glucocorticosteroid with high topical and low systemic activity, to the distal ileum and the proximal colon. In four previous controlled trials in Crohn's disease, remission rates ranged from 51% to 69%. We sought to evaluate the efficacy and safety of this drug in a population of patients in the United States with Crohn's disease.\\n                In this multicenter, double blind, randomized trial, 200 patients in the United States with mild to moderate Crohn's disease (Crohn's Disease Activity Index [CDAI] between 200 and 450) involving the distal ileum and/or ascending colon received 9 mg of budesonide CIR once daily, 4.5 mg b.i.d., or placebos for 8 wk. The primary outcome was remission defined by a CDAI of 150 or less.\\n                Remission was achieved in 48%, 53%, and 33% with 9 mg once daily, 4.5 mg b.i.d., and placebos, respectively, after 8 wk of treatment. Differences between the groups were not significant. The differences in mean change from baseline CDAI between the combined budesonide and placebo groups was significant (p < 0.05). There was no difference in observed adverse events between treatment groups, although a modest decrease in plasma cortisol levels was observed relative to the placebo (p < 0.01).\\n                Treatment of symptomatic Crohn's disease with budesonide CIR capsules (9 mg daily) was safe, and remission rates were similar to those achieved in previous trials. Although the remission rate did not significantly differ from the placebo response in this study, there was a significant change in the mean CDAI from baseline in the combined treatment groups relative to the placebo.\"\n 'Budesonide has been found effective in patients with mild and moderate Crohn disease and has been found to cause fewer side effects than prednisone. The use of oral budesonide has not been prospectively evaluated in children with Crohn disease. Therefore, the authors initiated a trial to compare remission and tolerance to budesonide and prednisone in children with mild or moderately active Crohn disease.\\n                A prospective randomized open controlled 12-week trial was carried out comparing pH modified release budesonide, 9 mg, versus prednisone, 40 mg, in children with active mild to moderate pediatric Crohn disease.\\n                Thirty-three patients (20 boys and 13 girls; mean age, 14.3 years) enrolled and completed the study. The groups treated with budesonide and prednisone did not differ by age, onset of disease, location of disease, or disease activity. The remission rate at 12 weeks was 47% in the budesonide treatment group and 50% in the prednisone treatment group. Side effects occurred in 32% and 71% of patients treated with budesonide and prednisone, respectively (P< 0.05). Severity of cosmetic side effects was significantly lower in patients treated with budesonide (P< 0.01).\\n                Remission rates for Crohn disease with budesonide and prednisone treatment in this study were similar. Pediatric patients treated with budesonide had significantly fewer side effects than patients treated with prednisone. Budesonide should be considered an alternative to prednisone in pediatric patients with mild to moderate disease activity.'\n \"Budesonide is a steroid with low systemic effect and high effectiveness in the treatment of Crohn's Disease (CD). Beclomethasone dipropionate (BDP) is also a steroid with the same systemic effects, but it has been never investigated in CD.\\n                To evaluate the effectiveness and tolerability of BDP versus budesonide in treating CD, we enrolled 30 consecutive patients affected by mild-to-moderate non-fistulizing, non-obstructive Crohn's disease (CDAI < or = 250) (13 M and 17 F, mean age: 33.4 years, range: 16-71 years) in whom this diagnosis was made for the first time. The patients were randomly treated for 8 weeks with budesonide 9 mg/day (group A, 15 patients) or with BDP 10 mg/day (group B, 15 patients).\\n                Of group A patients, 13/14 (on intention to treat (i-t-t): 86.67%) showed response to budesonide and 10/14 (on i-t-t.: 66.66%) were in remission after 8 weeks of treatment. In group B patients, 10/14 (on i-t-t: 66.66%) showed response to BDP and 8/14 (on i-t-t: 53.33%) were in remission after 8 weeks of treatment (p<0.001). Budesonide was also faster in the time to obtain symptomatic remission (p=n.s.) and was better in improving IBDQL (p<0.05). Regarding side effects, two group A patients (6.66%) and three group B patients (10%) experienced mild-to-moderate side effects which were transitory and did not require any specific treatment or stopping the treatment.\\n                BDP seems to be less effective than budesonide in treating CD, probably due to better the pharmacokinetic properties of budesonide.\"\n \"The use of corticosteroids in active Crohn's disease often becomes limited by side effects. Budesonide is a potent corticosteroid with low systemic bioavailability due to an extensive first pass liver metabolism.\\n                To compare the efficacy and safety of two dosage regimens of budesonide and prednisolone in patients with active Crohn's disease affecting the ileum and/or the ascending colon.\\n                One hundred and seventy eight patients were randomised to receive budesonide controlled ileal release (CIR) capsules 9 mg once daily or 4.5 mg twice daily, or prednisolone tablets 40 mg once daily. The treatment period was 12 weeks. The primary efficacy variable was clinical remission, defined as a Crohn's Disease Activity Index (CDAI) of 150 or less.\\n                After eight weeks of treatment, remission occurred in 60% of patients receiving budesonide once daily or prednisolone and in 42% of those receiving budesonide twice daily (p = 0.062). The presence of glucocorticoid associated side effects was similar in all groups; however, moon face was more common in the prednisolone group (p = 0.0005). The highest frequency of impaired adrenal function, as measured by a short ACTH test, was found in the prednisolone group (p = 0.0023).\\n                Budesonide CIR, administered at 9 mg once daily or 4.5 mg twice daily, is comparable to prednisolone in inducing remission in active Crohn's disease. The single dose administration is as promptly effective as prednisolone and represents a simpler and safer therapeutic approach, with a considerable reduction in side effects.\"\n \"Corticosteroids are the most efficacious drugs for inducing remission in active Crohn's disease, but their benefits are frequently offset by serious side effects. Budesonide is a corticosteroid with high topical antiinflammatory activity but low systemic activity because of extensive hepatic metabolism. We investigated the efficacy and safety of an oral controlled-ileal-release preparation of budesonide in patients with active Crohn's disease involving the ileum or ileum and proximal colon.\\n                In a double-blind, multicenter trial, 258 patients were randomly assigned to receive placebo or one of three doses of budesonide--3, 9, or 15 mg daily. The primary outcome measure was clinical remission, as defined by a score of 150 or less on the Crohn's disease activity index.\\n                After eight weeks of treatment, remission occurred in 51 percent of the patients in the group receiving 9 mg of budesonide (95 percent confidence interval, 39 to 63 percent), 43 percent of those receiving 15 mg (95 percent confidence interval, 31 to 55 percent), and 33 percent of those receiving 3 mg (95 percent confidence interval, 21 to 44 percent), as compared with 20 percent of those receiving placebo (P < 0.001, P = 0.009, and P = 0.13, respectively). Improvements in the quality of life, as measured by the patients' responses to the inflammatory bowel disease questionnaire, paralleled these remission rates. Location of disease, prior surgical resection, and previous use of corticosteroids did not affect the outcome. A total of 119 patients (46 percent) were withdrawn from the study before the trial ended, 96 because of insufficient therapeutic effects, 13 because of adverse reactions, and 10 because of noncompliance. Budesonide caused a dose-related reduction in basal and corticotropin-stimulated plasma cortisol concentrations but was not associated with clinically important corticosteroid-related symptoms or other toxic effects.\\n                In an eight-week trial, an oral controlled-release preparation of budesonide at an optimal daily dose of 9 mg was well tolerated and effective against active Crohn's disease of the ileum and proximal colon.\"\n \"Glucocorticosteroids are used frequently for the treatment of relapses of Crohn's disease.\\n                To investigate the influence of the new topically active glucocorticosteroid budesonide in comparison with methylprednisolone on bone turnover in a randomized open trial.\\n                Twenty-nine patients received either budesonide (controlled ileal release formulation) 9 mg for 10 weeks, or methylprednisolone 32 mg (equivalent to 40 mg prednisone) orally for 3 weeks with subsequent tapering.\\n                Patients who completed the trial with methylprednisolone (n = 8) had suppression of serum osteocalcin (30.2 +/- 2.6 to 20.4 +/- 2.0 ng/mL. P < 0.01), whereas no changes in this parameter of bone synthesis were observed during budesonide treatment (n = 11) (34.8 +/- 3.1 to 33.0 +/- 3.5 ng/mL). Urinary pyridinolines and deoxypyridinolines, highly sensitive markers of bone degradation, did not change in either group.\\n                Short-term methylprednisolone therapy impairs osteoblast activity in patients with Crohn's disease whereas budesonide does not.\"\n \"Patients with active Crohn's disease are often treated with corticosteroids, but the treatment has many side effects. Budesonide is a potent, well-absorbed corticosteroid, but because of a high rate of first-pass metabolism in the liver, its systemic bioavailability is low.\\n                We conducted a randomized, double-blind, 10-week trial comparing the efficacy and safety of an oral controlled-release form of budesonide with the efficacy and safety of prednisolone in 176 patients with active ileal or ileocecal Crohn's disease (88 patients in each treatment group). The dose of budesonide was 9 mg per day for eight weeks and then 6 mg per day for two weeks. The dose of prednisolone was 40 mg per day for two weeks, after which it was gradually reduced to 5 mg per day during the last week.\\n                At 10 weeks, 53 percent of the patients treated with budesonide were in remission (defined as a score < or = 150 on the Crohn's disease activity index), as compared with 66 percent of those treated with prednisolone (P = 0.12). The mean score on the Crohn's disease activity index decreased from 275 to 175 in the budesonide group and from 279 to 136 in the prednisolone group (P = 0.001). Corticosteroid-associated side effects were significantly less common in the budesonide group (29 vs. 48 patients, P = 0.003). Two patients in the prednisolone group had serious complications (one had intestinal perforation and one an abdominal-wall fistula). The mean morning plasma cortisol concentration was significantly lower in the prednisolone group than in the budesonide group after 4 weeks (P < 0.001) and 8 weeks (P = 0.02) of therapy, but not after 10 weeks.\\n                Among patients with active Crohn's disease, both controlled-release budesonide and prednisolone are effective in inducing remission. In this trial, prednisolone reduced scores on the Crohn's disease activity index more, whereas with budesonide there were fewer glucocorticoid-associated side effects and less suppression of pituitary-adrenal function.\"\n \"Budesonide is a corticosteroid with low systemic bioavailability because of its high first-pass metabolism in the liver. In this paediatric, randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, controlled, multicentre trial, the safety and efficacy of budesonide versus prednisolone were evaluated in children with active Crohn's disease.\\n                Forty-eight children, aged 6-16 years, with active Crohn's disease (Crohn's Disease Activity Index > 200) involving ileum and/or ascending colon were randomized to receive budesonide (9 mg/day for 8 weeks, 6 mg/day for 4 weeks) or prednisolone (1 mg/kg/day for 4 weeks, tapering for 8 weeks).\\n                The groups were comparable for age, sex, pubertal stage, disease activity and disease duration. Mean morning plasma cortisol concentration was significantly higher in the budesonide group (200 nmol/l) than in the prednisolone group (98 nmol/l) after 8 weeks, reflecting less adrenal suppression by budesonide (difference -102 nmol/l; 95% CI -226, -52; P = 0.0028). Glucocorticosteroid side effects such as moon face and acne occurred significantly less frequently in the budesonide group. Remission (Crohn's Disease Activity Index < or = 150) was seen at 8 weeks in 12/22 (55%) patients treated with budesonide and in 17/24 (71%) patients receiving prednisolone (difference -16%; 95% CI -45,13; P = 0.25).\\n                Significantly fewer side effects and less adrenal suppression were observed in the children receiving budesonide. Remission rates were not significantly different in the two groups. However, there was a trend for prednisolone to be more effective for inducing remission.\"\n \"Budesonide (BUD) is a potent steroid that undergoes extensive first-pass metabolism. BUD incorporated in a pH-dependent formulation has been proposed as an alternative treatment for Crohn's disease (CD). The aim of this study was to compare the efficacy and safety of BUD and prednisone (PRED) in the treatment of active CD involving the terminal ileum and/or the colon.\\n                Patients with mild to moderately active CD were included in a randomized, double-blind, double-dummy controlled trial. Patients received either 9 mg BUD once daily for 8 weeks or 40 mg PRED once daily for the first 2 weeks tapered gradually to 5 mg/day by the end of the study. Disease activity, quality of life, and laboratory parameters were recorded.\\n                One hundred patients received BUD, and 101 patients received PRED. By intention-to-treat analysis, treatment efficacy defined as Crohn's Disease Activity Index of <150 at completion was 51% and 52.5% for the BUD and PRED groups, respectively. Twice as many responded to treatment with no side effects in the BUD compared with the PRED group (30% vs. 14%) (P = 0.006). Most of the decrease in CDAI scores occurred during the first 2 weeks.\\n                BUD is as effective as PRED in the treatment of CD involving the terminal ileum and right colon. BUD has significantly fewer steroid-related adverse reactions.\"\n \"Our aims were to assess the impact on health-related quality of life (HRQOL) of a controlled ileal release (CIR) formulation of budesonide in active Crohn's disease (CD) and further define the role of HRQOL, using the Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire (IBDQ), in assessing outcome in CD. A randomized trial was conducted in 258 patients with active ileal or ileocecal CD. Budesonide CIR 1.5 mg, 4.5 mg, 7.5 mg, or placebo was given b.i.d. for 8 weeks. IBDQ score changes were compared among groups. Correlations for IBDQ and Crohn's Disease Activity Index (CDAI) scores were calculated. Mean IBDQ scores improved significantly over placebo by 2 weeks in budesonide 15 mg (155+/-38; p = 0.006) and 9 mg groups (157+/-33; p = 0.0002). Bowel, systemic, social, and emotional subscores were also significantly better (p < 0.002) at 2 and 8 weeks in the 9 mg group. Improved HRQOL scores correlated well with decreased CDAI (-0.8 < r < -0.4). Average per item change in IBDQ at remission was 1.17 to 1.48. Prior surgery (p < 0.005) or current smoker (p < 0.05) status predicted poorer initial HRQOL but not response. Budesonide CIR 9 or 15 mg/day rapidly and significantly improved HRQOL in active CD.\"\n \"Controlled ileal release budesonide and slow release mesalazine are both used to treat mild to moderate active Crohn's disease, although data show that budesonide is more effective in inducing remission. When comparing different treatment options, the effects of agents on health-related quality of life must be considered as well as efficacy. In this study, we sought to compare the effects of budesonide and mesalazine on the health-related quality of life of patients with active Crohn's disease.\\n                The study included 182 patients with Crohn's Disease Activity Index scores between 200 and 400. Patients were randomized in a double blind, double dummy, multicenter study to receive 9 mg of budesonide, once daily (n = 93), or 2 g of mesalazine, b.i.d. (n = 89), for 16 wk. Quality of life was assessed at baseline and after 2, 4, 8, 12, and 16 wk of treatment using the Psychological General Well-Being index. In addition, a physician's global evaluation was used to assess how symptoms affected patients' normal activities.\\n                Patients treated with budesonide experienced significantly greater improvement in Psychological General Well-Being scores than the group treated with mesalazine after 2, 8, 12, and 16 wk. All components of this index showed greater improvements in the budesonide-treated group than in the mesalazine group at 12 and 16 wk. The physician's global evaluation showed significantly greater improvements in the budesonide group than in the mesalazine group at all visits.\\n                Budesonide (9 mg once daily) improves health-related quality of life to a greater extent than mesalazine (2 g b.i.d.) in patients with mild to moderate active Crohn's disease.\"\n \"To study the effect of oral budesonide and prednisolone on peripheral blood natural killer (NK) cell activity in patients with active ileocaecal Crohn's disease (Crohn's disease activity index, CDAI > or = 200).\\n                One group of patients was treated for 10 weeks with oral budesonide (n = 9; 9 mg/day), and another group of patients for the same period with prednisolone (n = 9; 40 mg/day). Budesonide was tapered to 6 mg/day after 8 weeks and prednisolone after 2 weeks to 5 mg/day in the last week. Before treatment, and at 2, 4 and 10 weeks of treatment, natural killer cell activity was determined with a 51Cr release assay, and the number of CD16+ NK cells by Fluorescence activated cell sorter (FACS) analysis.\\n                Budesonide, as well as prednisolone treatment, significantly decreased natural killer cell activity at weeks 2 and 4. This decrease was found to be accompanied by a similar decrease in the number of CD16+ NK cells. At 10 weeks, natural killer cell activity had almost returned to pre-treatment levels in the budesonide group and was significantly higher than pre-treatment levels in the prednisolone group. Disease activity was significantly decreased in all patients at week 2 until the end of the trial period.\\n                Both budesonide and prednisolone treatment suppress peripheral blood natural killer cell activity of patients with active ileocaecal Crohn's disease by decreasing the numbers of CD16+ NK cells in the circulation.\"]",
         "Budesonide is more effective than placebo or mesalamine for induction of remission in Crohn's disease. Although short-term efficacy with budesonide is less than with conventional steroids, particularly in those with severe disease or more extensive colonic involvement, the likelihood of adverse events and adrenal suppression is lower."

         "['We speculated that prophylactic ligation of the ductus arteriosus would reduce mortality and morbidity in very-low-birth-weight infants. To test this hypothesis, we randomly assigned 84 babies who weighed 1000 g or less at birth and required supplemental oxygen either to receive standard treatment (n = 44) or to undergo prophylactic surgical ligation of the ductus arteriosus on the day of birth (n = 40). The ductus was ligated in babies in the control group only if the shunt was hemodynamically important. All the babies were followed for one year. The incidence of necrotizing enterocolitis was reduced in the group that underwent prophylactic ligation (3 of 40 [8 percent]) as compared with the control group (13 of 44 [30 percent]; P = 0.002). The frequency of death, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, retinopathy of prematurity, and intraventricular hemorrhage was similar in both groups. Because early enteral feeding may have increased the incidence of necrotizing enterocolitis, we analyzed separately the babies who were fed early. Among the infants who were fed within 14 days of birth, those who underwent prophylactic ligation had a lower incidence of necrotizing enterocolitis (1 of 11 [9 percent]) than those who did not (13 of 24 [54 percent]; P = 0.001). Within the control group, the infants who were fed within 14 days of birth and whose ductus was ligated for medical reasons within 5 days of birth had a lower incidence of necrotizing enterocolitis (2 of 10 [20 percent]) than those whose ductus was ligated later or not at all (11 of 14 [79 percent]; P = 0.004). We conclude that early surgical closure of the ductus arteriosus reduces the risk of necrotizing enterocolitis in infants of very low birth weight who require supplemental oxygen.']",
         "Prophylactic surgical ligation of the PDA did not decrease mortality or BPD in ELBW infants. A significant reduction of stage II or III NEC was noted. Based on the current evidence, the high rate of spontaneous closure, availability of effective safe medical therapies, and the potential short and long-term complications of surgical ligation, the use such prophylactic surgical therapy is not indicated in the management of the preterm infants."

         "['Treatment with acetyl L-carnitine (ALCAR) has been shown to improve fatigue in patients with chronic fatigue syndrome, but there have been no trials on the effect of ALCAR for treating fatigue in multiple sclerosis (MS). To compare the efficacy of ALCAR with that of amantadine, one of the drugs most widely used to treat MS-related fatigue, 36 MS patients presenting fatigue were enrolled in a randomised, double-blind, crossover study. Patients were treated for 3 months with either amantadine (100 mg twice daily) or ALCAR (1 g twice daily). After a 3-month washout period, they crossed over to the alternative treatment for 3 months. Patients were rated at baseline and every 3 months according to the Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS), the primary endpoint of the study. Secondary outcome variables were: Fatigue Impact Scale (FIS), Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) and Social Experience Checklist (SEC). Six patients withdrew from the study because of adverse reactions (five on amantadine and one on ALCAR). Statistical analysis showed significant effects of ALCAR compared with amantadine for the Fatigue Severity Scale (p = 0.039). There were no significant effects for any of the secondary outcome variables. The results of this study show that ALCAR is better tolerated and more effective than amantadine for the treatment of MS-related fatigue.'\n \"Fatigue is a common symptom of multiple sclerosis (MS) that is without an effective treatment. A double-blind, controlled study of fatigue treatment was conducted to evaluate the efficacy of amantadine hydrochloride in treating MS-associated fatigue. Since fatigue cannot be characterized by a single symptom or behavior, a variety of neuropsychological, behavioral, and self-report measures were used to monitor changes across different systems. According to patients' daily diary ratings, amantadine produced small but statistically significant improvements in fatigue across four of seven dimensions (overall energy level, concentration, problem solving, and sense of well-being). In addition, patients with MS who were taking amantadine performed slightly better on the Stroop Interference Test, an attentional measure of freedom from distracting information. Although retrospective reports by patients with MS did not confirm the degree of improvement recorded on a daily basis, the study's results suggested that amantadine may offer modest benefits in alleviating the day-to-day subjective experience of fatigue.\"\n \"To determine the relative efficacy of amantadine, pemoline, and placebo in treatment of multiple sclerosis (MS)-related fatigue.\\n                Fatigue is a complication of MS. Both pemoline and amantadine have been used to treat MS fatigue, but their relative efficacy is not known.\\n                Amantadine, pemoline, and placebo were compared in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study using a parallel-group design. Ninety-three ambulatory MS patients completed the study. Primary outcome measures were the fatigue severity scale (FSS); the MS-specific fatigue scale (MS-FS); and subjective response determined by verbal self-report. Secondary outcome measures consisted of assessments of sleep, depression, and vitality. Repeated-measures analysis of variance with planned post-hoc contrasts and Fisher's exact test were used to compare treatment response.\\n                Amantadine-treated patients showed a significantly greater reduction in fatigue, as measured by the MS-FS, than did patients treated with placebo (p = 0.04). By verbal report at the end of the study, 79% of patients treated with amantadine versus 52% treated with placebo and 32% treated with pemoline preferred drug therapy compared with no treatment (p = 0.03). No significant differences in any primary outcome measures were noted between pemoline and placebo. Neither amantadine nor pemoline affected sleep or depression relative to placebo.\\n                Amantadine was significantly better than placebo in treating fatigue in MS patients, whereas pemoline was not. The benefit of amantadine was not due to changes in sleep, depression, or neurologic disability.\"\n 'In a double-blind placebo-controlled crossover study of ten patients with multiple sclerosis, we found amantadine hydrochloride therapy to be effective in improving fatigability in six. Administration of the drug was associated with significantly higher levels of beta-endorphin-beta-lipotropin and responders had significantly higher levels than nonresponders. Lactate levels were significantly higher and pyruvate levels lower in nonresponders. Amantadine given for fatigue to patients with multiple sclerosis is associated with measurable changes in levels of metabolites and peptides in the circulation.'\n 'One hundred and fifteen patients with definite multiple sclerosis (M.S.) and chronic persistent fatigue were studied. This ten-week cross-over study consisted of a 2-week baseline period and two 3-week treatment periods separated by a 2-week washout. Patients received either amantadine 100 mg bid or matching placebo capsules. Fatigue, the effect of fatigue on an individually pre-selected activity and its effect on activities of daily living, were evaluated. Amantadine produced a small but statistically significant decrease in fatigue. An important placebo effect was noted. Mean fatigue during the washout period was lower than during the placebo run-in period, independently of which treatment had been given first. Side effects were numerous both on amantadine and on placebo. Only insomnia was significantly more common with amantadine.']",
         "The efficacy of amantadine in reducing fatigue in people with MS is poorly documented, as well as its tolerability. It is advisable to: (1) improve knowledge on the underlying mechanisms of MS-related fatigue; (2) achieve an agreement on accurate, reliable and responsive outcome measures of fatigue; (3) perform good quality RCTs."

Persistence of bacteriuria was associated with amoxicillin-resistant strains in the amoxicillin group but nitrofurantoin-susceptible strains in the nitrofurantoin group. Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole was more successful in eradicating Escherichia coli from rectal cultures soon after therapy and from urethral and vaginal cultures at all follow-up visits compared with the other treatment regimens. Adverse effects were reported by 16 (35%) of 46 patients receiving trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, 18 (43%) of 42 receiving nitrofurantoin, 12 (30%) of 40 receiving cefadroxil, and 13 (25%) of 52 receiving amoxicillin.

The dosages of ofloxacin and trimethoprim-sulphamethoxazole were 100mg and 160mg + 800mg twice daily, respectively. The duration of therapy was 3 days. 81% of the patients had significant bacteriuria. Escherichia coli was isolated in 76% and Staphylococcus saprophyticus in 11% of the infections. The bacteriological elimination, clinical cure and improvement rates of the evaluable patients on ofloxacin treatment were 92 and 95%, respectively. The corresponding figures on trimethoprim-sulphamethoxazole therapy were 88 and 90%. Adverse reactions were clinically unimportant, and none of the patients had to stop treatment. Mild and transient side effects, mainly from the gastrointestinal tract, central nervous system and skin, were reported by 19 and 22% of the patients in the ofloxacin and trimethoprim-sulphamethoxazole groups, respectively. None of the differences in clinical and bacteriological efficacy and side effects of ofloxacin vs trimethoprim-sulphamethoxazole were statistically significant.

The most frequent reason for exclusion was the failure to identify a pretreatment pathogen. The most commonly isolated pathogen was Escherichia coli (81%). Eradication of the pretreatment pathogen at the end of therapy occurred in 94% of ciprofloxacin, 93% of trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, and 97% of ofloxacin-treated patients. At follow-up evaluation at 4 to 6 weeks, recurrence rates (relapse or reinfection) were 11% in the ciprofloxacin, 16% in the trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, and 13% in the ofloxacin treatment group. Clinical success at the end of therapy was 93% in the ciprofloxacin, 95% in the trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, and 96% in the ofloxacin treatment groups.

A total of 30 women in both arms were excluded from the study for various reasons. At 4 to 7 days after the discontinuation of therapy, 62 of 63 (98.4%) cefpodoxime-proxetil recipients and 70 of 70 (100%) trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole patients were clinically cured and demonstrated bacteriological eradication, respectively. At 28 days after treatment, 48 of 55 (87.3%) and 43 of 50 (86%) cefpodoxime-proxetil recipients as well as 51 of 60 (85%) and 42 of 50 (84%) trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole recipients were clinically cured and demonstrated bacteriological eradication, respectively. Independently of the prescribed regimen, a significant difference (P < 0.001) in failure rates was observed only for patients with a previous history of three or more episodes of acute cystitis per year. With the exception of one patient in the trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole arm who discontinued therapy because of gastrointestinal pain, both antimicrobials were well tolerated. In conclusion, cefpodoxime-proxetil treatment for 3 days was as safe and effective as trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole for 3 days for the treatment of uncomplicated acute cystitis in women.'\n 'We compared the safety and efficacies of ofloxacin and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole for the treatment of acute uncomplicated cystitis in women enrolled in a multicenter study. Data from three centers were combined for this report because the study design and study populations were identical, and patients were enrolled within an 18-month period. Cure rates for evaluable patients 4 weeks after treatment were high for all regimens: ofloxacin (200 mg) twice daily for 3 days, 22 of 25 (88%) cured; ofloxacin (200 mg) twice daily for 7 days, 42 of 49 (86%) cured; ofloxacin (300 mg) twice daily for 7 days, 25 of 25 (100%) cured; and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (160/800 mg) twice daily for 7 days, 46 of 52 (88%) cured. Ofloxacin was more effective than trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole in eradicating Escherichia coli from rectal cultures during and 1 week after treatment. Both ofloxacin and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole markedly reduced vaginal colonization with E. coli during and 4 weeks after therapy. Emergence of resistant coliforms in rectal flora was found in 5 (19%) of 27 patients treated with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole but none of 50 ofloxacin-treated patients who were studied (P = 0.004). Adverse effects were equally common among the four treatment groups. We conclude that 3 to 7 days of ofloxacin is as safe and effective as trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole for treatment of uncomplicated cystitis in women and that ofloxacin effectively reduces the fecal and vaginal reservoirs of coliforms in such patients.'\n 'The study was undertaken to compare the safety and efficacy of twice-daily ciprofloxacin for 3 days with standard 7 day therapy with either co-trimoxazole or nitrofurantoin in the treatment of women with acute, uncomplicated urinary tract infections (UTI). This multicentre, prospective, randomized, double-blind trial compared oral ciprofloxacin (100 mg bd) for 3 days with co-trimoxazole (160/800 mg bd) or nitrofurantoin (100 mg bd) for 7 days. Bacteriological and clinical evaluations were performed at study entry, during therapy and 4-10 days and 4-6 weeks after the completion of therapy. The primary efficacy parameter was eradication of the causative organism 4-10 days following treatment. Of 713 women enrolled and evaluable for safety, 521 were evaluable for efficacy (168 ciprofloxacin, 174 co-trimoxazole, 179 nitrofurantoin). Escherichia coli (83%) was the most frequently isolated pathogen in all treatment groups. Bacteriological eradication was reported in 88% of ciprofloxacin patients, 93% of co-trimoxazole patients and 86% of nitrofurantoin patients. At the 4-6 week follow-up, ciprofloxacin had statistically significantly higher eradication rates (91%) than co-trimoxazole (79%; 95% confidence limit (CL) = -20.6%, -3.9%) and nitrofurantoin (82%; 95% CL = -17.1%, -0.9%). Clinical resolution 4-10 days after therapy and at the 4-6 week follow-up was similar among the three treatment groups. The overall incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events was not significantly different (P = 0.093) among the three drug regimens, although co-trimoxazole was associated with a greater number of adverse events than ciprofloxacin (P < or = 0.05). Ciprofloxacin also caused fewer episodes of nausea than either of the other agents (P < or = 0.01).'\n 'We conducted a randomized controlled trial of orally administered amifloxacin versus trimethoprimsulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) as treatments of acute uncomplicated urinary tract infection in women. Amifloxacin at a dosage of 200 mg twice a day appeared as safe and effective as TMP-SMX, but amifloxacin at 400 mg twice a day tended to cause adverse events more frequently than did TMP-SMX.'\n 'To assess the efficacy and safety of a single-dose therapy for acute uncomplicated cystitis (AUC), we compared 4 treatment regimens in 120 women. Patients eligible for the study were randomly assigned to one of four treatment groups: Ciprofloxacin (CPFX) 200 mg in a single oral dose (group A); 200 mg once daily for 3 days (group B); 200 mg twice daily for 3 day (group C); and cefpodoxime-proxcetil (CPDX-PR) 200 mg once daily for 3 days (group D). The efficacy was evaluated 3 days after the single-dose therapy or at the end of a three-day therapy according to the criteria proposed by the Japanese UTI Committee. The overall clinical efficacy in a total of 107 patients was evaluated to be excellent, moderate, and poor in 72 (67.3%), 35 (31.8%), and 1 (0.9%), respectively. The causative organisms were eradicated in 88.0, 85.2, 85.2, and 82.1% of the patients in groups A, B, C, and D, respectively. Recurrence was identified in 3 (2 in group A and one in group D) of 16 patients who were followed at 2 to 3 weeks after the treatment. No adverse reactions related to the antibiotics were recognized in the study. There were no significant differences in the clinical efficacy or recurrence rate among these four treatment regimens. These results indicate that the single-dose therapy of CPFX is the treatment of choice in women with AUC.'\n 'In a prospective, randomized trial, norfloxacin (400 mg perorally, twice a day) was compared with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (160-800 mg perorally, twice a day) in 45 patients with uncomplicated urinary tract infections. Escherichia coli was the most common isolate. Infections due to Enterobacter spp., Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas spp., and Staphylococcus spp. were also treated. Norfloxacin was equivalent in effectiveness and safety to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, with a cure rate of 91% at the 5- to 9-day posttherapy visit and 88% at the 4- to 6-week posttherapy visit. It was well tolerated and had a low incidence of side effects.'\n 'A total of 538 patients from 45 different general practice centres across the UK was admitted to an open study and randomized to one of the following treatment groups: nitrofurantoin modified release (MR) 100 mg bd, trimethoprim 200 mg bd or co-trimoxazole 960 mg bd. Each patient received seven days of medication. Clinical cure, defined as relief from symptoms at visit 2, occurred in 87.2% of the patients treated with nitrofurantoin MR, 84.5% of the co-trimoxazole group and 86.5% of the trimethoprim group. The bacteriological cure rate for nitrofurantoin MR was comparable to co-trimoxazole at 82.3% and 83.2%, respectively, with trimethoprim the lowest at 76.8%. Whilst the cure rate for Escherichia coli infection was similar, 81.5% cured with nitrofurantoin MR, 82.5% with co-trimoxazole and 78.4% by trimethoprim, for non-E. coli pathogens nitrofurantoin MR was equivalent to co-trimoxazole with 86.7% cure but higher than trimethoprim at 72.0%. In-vitro sensitivity to all pathogens isolated at baseline was very high for nitrofurantoin at 96.1%, significantly higher than either co-trimoxazole or trimethoprim at 87.5% (P < 0.01). The test drugs were equally well tolerated with 28 patients (15.7%) reporting adverse events with nitrofurantoin MR, 28 (15.5%) with co-trimoxazole and 28 (15.6%) with trimethoprim. However, nitrofurantoin MR showed fewer patients with drug-related adverse events (5.6%) as judged by the investigator, compared to co-trimoxazole (8.8%) or trimethoprim (7.3%). (ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)'\n 'In a multicentre study 163 women with acute lower urinary tract infection were treated orally with either 125 mg cefuroxime axetil or 100 mg ofloxacin twice daily for three days. Both antimicrobial agents were generally well tolerated. Four patients in the group treated with cefuroxime axetil and two in the group treated with ofloxacin experienced adverse events. Clinical cure and improvement were registered in 56 of 66 (84.8%) and 59 of 62 (95.2%) of the evaluable patients treated with cefuroxime axetil and ofloxacin, respectively. Seven to nine days after therapy, bacteriuria (CFU < 10(3)/ml) had been eliminated in 53 of 66 (80.3%) and 57 of 64 (89.1%) of the evaluable patients receiving cefuroxime axetil and ofloxacin, respectively. The results were not statistically significantly different (p > 0.1). Pathogens present at baseline were eliminated by up to an MIC of 16 mg/l of cefuroxime axetil, independent of susceptibility to this agent. There was no difference with regard to efficacy and tolerance between patients treated with cefuroxime axetil and those treated with ofloxacin. On the basis of the MICs of six antimicrobial agents (cefuroxime, ofloxacin, cefadroxil, ampicillin, trimethoprim with and without sulfamethoxazole) determined for the pathogens isolated prior to therapy, resistance rates were lowest for cefuroxime (2.2%) and ofloxacin (3.4%).'\n 'We performed a controlled double-blind clinical study with PMPC to investigate its therapeutic usefulness in acute simple cystitis in comparison with NA, with the results as follows: 1. In both treatment groups, PMPC proved to be remarkably more active (MIC) than NA against the bacterial isolates tested in vitro. 2. PMPC, administered in dosis (200 mg per day) one-tenth those of NA (2,000 mg per day), produced a greater improvement (therapeutic effects) than NA. 3. Side-effects were apparently less frequent with PMPC, as compared to NA. The results indicate a remarkable usefulness of PMPC in the treatment of acute simple cystitis.'\n 'The high prevalence of resistance to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and other antimicrobials among Escherichia coli causing acute cystitis in women has led to increased use of alternative antibiotics. One such antibiotic, amoxicillin-clavulanate, has not been well studied.\\n                To compare the efficacy of a 3-day regimen of amoxicillin-clavulanate to that of a 3-day regimen of ciprofloxacin in the treatment of acute cystitis in women. The primary study hypothesis was that the amoxicillin-clavulanate and ciprofloxacin treatment groups would differ in clinical cure.\\n                Randomized, single-blind treatment trial of 370 women, aged 18 to 45 years, with symptoms of acute uncomplicated cystitis and a urine culture with at least 10(2) colony-forming units of uropathogens per milliliter from a university student health center or a health maintenance organization.\\n                Women were randomly assigned to receive amoxicillin-clavulanate (500 mg/125 mg twice daily) or ciprofloxacin (250 mg twice daily) for 3 days and were followed up for 4 months.\\n                The main outcome measure was clinical cure. Secondary study outcomes of interest were microbiological cure and vaginal E coli colonization at the 2-week follow-up visit.\\n                Clinical cure was observed in 93 (58%) of 160 women treated with amoxicillin-clavulanate compared with 124 (77%) of 162 women treated with ciprofloxacin (P<.001). Amoxicillin-clavulanate was not as effective as ciprofloxacin even among women infected with strains susceptible to amoxicillin-clavulanate (65 [60%] of 109 women in the amoxicillin-clavulanate group vs 114 [77%] of 149 women in the ciprofloxacin group; P = .004). The difference in clinical cure rates occurred almost entirely within the first 2 weeks after therapy. Microbiological cure at 2 weeks was observed in 118 (76%) of 156 women treated with amoxicillin-clavulanate compared with 153 (95%) of 161 women treated with ciprofloxacin (P<.001). At this visit, 45% of women in the amoxicillin-clavulanate group compared with 10% in the ciprofloxacin group had vaginal colonization with E coli (P<.001).\\n                A 3-day regimen of amoxicillin-clavulanate is not as effective as ciprofloxacin for the treatment of acute uncomplicated cystitis, even in women infected with susceptible strains. This difference may be due to the inferior ability of amoxicillin-clavulanate to eradicate vaginal E coli, facilitating early reinfection.'\n 'Pivmecillinam is a unique beta-lactam antimicrobial that has been used for the treatment of acute uncomplicated urinary infection for > 20 y. Since this agent was introduced, the quinolone antimicrobials have become widely used for the same indication. This study compared the efficacy of a 3-d regimen of pivmecillinam 400 mg b.i.d. with norfloxacin 400 mg b.i.d. Women aged between 18 and 65 y presenting with symptoms of acute cystitis of < 7 d duration were eligible for enrollment; 483 were randomized to receive pivmecillinam and 471 to receive norfloxacin. In each group, 30% of women had negative urine cultures prior to therapy. Bacteriologic cure at early post-therapy follow-up was achieved in 222/298 (75%) pivmecillinam patients and 276/302 (91%) norfloxacin patients [p < 0.001; 95% confidence interval (CI) 12.0-21.8]. Clinical cure/improvement at Day 4 following initiation of therapy was observed in 434/457 (95%) women who received pivmecillinam and 425/442 (96%) who received norfloxacin (p = 0.39; 95% CI 1.5-3.9). Early post-therapy (11 +/- 2 d) clinical cure was achieved in 360/437 women (82%) who received pivmecillinam and 381/433 (88%) who received norfloxacin (p = 0.019; 95% CI 0.9-10.3). In women aged < or = 50 y, early clinical cure rates were 294/351 (84%) for pivmecillinam and 299/340 (88%) for norfloxacin (p = 0.11; 95% CI 1.0-9.4). Adverse effects were similar for both regimens, and there was no evidence of the emergence of organisms of increasing resistance with therapy. Short-course therapy with norfloxacin was superior to that with pivmecillinam in terms of bacteriologic outcome, although differences in clinical outcome were less marked. In conclusion, short-course therapy with pivmecillinam is an effective empirical treatment for pre-menopausal women.'\n 'Sixty-five women with uncomplicated urinary tract infection were evaluated in a prospective, randomized, double blind study comparing ciprofloxacin (250 mg twice daily for ten days) with co-trimoxazole (160 mg trimethoprim and 800 mg sulphamethoxazole twice daily for ten days). Results were analysed with respect to eradication of the urinary tract pathogen, resolution of clinical symptoms, incidence of relapse, and incidence of adverse effects. Among the 31 women who received ciprofloxacin, there was eradication of the micro-organism and complete resolution of clinical symptoms in 100% five to nine days after completion of therapy. Among the 34 patients who received co-trimoxazole, there was eradication in 94% and clinical resolution in 91%. Of the ciprofloxacin-treated women 6.5% (2/31) relapsed compared with 18% (6/34) of co-trimoxazole-treated women. Overall cure rates for 65 patients were 93.5% and 82.3% for ciprofloxacin and co-trimoxazole (difference not statistically significant), respectively. A statistically significant (P less than 0.05) increase in adverse side effects was noted in patients treated with co-trimoxazole. Based upon preliminary data it appears that ciprofloxacin is as effective and less toxic than co-trimoxazole for treatment of uncomplicated urinary tract infection in women.'\n 'Pivmecillinam was compared with cotrimoxazole in the treatment of uncomplicated bacterial cystitis in general practice. Similar bacteriological cure rates were obtained with the two treatments. Although micrococci were judged resistant to pivmecillinam by the disc sensitivity method used, cystitis attributed to these organisms and to resistant strains of Proteus mirabilis responded as readily as those due to apparently sensitive Gram-negative bacteria. Pivmecillinam was well tolerated.'\n 'Forty women with uncomplicated urinary tract infections were assigned randomly to receive 400 mg. norfloxacin or 160 mg. trimethoprim and 800 mg. sulfamethoxazole twice daily for 10 days. Of the 20 patients receiving norfloxacin none had bacteriuria during or 7 days after therapy and 5 patients were reinfected within 6 weeks of therapy discontinuation. Of the 20 patients receiving trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole therapy 1 presented with a strain resistant to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and was excluded from the study. The remaining 19 patients were uninfected during and 7 days after therapy, and 6 patients were reinfected 6 weeks after therapy. All documented recurrences were caused by bacteria sensitive to the initial therapeutic agent. Anal and vaginal Enterobacteriaceae maintained their sensitivity to norfloxacin. One patient on trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole presented with and 2 patients acquired resistant anal and vaginal Enterobacteriaceae. No adverse reactions occurred in either treatment group. Norfloxacin was as effective and safe as trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole without emergence of resistant bacteria associated with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole.']",
         "No differences were observed between the classes of antimicrobials included in this review for the symptomatic cure of acute uncomplicated UTI. Fluoroquinolones proved more effective than beta-lactams for the short-term bacteriological outcome, probably with little clinical significance. Individualised treatment should take into consideration the predictable susceptibility of urinary pathogens in local areas, possible adverse events and resistance development, and patient preference."

         "['This study tested the null hypothesis that the number of fetal surveillance tests and perinatal outcomes would not differ statistically between pregnancies randomized to visual or computerized interpretation of antepartum nonstress test results.\\n                A prospective, randomized controlled trial was conducted, which required a sample size of 404 patients. By using a random-number table with assignment codes concealed in opaque envelopes, half of the patients were randomized to computerized interpretation of nonstress test results and half to standard visual interpretation of nonstress test results. The amount of antepartum testing and the perinatal outcome were measured and compared between the groups. Logistic regression analysis was used to control for maternal risk factors while morbidity differences between the 2 groups were assessed.\\n                The 2 randomized groups were similar at baseline, but the computerized interpretation group had significantly fewer biophysical profiles compared with the visual interpretation group (1.3 +/- 1.8 vs 1.9 +/- 2.1; P =.002). The patients in the computerized interpretation group spent less time per test than patients in the visual interpretation group (12 vs 20 minutes; P =.038). After the 5 pregnancies with congenital anomalies were excluded, the overall perinatal outcome was similar in the 2 groups. The computerized interpretation group, however, had a slightly lower proportion of infants who required >/=2 days of neonatal intensive care (7.4% vs 12.4%; P =.086; odds ratio, 0.56; 95% confidence interval, 0.29-1.09). The average number of neonatal intensive care days was also slightly lower in the computerized interpretation group (0.4 vs 0.9; P =.105). Neither of these variables was statistically significant.\\n                Computerized interpretation of nonstress test results is associated with fewer additional fetal surveillance examinations, less time spent in testing, and a similar length of stay in the neonatal intensive care unit compared with standard visual interpretation.'\n \"The purpose of this study was to evaluate the ability of two different modes of antepartum fetal testing to screen for the presence of peripartum morbidity, as measured by the cesarean delivery rate for fetal distress in labor.\\n                Over a 36-month period, all patients who were referred to the Fetal Assessment Unit at BC Women's Hospital because of a perceived increased fetal antepartum risk at a gestational age of > or =32 weeks of gestation were approached to participate in this study. Fetal surveillance of these women was allocated randomly to either umbilical artery Doppler ultrasound testing or nonstress testing as a screening test for fetal well-being. If either the umbilical artery Doppler testing or the nonstress testing was normal, patients were screened subsequently with the same technique, according to study protocol. When the Doppler study showed a systolic/diastolic ratio of >90th percentile or the nonstress testing was equivocal (ie, variable decelerations), an amniotic fluid index was performed, as an additional screening test. When the amniotic fluid index was abnormal (<5th percentile), induction and delivery were recommended. When the Doppler study showed absent or reversed diastolic blood flow or when the nonstress test result was abnormal, induction and delivery were recommended to the attending physician. Statistical comparisons between groups were performed with an unpaired t test for normally distributed continuous variables and chi(2) test for categoric variables.\\n                One thousand three hundred sixty patients were assigned randomly to groups in the study; 16 patients were lost to follow up. Six hundred forty-nine patients received Doppler testing and 691 received nonstress testing. The mean number of visits for the Doppler test and nonstress test groups was two versus two, respectively. The major indications for fetal assessment included postdates (43%), decreased fetal movement (22%), diabetes mellitus (11%), hypertension (10%), and intrauterine growth restriction (7%). The incidence of cesarean delivery for fetal distress was significantly lower in the Doppler group compared with the nonstress testing group (30 [4.6%] vs 60 [8.7%], respectively; P <.006). The greatest impact on the reduction in cesarean deliveries for fetal distress was seen in the subgroups in which the indication for testing was hypertension and suspected intrauterine growth restriction.\\n                Umbilical artery Doppler as a screening test for fetal well-being in a high-risk population was associated with a decreased incidence of cesarean delivery for fetal distress compared to the nonstress testing, with no increase in neonatal morbidity.\"\n 'Antepartum fetal heart rate testing, specifically the nonstress test, is of accepted value in the antenatal surveillance of high-risk pregnancies. Fetal rest-activity cycles coupled with arbitrary test intervals appear to lead to falsely nonreactive tests. Methods to alter fetal behavioral states have not been uniformly successful. A retrospective analysis of the adjunctive use of acoustic stimulation at our institution demonstrated a 50% reduction in the number of nonreactive tests. Consequently a prospective randomized clinical trial was undertaken to compare the standard nonstress test with the fetal acoustic stimulation test. Those patients randomized to the fetal acoustic stimulation test underwent transabdominal acoustic stimulation with a Model 5C electronic artificial larynx. The incidence of nonreactive tests was 14% in the control group and 9% in the study group (chi 2 = 11.09, p = 0.004). A significant reduction in testing time was also observed. The fetal acoustic stimulation test offers advantages over the traditional nonstress test by lowering the incidence of nonreactive tests and reducing testing time.'\n 'The nonstress test (NST) is a helpful adjunct in the management of high-risk pregnancies. It has high predictability and a low false-negative rate but unfortunately has fairly high false-positive results. Attempts have been made to find a suitable stimulant to help decrease nonreactive results as well as to shorten the duration of testing: the recently introduced fetal acoustic stimulation test (AST) may have such attributes. This prospective, randomized clinical trial was carried out to assess the new test. A total of 1,300 individual tests were performed on high-risk pregnancies. Cases were randomized to receive either the AST or NST. All tracings were interpreted blindly by an independent perinatologist. The incidence of nonreactive tests was 6.8% in the AST group and 13.8% in the NST group (P < .001). There was a significant reduction in the time needed for a reactive test to occur. It can be concluded, therefore, that AST offers a greater advantage over NST by lowering both the incidence of nonreactive tests and testing time, thereby resulting in less of a need for the contraction stress test and biophysical profile.'\n 'Two methods of vibroacoustic stimulation were compared with traditional nonstress tests. Fetal heart rate tracings following stimulation had more accelerations and were of greater amplitude and duration than in the control group. The length of time required to obtain a reactive nonstress test was almost 15 minutes shorter when vibroacoustic stimulation was applied than when vibroacoustic stimulation was not used. Vibroacoustic stimulation elicited a heightened reactivity that persisted beyond the observation period in 30 of 45 (67%) of the experimental group subjects.'\n 'In this prospective blind study, 735 patients with high-risk pregnancies referred for antepartum testing of fetal well-being were randomly assigned to either a fetal biophysical profile scoring (375 patients) or a nonstress testing scheme (360 patients). Management was based on the results of antepartum tests, but the method of testing used was not disclosed. Fetal biophysical profile scoring resulted in a significantly higher positive predictive value in regards to low Apgar scores. Sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy, although higher with fetal biophysical profile scoring, did not demonstrate significant differences when compared with the nonstress test. The negative predictive value between the two methods was similar. All major anomalies were detected during ultrasound scanning, whereas none of these anomalies were detected by heart rate testing alone.'\n 'To assess the effect on obstetric practice of clinician access to umbilical artery Doppler ultrasound results.\\n                Randomised controlled trial.\\n                A large teaching hospital.\\n                Two thousand two hundred and eighty-nine pregnancies defined as being at risk by referral for Doppler or fetal monitoring.\\n                Continuous wave Doppler studies of umbilical artery.

Obstetric intervention: admission to hospital, induction of labour and caesarean section. Use of of fetal well being: cardiotocography, biophysical profile and ultrasound biometry.\\n                The treatment and control groups were comparable in age, parity, gestation at point of entry and risk features. There were no overall differences in perinatal outcome, obstetric intervention or use of fetal monitoring. Examination of a subset recruited only because of hypertension or suspected intrauterine growth retardation (n = 754) similarly showed no difference attributable to group randomisation. Comparison of only those pregnancies retrospectively defined as low risk and high risk showed more use of cardiotocography in the high risk group with access to Doppler (P = 0.007) but no difference in the low risk group.\\n                Doppler umbilical artery recording has been shown to perform well in prediction power of antenatal fetal compromise. What has been examined in this study is the response of clinicians to the test. The results suggest that obstetricians do not use the test to modify their risk assessment, and, therefore, the need for fetal monitoring in particular pregnancies. There is a real need for accumulation of information from very large data sets, particularly in the prediction power of Doppler for antenatal fetal compromise from apparently chronic utero-placental cause to guide use of monitoring resources. If simply added to existing fetal monitoring techniques in a hospital where these are widely used, then umbilical artery Doppler recordings may at present simply involve extra resources of staff and expenses, without benefit.'\n 'The ability of vibratory acoustic stimulation to shorten the duration of antepartum fetal heart rate monitoring was investigated by a randomized controlled trial. Vibratory acoustic stimulation did not shorten the overall duration of testing. This failure to improve the performance of antepartum monitoring appeared to result from prolonged accelerations, which complicated one third of the tests in which vibratory acoustic stimulation was employed. Further investigation is warranted using less profound methods of fetal stimulation.']",
         "There are insufficient data from randomised trials to guide practice regarding the management of DFM. Based on the results of other systematic reviews of management strategies for women whose babies are thought to be at risk of compromise for various reasons, the following strategies show promise and may be prioritised for further research: Doppler ultrasound studies, computerised cardiotocography, and fetal arousal to facilitate cardiotocography.\nFor settings where electronic fetal assessment methods are not available, clinical fetal arousal tests should be investigated."

The rate of cesarean delivery in the nurse-midwife group was 4 percent compared with 15.1 percent in the physician group. The episiotomy rate, excluding cesarean deliveries, for the nurse-midwife group was 15.5 percent compared with 32.9 percent in the physician group. The rates of epidural anesthesia for pain relief in labor were 12.9 percent and 23.7 percent, respectively. Statistically significant differences were found ultrasound examinations, amniotomy, intravenous drug administration during labor, dietary supplements, length of hospital stay, and admission of infants to the neonatal intensive care unit.\\n                The results clearly support the effectiveness of the pilot nurse-midwifery program and suggest that more extensive participation of midwives in the Canadian health care system is an appropriate use of health care dollars.'\n 'In 1996 a new model of maternity care characterized by continuity of midwifery care from early pregnancy through to the postpartum period was implemented for women attending Monash Medical Centre, a tertiary level obstetric service, in Melbourne, Australia. The objective of this study was to compare the new model of care with standard maternity care.\\n                In a randomized controlled trial, 1000 women who booked at the antenatal clinic and met the eligibility criteria were randomly allocated to receive continuity of midwifery care (team care) from a group of seven midwives in collaboration with obstetric staff, or care from a variety of midwives and obstetric staff (standard care). The primary outcome measures were procedures in labor, maternal outcomes, neonatal outcomes, and length of hospital stay.\\n                Women assigned to the team care group experienced less augmentation of labor, less electronic fetal monitoring, less use of narcotic and epidural analgesia, and fewer episiotomies but more unsutured tears. Team care women stayed in hospital 7 hours less than women in standard care. More babies of standard care mothers were admitted to the special care nurseries for more than 5 days because of preterm birth, and more babies of team care mothers were admitted to the nurseries for more than 5 days with intrauterine growth retardation. No differences occurred in perinatal mortality between the two groups.\\n                Continuity of midwifery care was associated with a reduction in medical procedures in labor and a shorter length of stay without compromising maternal and perinatal safety. Continuity of midwifery care is realistically achievable in a tertiary obstetric referral service.'\n \"A team of four midwives provided the majority of care during pregnancy, labour and the puerperium to 503 women at low obstetric risk, over a 2-year period. Compared with standard hospital care randomly allocated to 498 women this 'Know Your Midwife' scheme was associated with greater continuity in all phases of maternity care. The scheme appeared very acceptable to women: they spent less time in the antenatal clinic, and overall, felt more satisfied, better prepared and better able to discuss problems. The scheme was characterised by less obstetric intervention particularly in respect of augmentation of labour and intrapartum analgesia; labours tended to be longer. Neonatal outcome was generally similar in the two groups but the size of the trial did not allow a precise assessment of differential effects in these terms. The 'Know Your Midwife' scheme is feasible. It should now be introduced more widely but in a way which allows continuing evaluation.\"\n \"Although policymakers have suggested that improving continuity of midwifery can increase women's satisfaction with care in childbirth, evidence based on randomized controlled trials is lacking. New models of care, such as birth centers and team midwife care, try to increase the continuity of care and caregiver. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of a new team midwife care program in the standard clinic and hospital environment on satisfaction with antenatal, intrapartum, and postpartum care in low-risk women in early pregnancy.\\n                Women at Royal Women's Hospital in Melbourne, Australia, were randomly allocated to team midwife care (n = 495) or standard care (n = 505) at booking in early pregnancy. Doctors attended most women in standard care, and continuity of the caregiver was lacking. Satisfaction was measured by means of a postal questionnaire 2 months after the birth.\\n                Team midwife care was associated with increased satisfaction, and the differences between the groups were most noticeable for antenatal care, less noticeable for intrapartum care, and least noticeable for postpartum care. The study found no differences between team midwife care and standard care in medical interventions or in women's emotional well-being 2 months after the birth.\\n                Conclusions about which components of team midwife care were most important to increased satisfaction with antenatal care were difficult to draw, but data suggest that satisfaction with intrapartum care was related to continuity of the caregiver.\"\n 'To compare continuity of care from a midwife team with routine care from a variety of doctors and midwives.\\n                A stratified, randomised controlled trial.\\n                814 women attending the antenatal clinic of a tertiary referral, university hospital.\\n                Women were randomly allocated to team care from a team of six midwives, or routine care from a variety of doctors and midwives.\\n                Antenatal, intrapartum and neonatal events; maternal satisfaction; and cost of treatment.\\n                405 women were randomly allocated to team care and 409 to routine care; they delivered 385 and 386 babies, respectively. Team care women were more likely to attend antenatal classes (OR, 1.73; 95% CI, 1.23-2.42); less likely to use pethidine during labour (OR, 0.32; 95% CI, 0.22-0.46); and more likely to labour and deliver without intervention (OR, 1.73; 95% CI, 1.28-2.34). Babies of team care mothers received less neonatal resuscitation (OR, 0.59; 95% CI, 0.41-0.86), although there was no difference in Apgar scores at five minutes (OR, 0.86; 95% CI, 0.29-2.57). The stillbirth and neonatal death rate was the same for both groups of mothers with a singleton pregnancy (three deaths), but there were three deaths (birthweights of 600 g, 660 g, 1340 g) in twin pregnancies in the group receiving team care. Team care was rated better than routine care for all measures of maternal satisfaction. Team care meant a cost reduction of 4.5%.\\n                Continuity of care provided by a small team of midwives resulted in a more satisfying birth experience at less cost than routine care and fewer adverse maternal and neonatal outcomes. Although a much larger study would be required to provide adequate power to detect rare outcomes, our study found that continuity of care by a midwife team was as safe as routine care.'\n 'To test whether a new community-based model of continuity of care provided by midwives and obstetricians improved maternal clinical outcomes, in particular a reduced caesarean section rate.\\n                Randomised controlled trial.\\n                A public teaching hospital in metropolitan Sydney, Australia. Sample 1089 women randomised to either the community-based model (n = 550) or standard hospital-based care (n = 539) prior to their first antenatal booking visit at an Australian metropolitan public hospital.\\n                Data were collected on onset and outcomes of labour, antenatal, intrapartum and postnatal complications, antenatal admissions to hospital and neonatal mortality and morbidity.\\n                There was a significant difference in the caesarean section rate between the groups, 13.3% (73/550) in the community-based group and 17.8% in the control group (96/539). This difference was maintained after controlling for known contributing factors to caesarean section (OR = 0.6, 95% CI 0.4-0.9, P = 0.02). There were no other significant differences in the events during labour and birth. Eighty babies (14.5%) from the community-based group and 102 (18.9%) from the control group were admitted to the special care nursery, but this difference was not significant (OR 0.75, 95% CI 0.5-1.1, P = 0.12). Eight infants died during the perinatal period (four from each group), for an overall perinatal mortality rate of 7.3 per 1000 births.\\n                Community-based continuity of maternity care provided by midwives and obstetricians resulted in a significantly reduced caesarean section rate. There were no other differences in clinical outcomes.'\n \"To compare the outcomes of an adapted pilot Changing Childbirth initiative providing continuity of care by a group of known midwives with traditional maternity care.\\n                Between-groups trial to compare levels of satisfaction and clinical outcomes for two groups of women, cared for either under this Changing Childbirth scheme or the traditional model of care.\\n                Of the 200 women who agreed to participate in the project, 100 were randomly allocated to the pilot scheme and 100 to the traditional care package. During the postpartum period, information was collected via a questionnaire about participants' levels of satisfaction with a variety of aspects of care provided during the antenatal, delivery and postpartum periods. Data about clinical outcomes for the two groups were also obtained.\\n                Women in the pilot group had significantly more continuity of care throughout each of the three periods, were generally more satisfied with their care, felt that they had more choice over a variety of aspects of care and experienced no compromise in clinical outcomes (P = 0.05 or less in each case).\\n                Many previous attempts to introduce the Changing Childbirth initiative have revealed significant problems, particularly with regard to the continuity of carer requirement. Taking account of local health care needs and existing provision, the present study adapted this concept to continuity of care. This did not apparently affect any of the guiding principles contained in the original document, and yet enhanced satisfaction. It would appear that the Changing Childbirth agenda can be adapted and integrated with local health care situations without sacrificing any of the overarching principles.\"\n \"To compare the outcome of two methods of maternity care during the antenatal period and at delivery. One was to be midwife-led for both antenatal care and delivery, the latter taking place in rooms similar to those in one's own home to simulate home confinement. The other would be consultant-led with the mothers labouring in the delivery suite rooms with resuscitation equipment for both mother and baby in evidence, monitors present and a delivery bed on which both anaesthetic and obstetric procedures could be easily and safely carried out.\\n                Randomised controlled trial.\\n                Leicester Royal Infirmary Maternity Hospital.\\n                Of 3510 women who were randomised, 2304 were assigned to the midwife-led scheme and 1206 were assigned to the consultant-led scheme.\\n                Complications in the antenatal, intrapartum and postpartum periods were compared as was maternal morbidity and fetal mortality and morbidity. Satisfaction of the women with care over different periods of the pregnancy and birth were assessed.\\n                There were few significant differences in antepartum, intrapartum and postpartum events between the two groups. There was no difference in the percentage of mothers and babies discharged home alive and well. Generally higher levels of satisfaction with care antenatally and during labour and delivery were shown in those women allocated to midwife care.\"\n \"To evaluate caseload midwifery care in comparison to traditional 'shared care'.\\n                Comparative study with area randomisation.\\n                District general hospital in England.\\n                'Known carer at delivery,' 'normal vaginal delivery' and 'obstetric intervention'.\\n                All pregnant women delivering in the six areas chosen for the study.\\n                A highly significant difference was found between caseload and traditional care groups in terms of level of 'known carer at delivery' (696/770 94.7%; cf. 52/735 (6.7%), p < 0.001). However, no differences in 'normal vaginal delivery' rates were found (542/770 (70%) cf. 509/735 (69%). There were fewer 'obstetric interventions' in the caseload group, particularly epidural analgesia (80/770 (10%) cf. 110/735 (15%) p = 0.01) and oxytocin augmentation (351/77 (46%) cf. 387/735 (53%), p = 0.01). There were no significant differences found in terms of neonatal outcome.\\n                Caseload midwifery results in high levels of 'known carer at delivery' which appears to be associated with a reduction in augmentation and epidural rates but which were not associated with an increase in normal vaginal delivery rate.\"]",

         "['A 2-year milk intervention trial was carried out with 757 girls, aged 10 years, from nine primary schools in Beijing (April 1999 - March 2001). Schools were randomised into three groups: group 1, 238 girls consumed a carton of 330 ml milk fortified with Ca on school days over the study period; group 2, 260 girls received the same quantity of milk additionally fortified with 5 or 8 microg cholecalciferol; group 3, 259 control girls. Anthropometric and bone mineralisation measurements, as well as dietary, health and physical-activity data, were collected at baseline and after 12 and 24 months of the trial. Over the 2-year period the consumption of this milk, with or without added cholecalciferol, led to significant increases in the changes in height (> or =0.6 %), sitting height (> or =0.8 %), body weight (> or 2.9 %), and (size-adjusted) total-body bone mineral content (> or =1.2 %) and bone mineral density (> or =3.2 %). Those subjects receiving additional cholecalciferol compared with those receiving the milk without added 25-hydoxycholecalciferol had significantly greater increases in the change in (size-adjusted) total-body bone mineral content (2.4 v. 1.2 %) and bone mineral density (5.5 v. 3.2 %). The milk fortified with cholecalciferol significantly improved vitamin D status at the end of the trial compared with the milk alone or control groups. It is concluded that an increase in milk consumption, e.g. by means of school milk programmes, would improve bone growth during adolescence, particularly when Ca intake and vitamin D status are low.'\n 'Recent studies have shown a high prevalence of calcium and vitamin D deficiencies in adolescents. The aim of this present study was to follow the changes in calcium status and 25 hydroxyvitamin D (25[OH]D) and parathyroid hormone (iPTH) levels during winter in preadolescents and adolescents from four university hospitals in northern France.\\n                Two groups of teenagers and adolescents (range: 10-15 years) were followed from October 1996 to June 1997. They were given either 100,000 IU of vitamin D (treated group n = 33) or a placebo (control group n = 35) in October, January and April. Serum calcium, phosphate, 25(OH)D and iPTH levels were measured at inclusion and every three months thereafter.\\n                At inclusion, plasma or serum 25(OH)D levels were < or = 10 ng/mL in 16 subjects and < 6 ng/mL in six. In control children, no significant change in 25(OH)D occurred during the study, while plasma or serum iPTH levels increased to 34 +/- 11 pg/mL. In the treated groups, 25(OH)D levels remained > 20 ng/mL in every subject; no hypercalcemia was observed; and the mean plasma or serum iPTH level was 25 +/- 14 pg/mL at the end of the study.\\n                Teenagers presented with a high prevalence of biological vitamin D deficiency at the end of summer. The increase of iPTH during winter in the unsupplemented group suggests that this has secondary consequences on their calcium homeostasis unless they are supplemented with vitamin D. We advocate a sufficient calcium supply and a 100,000 IU vitamin D supplement given two or three times during winter to preadolescents and adolescents living in northern France.'\n 'Rickets was investigated in 860 children in the 3 to 36 month age group in 21 villages attached to Sinik Health Centre, in northeastern Turkey. The blood calcium, phosphorus and alkaline phosphatase levels of suspect cases were determined following examination and wrist x-rays taken. The prevalence of cross-sectional rickets was determined, in the cohort group formed by removing the rickets cases (to the first group, advice was not given; to the second, 400 IU of vitamin D) and its incidence determined. The prevalence of rickets was calculated as 9.8% with no distinction observed between males and females (P > 0.05). It is higher in children in the 3-6 month group (23.97%) (P < 0.05); exposed rarely to the sun (P < 0.001); without fish in diet (P < 0.01); born to mother under 18 years old (P < 0.001); with a mother not using contraception (P < 0.01). The prevalence of acute respiratory infections (ARI) was calculated as 47.62% and 35.70% (P < 0.05) in children with and without rickets, respectively. The prevalence of enteritis was calculated as 29.76% and 18.43% (P < 0.05) in children with rickets and without rickets, respectively. Rickets was not seen where 400 IU of vitamin D was administered, while incidence for the twelve-month period was calculated as 3.8% in the other group. Combatting rickets is important in developing countries where deaths under five years are largely due to ARI and enteritis.']",
         "There a only few studies on the prevention of nutritional rickets in term born children. Until new data become available, it appears sound to offer preventive measures (vitamin D or calcium) to groups of high risk, like infants and toddlers; children living in Africa, Asia or the Middle East or migrated children from these regions into areas where rickets is not frequent. Due to a marked clinical heterogeneity and the scarcity of data, the main and adverse effects of preventive measures against nutritional rickets should be investigated in different countries, different age groups and in children of different ethnic origin."

         "All treatments evaluated within the included studies are effective. Benzodiazepines, however, have the potential to cause respiratory depression, probably midazolam more so than lorazepam, and use of this group of drugs outside of services fully confident of observing for and managing the consequences of respiratory distress is difficult to justify. Haloperidol used on its own is at such risk of generating preventable adverse effects that unless it is the only choice, this evidence directs that this sole treatment should be avoided. Olanzapine IM is valuable when compared with haloperidol plus promethazine but its duration of action is short and re-injection is frequently needed. Haloperidol plus promethazine used in two diverse situations in Brazil and India has much evidence to support its swift and safe clinically valuable effects."

         "['The efficacy of nasal oxygen during sleep was evaluated in patients with COPD, episodic rapid eye movement sleep desaturation, and a daytime PaO2 greater than 60 mm Hg. The double-blind, randomized 3-yr trial used nasal oxygen versus room air in two groups of nocturnal sleep desaturating subjects. The setting was the outpatient chest clinic of a Veterans Affairs Medical Center. There were 51 patients with moderate to severe COPD, daytime PaO2 greater than or equal to 60 mm Hg: 38 with proven REM sleep desaturation and 13 without desaturation. Nocturnal oxygen at 3 L/min was delivered by concentrator to 19 desaturating subjects, and room air at 3 L/min was delivered by defective concentrator to the remaining 19 desaturating subjects. There was no gas therapy for the 13 nondesaturating subjects. The nocturnal desaturator group who received supplemental oxygen during sleep over 36 months showed a significant downward trend in pulmonary artery pressure (-3.7 mm Hg) compared with desaturating patients treated with room air (+3.9 mm Hg). Nonvascular parameters of hypoxia, such as hemoglobin and red blood cell mass, did not differ between the sham- and oxygen-treated groups. Mortality was decidedly higher in the desaturating patients compared with non-desaturating subjects, but there was no significant difference between oxygen- and sham-treated desaturating subjects. We conclude that nasal supplemental oxygen used during sleep to reverse episodic desaturation in COPD patients whose daytime PaO2 is above 60 mm Hg has a beneficial effect in reducing pulmonary artery pressure.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)'\n 'To date only two controlled studies have been published on the effects of domiciliary oxygen treatment on survival in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) with advanced respiratory failure. The survival in such patients despite oxygen treatment remains poor. The prescription of long term oxygen therapy (LTOT) in less severe disease remains controversial. The aim of this study was to evaluate the rationale for prescribing oxygen to patients with COPD with moderate hypoxaemia.\\n                One hundred and thirty five patients with COPD, with PaO2 7.4-8.7 kPa (56-65 mmHg) and advanced airflow limitation (mean (SD) forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) 0.83 (0.28) 1), were randomly allocated to a control (n = 67) and LTOT (n = 68) group. The patients were followed every three months for at least three years or until death.\\n                The cumulative survival rate was 88% at one year, 77% at two years, and 66% at three years. No significant differences were found in survival rates between patients treated with LTOT and controls, nor did longer oxygen use (over 15 hours per day) improve survival. Younger age, better spirometric values, and higher body mass index predicted better survival.\\n                Domiciliary oxygen treatment does not prolong survival in patients with COPD with moderate hypoxaemia. Airway limitation seems to determine survival in this group of patients.'\n 'Respiratory muscle weakness is one of the most important causes of hypercapnia in patients with COPD. There is evidence that stable hypercapnic patients will benefit from long-term oxygen therapy (LTOT).\\n                The prognostic role of reversible hypercapnia in COPD is still unclear. Early implementation of LTOT in these patients may influence endurance time and mortality.\\n                In this pilot study, we investigated 28 patients (26 males, 49-74 years) with COPD, advanced airflow limitation [forced expiratory volume in 1 s (percentage of predicted value) 40.8 +/- 10.2] and mild hypoxaemia (pO(2) 66.5 +/- 6.3 mm Hg). All patients had developed a moderate reversible hypercapnia during an acute exacerbation or during exercise testing (peak pCO(2) 48.0 +/- 2.5 mm Hg). Patients were allocated randomly to a control group (n = 14) or an LTOT group (n = 14). The two groups were well matched in terms of physiological data. Lung function, endurance time (cycle ergometer), dyspnoea score, blood gases and LTOT compliance were measured at baseline and every 6 months over a period of 3 years.\\n                Endurance time increased from 6.4 +/- 2.7 min at baseline to 7.1 +/- 2.7 min after 1 year in the LTOT group and decreased from 6.1 +/- 3.0 to 4.9 +/- 3.8 min in the controls (p < 0.05). After 1 year, the end-exercise dyspnoea score was significantly lower in the LTOT group (4.5 +/- 1.5) than in the controls (5.7 +/- 1.9).\\n                COPD patients with reversible hypercapnia and mild hypoxaemia benefit from LTOT in terms of endurance time and a reduction of exertional dyspnoea after 1 year.\\n                Copyright 2004 S. Karger AG, Basel'\n 'The beneficial effects of nocturnal oxygen therapy (NOT) in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients with mild-to-moderate daytime hypoxaemia (arterial oxygen tension (Pa,O2) in the range 7.4-9.2 kPa (56-69 mmHg)) and exhibiting sleep-related oxygen desaturation remains controversial. The effectiveness of NOT in that category of COPD patients was studied. The end points included pulmonary haemodynamic effects after 2 yrs of follow-up, survival and requirement for long-term oxygen therapy (LTOT). Seventy-six patients could be randomized, 41 were allocated to NOT and 35 to no NOT (control). The goal of NOT was to achieve an arterial oxygen saturation of >90% throughout the night. All these patients underwent polysomnography to exclude an associated obstructive sleep apnoea syndrome. The two groups exhibited an identical meansD daytime Pa,O2 of 8.4+/-0.4 kPa (63+/-3 mmHg) at baseline. Twenty-two patients (12 in the NOT group and 10 in the control group, p=0.98) required LTOT during the whole follow-up (35+/-14 months). Sixteen patients died, nine in the NOT group and seven in the control group (p=0.84). Forty-six patients were able to undergo pulmonary haemodynamic re-evaluation after 2 yrs, 24 in the NOT and 22 in the control group. In the control group, mean resting pulmonary artery pressure increased from 19.8+/-5.6 to 20.5+6.5 mmHg, which was not different from the change in mean pulmonary artery pressure in the NOT group, from 18.3+/-4.7 to 19.5+/-5.3 mmHg (p= 0.79). Nocturnal oxygen therapy did not modify the evolution of pulmonary haemodynamics and did not allow delay in the prescription of long-term oxygen therapy. No effect of NOT on survival was observed, but the small number of deaths precluded any firm conclusion. These results suggest that the prescription of nocturnal oxygen therapy in isolation is probably not justified in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease patients.']",
         "Long-term home oxygen therapy improved survival in a selected group of COPD patients with severe hypoxaemia (arterial PaO2 less than 55 mm Hg (8.0 kPa)).

         "['We investigated the effect of an endoscopically placed gastric balloon, the Garren-Edwards gastric bubble (GEGB), on weight loss in obese patients. Fifty-nine obese patients were entered into a prospective double-blind study and randomized into two groups. In one group (34 patients) the GEGB was inserted, and in the other group (25 patients) a sham insertion was done. All patients participated in a standard weight loss program consisting of dietary therapy, behavior modification, and physical exercise. The bubble was removed endoscopically after 3 months from both groups. Patients were followed for an additional 9 months after bubble removal and weight loss was monitored. Weight loss was the same in both groups at 3 months (18.7 lb vs. 17.2 lb). This was true whether determined by change in pounds, percentage of body weight, or body mass index. We concluded that the GEGB was of no added benefit as compared with sham insertion, when combined with a standard weight loss program. Because of the lack of proven efficacy and the relatively high cost, we recommend that such devices be restricted to controlled studies until significant benefits are proven.'\n \"Prior efforts to treat obesity with intragastric balloons were thwarted by high complication rates. Therefore, fundamental requirements for optimal balloon designs were defined. The aim of the present study was to investigate the effectiveness, the safety, and the tolerance of a new intragastric balloon.\\n                Adults with treatment-resistant obesity and no GI contraindications to balloon placement were invited to participate in a randomized, double-blind trial of balloon or sham treatment of 3 months' duration. Patients (sham- and balloon-treated groups) in whom a preset weight-loss goal was achieved were given an additional 9 months of balloon treatment. After removal of the balloon at year 1, patients were followed for a second year without the balloon.\\n                Forty-three treatment-resistant patients (mean body mass index 43.3 kg/m 2) were enrolled. Five patients did not meet the preset weight-loss goal (nonresponse 11.6%). Three patients did not tolerate the balloon (7.0%), with endoscopy demonstrating severe esophagitis. Three other patients developed esophagitis that was related to use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, albeit prohibited (2 patients), or substantial weight loss with balloon treatment (1). In intention-to-treat analysis, sham- and balloon-treated groups had a similar mean weight loss of 11.2 kg (9.0%) and 12.9 kg (10.4%), respectively, during the first 3 months. During months 3 to 6, patients who had sham therapy in months 0 to 3 lost 8.8 kg (7.9%) during the first 3 months of balloon treatment. In contrast, patients in the balloon-treatment group lost 3.9 kg (3.5%) during months 3 to 6 (their second balloon treatment period). The overall weight loss was 20 kg (16.1%) and 16.7 kg (13.4%) after 6 months in the sham/balloon and in the balloon/balloon treated groups (not significant), respectively. After 1-year of balloon treatment, a mean weight loss of 21.3 kg (17.1%) was achieved in all patients, of which 12.6 kg (9.9%) was maintained at the end of the second balloon-free year; 47% of patients sustained a greater than 10% weight loss, with considerably reduced comorbidity. In 33 patients who completed the study per protocol, weight loss was 25.6 kg (20.5%) after 1 year and 14.6 kg (11.4%) after 2 years; 55% maintained a weight loss of greater than 10%. Interventional complications occurred in 1.6% (2/128) and balloon deflations in 2.3% (3/128).\\n                For patients with treatment-resistant obesity, the intragastric balloon appeared to be safe but was not a treatment option in a fifth of patients. Although an independent benefit of balloon treatment beyond diet, exercise, and behavioral therapy could not be demonstrated in the first 3 months, balloon treatment for 1 year resulted in substantial weight loss, the greater part of which was maintained during the balloon-free second year.\"\n 'Since its approval by the Food and Drug Administration in September 1985, the Garren-Edwards gastric bubble has been extensively used as an adjunct to diet and behavioral modification in the treatment of exogenous obesity. In an attempt to evaluate the efficacy of the Garren-Edwards gastric bubble, a double-blind crossover study was undertaken. Ninety patients were randomized into three groups: bubble-sham, sham-bubble, and bubble-bubble in two successive 12-wk periods. Sixty-one patients completed the entire 24-wk study. All groups participated in ongoing diet and behavioral modification therapy in a free-standing obesity program, the members of which were blinded to randomization arms. All patient groups lost weight during this study. The mean cumulative weight loss in pounds at 12 wk was as follows: bubble-sham = 19, sham-bubble = 12, and bubble-bubble = 8; and at 24 wk: bubble-sham = 23, sham-bubble = 16, and bubble-bubble = 18. The mean cumulative change in body mass index (kg/m2) at 12 wk was as follows: bubble-sham = -3.1, sham-bubble = -2.3, and bubble-bubble = -2.9; and at 24 wk: bubble-sham = -3.1, sham-bubble = -3.0, and bubble-bubble = -3.3. Although weight loss occurred more consistently in patients with a Garren-Edwards gastric bubble, there were no significant differences between any of the three groups at 12 or 24 wk with respect to weight loss or change in body mass index. The major part of the weight loss noted during this study occurred during the first 12-wk period, irrespective of therapy (bubble or sham). Side effects observed during this study included gastric erosions (26%), gastric ulcers (14%), small bowel obstruction (2%), Mallory-Weiss tears (11%), and esophageal laceration (1%). We conclude that, in this study, the use of a Garren-Edwards gastric bubble did not result in significantly more weight loss than diet and behavioral modification alone in the management of exogenous obesity, and it may result in significant morbidity.'\n \"A prolonged randomized, prospective, double-blind, crossover study, including a sham-sham-treated group, was undertaken to evaluate the efficacy and safety of a 500-mL gastric bubble (Ballobes; DOT ApS, RÃ¶dovre, Denmark) as an adjunct to diet, physical training, and behavioral modification. Only supermorbidly obese patients who fulfilled the usual criteria for surgery were admitted. A weight loss of 38 kg in the first 17 weeks and another 12 kg in the second 18 weeks could be achieved. The body mass index, the percentage of overweight and the loss in percentage of initial weight, paralleled this impressive weight loss. In the second period, a plateau effect occurred after the massive changes in the first period, and only one third of the changes in all parameters was seen. Stratification into a sham-sham, sham-balloon, balloon-sham, and balloon-balloon group did not show any statistical difference for all parameters between the four groups. The double-blind nature of the study was affirmed by the patient's correct judgment of the presence or absence of a balloon in only 21% of the balloon and 44% of the sham procedures. Gastrointestinal complications were infrequent and consisted of erosions (three patients), asymptomatic reflux oesophagitis (one patient), and asymptomatic gastric ulcer (one patient). Only the latter patient had elevated gastrin levels. One patient could not tolerate the balloon. All balloons remained airtight during both parts of the study for a mean of 123 days. This study confirmed the safety of the balloon, but no additional benefit could be ascribed to the balloon compared with a very low-calorie diet and medical and dietary support.\"\n \"The mechanism by which intragastric balloons induce weight loss is not known, although they may act simply by reducing the amount of food needed to induce satiety. The knowledge that a balloon is present may influence the patients' eating patterns and reduce caloric intake and weight. In order to test whether the balloon or the secondary psychological effect caused weight loss, a double blind balloon versus sham procedure was devised with both groups receiving identical outpatient dietary advice (800 kcal/day). Twenty four obese women with body mass index greater than 30 kg/m2 from an obesity clinic were studied. Twelve had the balloon and 12 the sham procedure. The balloon was removed after three months and the patients were followed for a further three months. There was significantly greater weight loss in the balloon group, mean weight loss (SD) of 7.33 (6.12) kg compared with the sham group, mean weight loss (SD) of 3.33 (3.9) kg (p less than 0.05). Weight loss was not maintained in all patients after balloon removal. Side effects were more common in the balloon group (abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting) but resolved by the second week. We conclude that the intragastric balloon is a safe and effective method of inducing weight loss in well motivated obese patients.\"\n 'In spite of the widespread use of the Garren-Edwards gastric bubble as an adjuvant device in weight reduction, its efficacy has not been established. Therefore, our purpose was to conduct a randomized, double-blind, crossover study of this device in the management of exogenous obesity. The study group consisted of 23 patients, 21 women and 2 men, ranging in age from 21 to 53 yr. Patients were 25%-111% above their ideal body weight. They were studied for 24 wk, consisting of two separate 12-wk evaluation periods. Patients were randomly assigned either to receive the gastric bubble or to have a sham procedure. After the first 12-wk evaluation period, the gastric bubble and sham were administered in crossover fashion, so that those who had received the gastric bubble initially received the sham later and vice versa. The study coordinator remained blind to the kind of treatment, weighed each patient biweekly, enforced dietary counseling, and provided behavior modification. Those who had passed or were found to have a deflated bubble at the end of the treatment period were excluded from the study. Mean weight reduction in the two evaluation periods did not differ significantly. Patients lost 5.4 +/- 1.7 kg (mean +/- SE) during the gastric bubble period and 5.20 +/- 0.8 kg during the sham period. The order of administration of the gastric bubble and sham did not significantly affect the result. The time-course of mean biweekly values, however, revealed that with the gastric bubble, weight loss was significantly greater only during first (p less than 0.005) and second (p less than 0.025) 2-wk evaluation periods. This difference, however, disappeared after the initial 4 wk of treatment. These observations suggest that although gastric bubble implantation reduced weight significantly more than the sham procedure initially, the mean weight loss during 12 wk of evaluation was not different between the two periods. In our opinion, the gastric bubble is of no value as an adjuvant device in weight reduction.']",
         "Evidence from this review is limited for decision making, since there was large heterogeneity in IGB trials, regarding both methodological and clinical aspects. However, a co-adjuvant factor described by some authors in the loss and maintenance of weight has been the motivation and the encouragement to changing eating habits following a well-organized diet and a program of behavioural modification. The IGB alone and the technique of positioning appear to be safe. Despite the evidence for little additional benefit of the intragastric balloon in the loss of weight, its cost should be considered against a program of eating and behavioural modification."

This program was developed by an interdisciplinary project group to improve knowledge, coping, treatment outcome, emotional and practical adaptation to the condition.\\n                A prospective, controlled, multi-center, pre-post study design was used to examine the efficacy of the program in the treatment group compared to the waiting group (control group). Questionnaires included epilepsy specific scales regarding knowledge, attitudes, restrictions in daily living, epilepsy related fears, coping with the chronic disease and generic instruments (quality of life, KINDL). 55 parents of the treatment group completed the questionnaires three months before the course and three months later; the corresponding waiting group included 48 parents. Respectively, 31 children, who participated in the program, completed the questionnaires immediately before the course and three months later; the corresponding waiting group included 19 children.\\n                Children, who attended the program, showed improvements in the domains perceived restrictions (significant, medium effect size), absence from school and seizure frequency. Not significantly greater compared to the control group were the improvements of knowledge, attitudes and fears regarding to the epilepsy. Parents of the treatment group showed significant enhancements in epilepsy specific knowledge (large effect size), attitudes toward the epilepsy, management of epileptic seizures and significant reductions of fears and restrictions of their child with epilepsy (small to medium effect sizes).'\n \"A randomized field trial of a child-centered model of training for self-management of chronic illnesses was conducted of 355 Spanish-speaking school-aged children, between 6 and 15 years old, with moderate to severe asthma and epilepsy, in Buenos Aires, Argentina. The model, based on play techniques, consists of five weekly meetings of 8-10 families, with children's and parents' groups held simultaneously, coordinated by specially trained teachers and outside the hospital environment. Children are trained to assume a leading role in the management of their health; parents learn to be facilitators; and physicians provide guidance, acting as counselors. Group activities include games, drawings, stories, videos, and role-playing. Children and parents were interviewed at home before the program and 6 and 12 months after the program, and medical and school records were monitored for emergency and routine visits, hospitalizations, and school absenteeism. In asthma and epilepsy, children in the experiment showed significant improvements in knowledge, beliefs, attitudes, and behaviors compared to controls (probability of experimental gain over controls = .69 for epilepsy and .56 for asthma, with sigma2 = .007 and .016, respectively). Parent participants in the experiment had improved knowledge of asthma (39% before vs. 58% after) and epilepsy (22% before vs. 56% after), with a probability of gain = .62 (sigma2 = .0026) with respect to the control group. Similar positive outcomes were found in fears of child death (experimental 39% before vs. 4% after for asthma, 69% before vs. 30% after for epilepsy), as well as in disruption of family life and patient-physician relationship, while controls showed no change. Regarding clinical variables, for both asthma and epilepsy, children in the experimental group had significantly fewer crises than the controls after the groups (P = .036 and P = .026). Visits to physicians showed a significant decrease for those with asthma (P = .048), and emergency visits decreased for those with epilepsy (P = .046). An 18-item Children Health Locus of Control Scale (CHLCS) showed a significant increase in internality in experimental group children with asthma and epilepsy (P < .01), while controls did not change or performed worse 12 months after the program. School absenteeism was reduced significantly for those with asthma and epilepsy (for the group with asthma, fall/winter P = .006, and spring P = .029; for the group with epilepsy, P = .011).\\n                The program was successful in improving the health, activity, and quality of life of children with asthma and epilepsy. The data suggested that an autonomous (Piagetian) model of training is a key to this success, reinforcing children's autonomous decision making.\"\n \"A randomized, controlled trial was conducted in Santiago, Chile to test the impact of a child-centered, family-focused educational program for children aged 7-14 years with epilepsy and for their parents. The objectives of the program developed and pilot-tested in Los Angeles, California were to increase the children's knowledge, perceptions of competency, and skills related to dealing with seizures. Children in the experimental group (n = 123) and their parents separately attended four 1 1/2-h sessions and then met together at the end of each session to share learning experiences. Control children (n = 113) and their parents attended three 2-h sessions with a traditional lecture followed by question-and-answer format. All participants were pretested and then retested 5 months after completion of the educational intervention. Although there was some knowledge increase among children in the control group, the knowledge of children in the experimental group was significantly enhanced in a variety of areas related to management of their seizures and unnecessary restriction of their social and play activities. There was a significant increase in the self-perceptions of social competency of children in the experimental group. Children in the experimental group without serious behavioral problems also reported significantly better behavior after the intervention than did control children. There was no impact on children's disclosure of their diagnosis to friends and others.\"\n \"A randomized controlled trial was conducted in Santiago, Chile to test the efficacy of the Children's Epilepsy Program, a child-centered, family-focused intervention developed and pilot tested in Los Angeles, CA, U.S.A., using a counseling model for parents of children with seizure disorders to help them (a) deal with their anger, resentment, and grief related to the loss of a normal child; (b) increase their knowledge about caring for their child; (c) reduce anxieties related to having a child with a seizure disorder; and (d) improve their decision-making skills. All parents were pretested and then retested 5 months after the educational interventions. Parents in the experimental group (n = 185) and their children separately attended four 1 1/2-h sessions and then met together at the end of each session to share learning experiences. Comparison group parents (n = 180) and their children jointly attended three 2-h lecture sessions followed by question-and-answer periods. Although parents' overall knowledge of epilepsy was relatively high initially, it improved considerably in both comparison and experimental groups. With regard to anxiety, at the 5-month evaluation, experimental group parents and mothers in particular were more likely than control parents to state that they were less anxious (p less than 0.001), and their anxiety, as measured by the Taylor Manifest Anxiety scale, was significantly reduced (p less than 0.01).\"]",
         "While each of the programmes in this review showed some benefit to children with epilepsy their impacts were extremely variable. No programme showed benefits across the full range of outcomes. No study appears to have demonstrated any detrimental effects but the evidence in favour of any single programme is insufficient to make it possible to recommend one programme rather than another. More trials, carried out by independent research teams, are needed."

The aided language stimulation program comprised 3 activities: arts and crafts, food preparation, and story time activity. Each activity was repeated over the duration of 5 subsequent sessions. Eight target vocabulary items were taught within each activity. The acquisition of all 24 target items was probed throughout the duration of the 3-week intervention period.\\n                The frequency and nature of the aided language stimulation provided met the criterion of being used 70% of the time and providing aided language stimulation with an 80:20 ratio of statements to questions. The results indicated that all 4 participants acquired the target vocabulary items. There were, however, variations in the rate of acquisition.\\n                This study explores the impact of aided language stimulation on vocabulary acquisition in children. The most important clinical implication of this study is that a 3-week intervention program in aided language stimulation was sufficient to facilitate the comprehension of at least 24 vocabulary items in 4 children with LNFS.'\n 'This study investigated the generalization of spontaneous complex language behavior across a nontraining setting and the durability of generalization as a result of programming and \"loose training\" strategy. A within-subject, across-behaviors multiple-baseline design was used to examine the performance of two moderately retarded students in the use of is/are across three syntactic structures (i.e., \"wh\" questions, \"yes/no\" reversal questions, and statements). The language training procedure used in this study represented a functional example of programming \"loose training.\" The procedure involved conducting concurrent language training within the context of an academic training task, and establishing a functional reduction in stimulus control by permitting the student to initiate a language response based on a wide array of naturally occurring stimulus events. Concurrent probes were conducted in the free play setting to assess the immediate generalization and the durability of the language behaviors. The results demonstrated that \"loose training\" was effective in establishing a specific set of language responses with the participants of this investigation. Further, both students demonstrated spontaneous use of the language behavior in the free play generalization setting and a trend was clearly evident for generalization to continue across time. Thus, the methods used appear to be successful for training the use of is/are in three syntactic structures.'\n \"To investigate whether It Takes Two to Talk-The Hanen Program for Parents of Preschool Children With Cerebral Palsy is associated with change in interaction between children who have motor disorders and their parents.\\n                Eleven children aged 19-36 months who had nonprogressive motor disorders that affected their communication, and their mothers, were observed 4 months and 1 month before mothers attended It Takes Two to Talk training, and 1 month and 4 months after its completion.\\n                Interaction patterns were stable prior to training. After training, mothers initiated less and produced more responses and fewer requests. Children produced more initiations, as well as more requests and provisions of information, after training. Mothers' linguistic input did not change in amount or complexity. Changes were maintained 4 months later. Mothers' views of parenting did not change.\\n                It Takes Two to Talk may be associated with positive communication change for this group.

Group characteristics were as follows: seven males, nine females; age range 12 to 18 years (mean 14y, SD 2); CP type: nine spastic, two dyskinetic, four mixed, one Worster-Drought; Gross Motor Function Classification System levels range I to V (median IV). Children received three 30- to 45-minute sessions of individual therapy per week for 6 weeks. Intelligibility in single words and connected speech was compared across four points: 1 week and 6 weeks before therapy, and 1 week and 6 weeks after its completion.

Mean percentage intelligibility was compared using general linear modelling techniques.\\n                After treatment, familiar listeners understood 14.7% more single words and 12.1% more words in connected speech. Unfamiliar listeners understood 15% more single words and 15.9% more words in connected speech after therapy.\\n                Therapy was associated with increases in speech intelligibility.

Nineteen participants and 10 comparison staff were filmed before and after a five-session training workshop, interacting in the classroom in naturally occurring situations with a non-speaking physically disabled child. Significant improvements in the quality of adults' facilitation of the children's communication was discernible at follow-up, four months after completion of the training. However, teachers were found to alter their behaviour more quickly after training than non-teaching staff.

Three communication functions were identified for each child and intervention goals to replace or enhance the child's existing prelinguistic behaviours were developed in consultation with parents. After a baseline phase, parents received training on implementation of FCT. Intervention was staggered across the three communicative functions in a multiple-probe design.\\n                Intervention was associated with increases in the replacement communication behaviour. Treatment gains were generally maintained at the monthly follow-ups.\\n                The results suggest that parents can use FCT to enhance communication skills in children with developmental and physical disabilities.\"\n 'This study compared training in two language systems for three severely handicapped, nonvocal adolescents: the Bliss symbol system and an iconic picture system. Following baseline, training and review trials were implemented using an alternating treatments design. Daily probes were conducted to assess maintenance, stimulus generalization, and response generalization, and data were collected on spontaneous usage of either language system throughout the school day. Results showed that students required approximately four times as many trials to acquire Bliss symbols as iconic pictures, and that students maintained a higher percentage of iconic pictures. Stimulus generalization occurred in both language systems, while the number of correct responses during responses generalization probes was much greater for the iconic system. Finally, students almost always showed more iconic responses than Bliss responses in daily spontaneous usage. These results suggest that an iconic system might be more readily spontaneous usage. These results suggest than an iconic system might be more readily acquired, maintained, and generalized to daily situations. Implications of these findings for the newly verbal person were discussed.']",
         "Firm evidence of the positive effects of SLT for children with cerebral palsy has not been demonstrated by this review. However, positive trends in communication change were shown. No change in practice is recommended from this updated review. Further research is needed to describe this client group, and its possible clinical subgroups, and the methods of treatment currently used in SLT. Research is also needed to investigate the effectiveness of new and established interventions and their acceptability to families. Rigour in research practice needs to be extended to enable firm associations between therapy and the communication change to be made. There are now sufficient data to develop randomised controlled studies of dysarthria interventions and group parent training programmes. Such research is urgently needed to ensure clinically effective provision for this group of children, who are at severe risk of social and educational exclusion."

Daily symptom scores did not show significant differences between the treatments but parental preferences indicated that both sodium cromoglycate and ipratropium bromide were superior to placebo. Sodium cromoglycate was prophylactic and was more likely to help the older patients. Ipratropium bromide produced an immediate clinical benefit and the response was not age dependent. We were unable to pick responders from non-responders on the basis of lung function tests performed on a routine outpatient basis. Both ipratropium bromide and sodium cromoglycate help some but not all asthmatic children aged less than 2 years.'\n 'nan'\n \"Sixteen children aged under 5 years with chronic asthma completed a double-blind crossover trial of treatment with oral choline theophyllinate (6.7 mg/kg four times daily) and nebulised sodium cromoglycate (20 mg four times daily). The trial comprised three 8-week treatment periods during which active sodium cromoglycate, active choline theophyllinate, and placebo were given in random order. Symptom scores for sleep disturbance, cough, wheeze, and daily activities were similar during the three treatment periods if results were analysed using Friedman's non-parametric analysis of variance. However the Mantel-Haenszel test showed that sodium cromoglycate was superior to placebo (P less than 0.05) in maintaining normal daily activities. Either regimen is safe and well tolerated by young children.\"\n \"Eleven children with severe perennial asthma and a poor clinical response to disodium cromoglycate were studied in a 4-month, double blind trial involving 1 month's treatment with placebo, disodium cromoglycate, betamethasone 17 valerate, and both drugs combined according to a predetermined random design. Each drug apparently reduced symptoms and improved daily peak flow and fortnightly spirometric measurements compared with placebo, but the improvement after betamethasone 17 valerate was greater in part because of the way this group of patients was selected. There did not appear to be any additional benefit when both drugs were used together. Betamethasone 17 valerate was not compared with beclomethasone diproprionate aerosol and there is no reason to believe it may be superior. Corticosteroid aerosols have potential hazards which may prove to equal those of long-term systemic steroids, but they offer the prospect of satisfactory control of symptoms without the risk of growth suppression in children with severe asthma. Disodium cromoglycate remains the drug of choice in severe childhood asthma and the use of corticosteroid aerosols should be confined to those children who fail to respond satisfactorily to disodium cromoglycate.\"\n 'Seventeen asthmatic children under 5 years of age took part in a double-blind controlled trial of nebulized sodium cromoglycate solution. Daily symptom scores kept by the parents showed improvement in 11 children during active treatment, and a significant improvement in scores for cough by day and night was obtained for the group as a whole.'\n 'The efficacy of nebulised sodium cromoglycate (SCG) used as a prophylactic treatment of wheezy bronchitis in children aged 1 to 4 years was evaluated in a multicentre double-blind placebo controlled, group comparative study. Fifty-four patients completed the 10-week trial (29 treated with SCG and 25 treated with placebo), preceded by 4-8 weeks baseline. Nebulised SCG did not prove significantly superior to placebo in reducing day wheezing, day coughing, or sleep disturbance due to wheezing or coughing at night. Neither was there significant difference in the use of supportive medicine (beta 2-agonist and theophylline) between the groups. Extra doctor visits, hospital admissions, and parental preference did not show significant difference either.'\n 'nan'\n 'Inhalation therapy with sodium cromoglycate is recommended as the first-line prophylactic treatment for moderate asthma in children. The availability of spacer devices with face-masks has extended the applicability of metered-dose inhalers to younger children. We studied the feasibility and effects of this therapy compared with placebo in children aged 1-4 years.\\n                218 children aged 1-4 years with moderate asthma were recruited through 151 general practitioners between March, 1995, and March, 1996. They were randomly assigned sodium cromoglycate (10 mg three times daily) or placebo, given by inhaler with spacer device and face-mask for 5 months. Rescue medication (ipratropium plus fenoterol aerosol) was available during the baseline period of 1 month and the intervention period. Parents completed a daily symptom-score list. The primary outcome measure was the proportion of symptom-free days in months 2 to 5. Analysis was by both intention to treat and on treatment.\\n                167 (77%) children completed the trial. 131 (78%) of these children used at least 80% of the recommended dose. Of the 51 children who stopped prematurely, 23 had difficulties with inhaled treatment. The mean proportion of symptom-free days for both groups was greater for the treatment period than for the baseline period (95% CI for mean difference 5.1 to 17.5 cromoglycate, 11.9 to 23.3 placebo). However there were no differences between the sodium cromoglycate and placebo groups in the proportion of symptom-free days (mean 65.7 [SD 25.3] vs 64.3 [24.5]%; 95% CI for difference -8.46 to 5.70) or in any other outcome measure.\\n                Our study in a general practice setting shows that inhalation therapy with a spacer device and face-mask is feasible in a majority of children below the age of 4 years. However, long-term prophylactic therapy with inhaled sodium cromoglycate is not more effective than placebo in this age-group.'\n 'nan' 'nan'\n 'A prospective study was undertaken to evaluate the efficacy of (sodium) cromoglycate in the treatment of persistent wheezing in 31 children between 4 and 12 months of age. The subjects were randomised to receive either 40 mg of cromoglycate (n = 16) or physiological saline as placebo (n = 15) three times a day by wet nebulisation in a double blind fashion for a period of six weeks. The patients were evaluated with daily symptom scores and respiratory function testing measuring maximal expiratory flow at functional residual capacity (VmaxFRC) before initiating treatment and upon completion. At baseline, mean (SD) symptom scores between the two groups were comparable (cromoglycate 99.5 (29.8), placebo 104.5 (29.7)) as were VmaxFRC expressed as per cent of predicted normals (cromoglycate 48 (28), placebo 46 (20)). Upon completion of the treatment protocol, no significant difference could be found between the two groups for either symptom score (cromoglycate 67.6 (40.2), placebo 58.6 (41.4)), or VmaxFRC (cromoglycate 52 (24), placebo 60 (32)). It is concluded, therefore, that 40 mg of cromoglycate three times a day administered via facemask and wet nebulisation was no more effective than placebo in the treatment of our sample of persistently wheezing infants under 1 year of age.'\n 'nan']",

         "['140 children of 184 with acute asthma entered a randomised double-blind trial of oral prednisolone (n = 67) compared with placebo (n = 73) administered soon after admission. The dose of prednisolone was 30 mg in children under 5, otherwise 60 mg. All children also received salbutamol. All had moderate or severe dyspnoea. Initial evaluation was similar for both groups. On reassessment after a few hours 20 children in the prednisolone group were fit for discharge compared with only 2 in the placebo group. There were no early reattendances. Children remaining in hospital had a shorter median duration of stay and were less likely to require further steroid therapy if they had initially received prednisolone. In acute asthma the prompt use of a single dose of oral prednisolone can reduce morbidity and the need for hospital care.'\n \"In a randomised controlled trial 38 asthmatic children aged 2-11 yr who had not received regular oral or inhaled steroids during the previous year, were treated with a standard regime of nebulised salbutamol and intravenous aminophylline plus either hydrocortisone and oral prednisolone for 5 days, or placebo. The children were observed throughout their hospital stay and for 3 months afterwards. There was a greater fall in heart rates in the steroid treated group on the second day of treatment (mean diff. 16 beats/min) and at discharge (mean diff. 13 beats/min); p less than 0.025. Peak Expiratory Flow Rates recorded in 26 children, 13 in each group, showed more improvement on day 2 in those given steroids (mean diff 16% predicted); p less than 0.05. This difference was not apparent at discharge but 9 children treated with steroids were clinically wheeze-free when they left hospital compared with 3 in the placebo group, p less than 0.05. There were no differences in respiratory rate, pulsus paradoxus and arterial oxygen saturation. Trends in duration of hospital stay and relapse rate during the succeeding 3 months favoured active treatment. These findings support the use of systemic corticosteroids in addition to high dose bronchodilators to treat 'non steroid dependent' children hospitalised with acute severe asthma.\"\n 'The aim of this study was to assess whether nebulized budesonide may substitute for oral prednisolone in the management of children whose asthma is severe enough to warrant hospital admission, but who have no life threatening features. In a prospective, double-blind, randomized study nebulized budesonide (2 mg 8 hourly) was compared with oral prednisolone (2 mg/kg at entry and again at 24 h) in 46 children admitted to hospital with severe asthma exacerbations. Efficacy variables (including lung function measurements such as the primary outcome variable, Forced Expiratory Volume in 1 second (FEV1) and symptoms) were measured 24 h after treatment initiation. FEV1 improved significantly compared to baseline in patients who received nebulized budesonide compared to the prednislone group. The data show nebulized budesonide to be at least as effective as oral steroid in improving lung function and symptom severity in severe exacerbations of childhood asthma.'\n 'The use of oral prednisolone (2 mg/kg) to treat children admitted to hospital with acute asthma was assessed in a placebo controlled study. Children were further randomised to receive either 0.15 mg/kg salbutamol every 30 minutes for the first three hours of admission, or 5 mg salbutamol every one to four hours as needed. Treatment was double blind and the assessor was unaware of the nebuliser regimen given. Children were examined before and after treatment with salbutamol on arrival and reassessed four hours after admission. Seventy children completed the study. Seventeen (46%) of 37 children receiving prednisolone and six (9%) of 33 receiving placebo were fit for discharge after four hours of treatment. There was no significant difference between the two nebuliser regimens. Clinical parameters indicative of asthma severity were improved in all groups. Between group comparisons at reassessment showed higher peak flows in those receiving prednisolone and nebulisers every 30 minutes but differences were not significant for other parameters. Objective parameters indicating steroid efficacy over placebo were minimal. Despite this, those receiving prednisolone were more readily identifiable as being fit for discharge within four hours of treatment.'\n 'Forty-nine nonsteroid-dependent children hospitalized with status asthmaticus were randomized to receive IV placebo or methylprednisolone treatment (1 mg/kg every six hours). All patients received nebulized isoetharine inhalations and continuous IV aminophylline infusion. Twenty-four hours after admission, the methylprednisolone-treated patients demonstrated a greater rate of improvement in their clinical scoring index than did placebo-treated children. However, the duration of hospital stay was not significantly shortened. Twenty-eight of the patients performed serial bedside spirometry at 0, 12, 24, and 36 hours after admission. The methyl-prednisolone-treated patients experienced a more rapid recovery from peripheral airway obstruction as measured by forced expiratory flow rate during 25% to 75% of forced vital capacity (FEF25-75). The magnitude and rate of improvement in FEF25-75 was significantly greater at 36 hours (P less than .05) and independent of changes in peak expiratory flow rate, forced vital capacity, or forced expiratory volume in the first second of forced vital capacity. Placebo-treated patients had a higher incidence of asthma relapse within 4 weeks of discharge (eight v two relapses, P less than .05). Findings of this study indicate that IV corticosteroid therapy is beneficial in treating pediatric status asthmaticus.'\n 'Nineteen children who were not steroid dependent and were hospitalized in status asthmaticus were studied to evaluate the effect of corticosteroids. They were randomized into two groups. Each group received salbutamol inhalations and intravenous aminophylline therapy. One group received 7 mg/kg hydrocortisone intravenously every six hours; the other group served as a control. Each group showed significant improvement in clinical score and peak expiratory flow rate after 36 hours; there was no statistical difference in the degree of improvement. Six of ten steroid-treated children and six of nine controls achieved a PEFR of 50% predicted by 36 hours. The response to inhaled salbutamol was similar in each group. The results show that in the first 36 hours of therapy, corticosteroids have no additive effect on the bronchodilator response of aminophylline and salbutamol and do not hasten the recovery of nonsteroid-dependent children in status asthmaticus. Although the results show that an inhaled sympathomimetic drug is beneficial in status asthmaticus, corticosteroid therapy does not increase the responsiveness of the airways to these agents.']",
         "Systemic corticosteroids produce some improvements for children admitted to hospital with acute asthma. The benefits may include earlier discharge and fewer relapses. Inhaled or nebulised corticosteroids cannot be recommended as equivalent to systemic steroids at this time.

The 5-mg dose of rofecoxib did not differ significantly from placebo. Patients in the rofecoxib 25- and 50-mg groups showed significant improvement in key individual efficacy measurements, including patient global assessment of pain, patient and investigator global assessment of disease activity, and Stanford Health Assessment Questionnaire Disability Index (P<0.05 vs placebo). Compared with placebo, significantly fewer patients in the 25-mg and 50-mg rofecoxib groups discontinued therapy because of lack of efficacy (P = 0.02 and P = 0.032, respectively).

The primary end point was confirmed clinical upper gastrointestinal events (gastroduodenal perforation or obstruction, upper gastrointestinal bleeding, and symptomatic gastroduodenal ulcers).\\n                Rofecoxib and naproxen had similar efficacy against rheumatoid arthritis. During a median follow-up of 9.0 months, 2.1 confirmed gastrointestinal events per 100 patient-years occurred with rofecoxib, as compared with 4.5 per 100 patient-years with naproxen (relative risk, 0.5; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.3 to 0.6; P<0.001).

         "In patients with RA, rofecoxib demonstrates a greater degree of efficacy than placebo, while having a comparable safety profile. Rofecoxib demonstrates a similar degree of efficacy as naproxen, but with a significantly lower rate of ulceration and gastrointestinal bleeding. Rofecoxib was associated with a greater risk for MI, but the exact significance and pathophysiology of this possible relationship is unclear.\nRofecoxib was voluntarily withdrawn from global markets in October 2004. It cannot therefore be prescribed and therefore there are no implications for practice concerning its use. None the less when considering which NSAID to use, it must be borne in mind that the toxicity of NSAIDs is variable amongst patients and drugs and it tends to be dose related and associated with variation in the mode of action, absorption, distribution and metabolism.There remains a number of questions over both the benefits and risks associated with Cox II selective agents and further work is ongoing. It is likely that this issue will not be resolved until research has enabled a fuller understanding of the complex mechanism by which the Cox system operates."

Participants' response distances were maximal for the full biological-motion configuration and remained surprisingly long when convenient subsets of reflective markers were positioned on the pedestrian's ankles and wrists. When the pedestrian wore a reflective vest, the responses were no better than when he wore no reflective markings.

The results showed that each retroreflector configuration yielded significantly longer recognition distances than the no-retroreflector configuration. More importantly, the retroreflective markings attached to the limbs led to significantly longer (about 60-80%) recognition distances than when the retroreflective markings were attached to the torso. Furthermore, a pedestrian was more recognizable while crossing the road than while approaching the subject vehicle, except for configurations involving no retroreflective markings.\"\n \"This study quantified drivers' ability to recognize pedestrians at night. Ten young and 10 older participants drove around a closed road circuit and responded when they first recognized a pedestrian. Four pedestrian clothing and two beam conditions were tested. Results demonstrate that driver age, clothing configuration, headlamp beam, and glare all significantly affect performance. Drivers recognized only 5% of pedestrians in the most challenging condition (low beams, black clothing, glare), whereas drivers recognized 100% of the pedestrians who wore retroreflective clothing configured to depict biological motion (no glare). In the absence of glare, mean recognition distances varied from 0.0 m (older drivers, low beam, black clothing) to 220 m (722 feet; younger drivers, high beam, retroreflective biomotion). These data provide new motivation to minimize interactions between vehicular and pedestrian traffic at night and suggest garment designs to maximize pedestrian conspicuity when these interactions are unavoidable.\"]",
         "Visibility aids have the potential to increase visibility and enable drivers to detect pedestrians and cyclists earlier. Biomotion markings, which highlight the movement and form of the pedestrian, showed evidence of improving pedestrians' conspicuity at night. Public acceptability of various effective strategies which improve visibility would merit further development. However, the effect of visibility aids on pedestrian and cyclist safety remains unknown. A cluster randomised controlled trial involving large communities may provide an answer to this question. It would, however, be a challenging trial to conduct. Studies that collect data of road traffic injuries relating to the use of visibility aids also warrant consideration."

The generic quality-of-life scale showed reported physical problems were significantly reduced at 4 months, but not quite at 12 months, when the mean difference was 4.5 (95% CI = -0.2 to 9.1, P= 0.061). The improvement in psychosocial quality of life at 12 months was not significant, with a mean difference of 2.2 (95% CI = -1.9 to 6.4, P= 0.292). Parent-reported school attendance improved, but not significantly.\\n                This novel and pragmatic trial, with integrated economic evaluation, found that tailored improvement of the housing of children with moderate to severe asthma significantly increases parent-reported asthma-related quality of life and reduces physical problems. Collaborative housing initiatives have potential to improve health.\"\n 'To determine if a multi-component family focused education package is more effective than a waiting list control group in treating overweight and obese children.\\n                A 2-year randomised controlled trial; 65 overweight and obese children aged 6-14 years were allocated to active intervention in either the first or second year, with body composition monitoring alone in the control period. Anthropometric measurements were undertaken at six monthly intervals and a 7-day food and activity diary were issued.\\n                Over the 2 years of the study body mass index (BMI) SDS (z score) fell significantly in the intervention/control (I/C) group, but not in the control/intervention (C/I) group. The difference between groups was 0.3, which was borderline significant (95% confidence interval (95% CI) -0.62 to 0.02, P=0.06) before adjusting for potential confounding factors. Thirty-three percent of the I/C group and 12% of the C/I group achieved the target reduction of 0.5 BMI SDS. The I/C group had a significantly greater reduction in the percentage with a BMI above the 99.6th centile at 24 months (P=0.04) and gained 5.7 kg less over the time of the study. There were no significant differences between groups for mean percentage attendance at physical activity sessions (I/C group=24.1%, 95% CI, 15.4-32.9; C/I group=31.7%, 95% CI, 22.4-41.1, P=0.229).\\n                Children given active intervention followed by body composition monitoring alone reduced their BMI SDS, and fewer children were classified as grossly overweight by the end of the study.

A comprehensive early detection (ED) system, based on public information campaigns and low-threshold-psychosis-detecting teams, was introduced in 1 health care area (ED area), but not in a comparable area (no-ED area). Both areas ran equivalent 2-year treatment programs.\\n                First-episode patients from the ED area had a significantly lower DUP, better clinical status, and milder negative symptoms at the start of treatment. There were no differences in treatment received for the first 2 years between the groups. The difference in negative symptoms was maintained at the 1-year follow-up. There was a statistically significant difference in the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale negative component, cognitive component, and depressive component in favor of the ED group at the 2-year follow-up. Multiple linear regression analyses gave no indication that these differences were due to confounders.\\n                Reducing the DUP has effects on the course of symptoms and functioning, including negative symptoms, suggesting secondary prevention of the negative psychopathologies in first-episode schizophrenia.'\n 'To evaluate a model of intensive case management for people with dementia based in a community-based mental health service for older people.\\n                Quasi-experimental design.

Eligible older people and their carers were interviewed at uptake and again at 6 and 12 months.\\n                The impact of the scheme upon placement occurred in the second year at the end of which 51% of the experimental group remained at home compared with 33% of the comparison group. For the experimental group significant improvements in the social contacts of older people were noted; a decrease in the stress of their carers was observed, together with a reduction in their input to the care of the client; and there were significant improvements on ratings of overall need reduction, aspects of daily living and level of risk. Differences between the two groups based on service receipt showed higher costs for the experimental group.\\n                The benefits to older people and their carers confirms previous findings that the most effective case management interventions are those targeted on a highly specific client group.

To address these problems, Columbia University and the New York City Department of Education and the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene undertook a randomized controlled trial to test the efficacy of a comprehensive school-based asthma program. In this intervention, school nurses were trained to facilitate the establishment of a preventive network of care for children with asthma by coordinating communications and fostering relationships between families, PCPs, and school personnel. PCPs also received training regarding asthma management. There was limited support for this model. While case detection helped nurses identify additional students with asthma and nurses increased the amount of time spent on asthma-related tasks, PCPs did not change their medical management of asthma. Few improvements in health outcomes were achieved. Relative to controls, 12-months posttest intervention students had a reduction in activity limitations due to asthma (-35% vs -9%, p < .05) and days with symptoms (26% vs 39%, p = .06). The intervention had no impact on the use of urgent health care services, school attendance, or caregiver's quality of life. There were also no improvements at 24-months postintervention. We faced many challenges related to case detection, training, and implementing preventive care activities, which may have hindered our success. We present these challenges, describe how we coped with them, and discuss the lessons we learned.\"\n 'Intermediate care (IC) services have been widely introduced in England and have the strategic objectives of reducing hospital and long-term care use.

         "Collaboration between local health and local government is commonly considered best practice. However, the review did not identify any reliable evidence that interagency collaboration, compared to standard services, necessarily leads to health improvement. A few studies identified component benefits but these were not reflected in overall outcome scores and could have resulted from the use of significant additional resources. Although agencies appear enthusiastic about collaboration, difficulties in the primary studies and incomplete implementation of initiatives have prevented the development of a strong evidence base. If these weaknesses are addressed in future studies (for example by providing greater detail on the implementation of programmes; using more robust designs, integrated process evaluations to show how well the partners of the collaboration worked together, and measurement of health outcomes) it could provide a better understanding of what might work and why. It is possible that local collaborative partnerships delivering environmental Interventions may result in health gain but the evidence base for this is very limited.\nEvaluations of interagency collaborative arrangements face many challenges. The results demonstrate that collaborative community partnerships can be established to deliver interventions but it is important to agree goals, methods of working, monitoring and evaluation before implementation to protect programme fidelity and increase the potential for effectiveness."

         "[\"Many of those involved in palliative care have justifiable objections to the introduction of intravenous hydration in patients with dehydration-associated symptoms and advanced cancer. Researchers from the University of Buenos Aires carried out a randomized, comparative and prospective trail to determine the usefulness of hypodermoclysis in the control of thirst, chronic nausea and delirium. Forty-two patients were randomized into two groups. Both groups received drugs subcutaneously (haloperidol 2.5 mg every 4 hours to control delirium and/or metoclopramide 10 mg every 4 hours to control chronic nausea). The study group also received 1000 ml 5% dextrose in water infusion plus 140 milliequivalent per litre (mEq/L) sodium chloride, at a rate of 42 ml/hour per day. Both groups showed significant and equal improvements in relief of thirst and chronic nausea at 24 hours. After 48 hours, this improvement was maintained in the group that received hydration, but only for the relief of chronic nausea. Delirium did not improve significantly in either group during the 48-hour trial period. Current data suggest that decisions on rehydration of patients with terminal-phase cancer should be based more on the patient's comfort than on providing optimal hydration.\"\n 'This prospective study was undertaken to assess the state of hydration in terminal cancer patients with and without intravenous fluids during the last 48 hours of their lives and to correlate various measures of hydration with their state of consciousness. We examined indicators of hydration in the plasma and urine of 68 consecutive patients for whom data were available at 48 hours or less before death. Thirteen of the patients were being treated with intravenous (IV) fluids. Nearly all of the patients studied were found to be dehydrated, as determined by laboratory measurements. State of consciousness correlated inversely with serum sodium (p < 0.001) and urine osmolality (p < 0.02). Patients receiving intravenous fluids were not better hydrated than those without IV therapy, nor was their state of consciousness improved. In light of these findings, which suggest there is no clinical benefit from intravenous infusions, decisions regarding intravenous fluid therapy during the last hours of life should be guided by the preferences of the dying patient and his family.'\n 'Most patients with cancer develop decreased oral intake and dehydration before death. This study aimed to determine the effect of parenteral hydration on overall symptom control in terminally ill cancer patients with dehydration.\\n                Patients with clinical evidence of mild to moderate dehydration and a liquid oral intake less than 1,000 mL/day were randomly assigned to receive either parenteral hydration with 1,000 mL (treatment group) or placebo with 100 mL normal saline administered over 4 hours for 2 days. Patients were evaluated for target symptoms (hallucinations, myoclonus, fatigue, and sedation), global well-being, and overall benefit.\\n                Twenty-seven patients randomly assigned to the treatment group had improvement in 53 (73%) of their 73 target symptoms versus 33 (49%) of 67 target symptoms in the placebo group (n=22; P = .005). Fifteen (83%) of 18 and 15 (83%) of 18 patients had improved myoclonus and sedation after hydration versus eight (47%) of 17 and five (33%) of 15 patients after placebo (P = .035 and P = .005, respectively). There were no significant differences of improvement in hallucinations or fatigue between groups. When blinded to treatment, patients (17 [63%] of 77) and investigators (20 [74%] of 27) perceived hydration as effective compared with placebo in nine (41%) of 22 patients (P = .78) and 12 (54%) of 22 investigators (P = .15), respectively. The intensity of pain and swelling at the injection site were not significantly different between groups.\\n                Parenteral hydration decreased symptoms of dehydration in terminally ill cancer patients who had decreased fluid intake. Hydration was well tolerated, and a placebo effect was observed. Studies with larger samples and a longer follow-up period are justified.'\n 'To explore the association between hydration volume and symptoms during the last 3 weeks of life in terminally ill cancer patients.\\n                This was a multicenter, prospective, observational study of 226 consecutive terminally ill patients with abdominal malignancies. Primary responsible physicians and nurses evaluated the severity of membranous dehydration (dehydration score calculated from three physical findings), peripheral edema (edema score calculated from seven physical findings), ascites and pleural effusion (rated as physically undetectable to symptomatic), bronchial secretion, hyperactive delirium (Memorial Delirium Assessment Scale), communication capacity (Communication Capacity Scale), agitation (Agitation Distress Scale), myoclonus and bedsores.\\n                Patients were classified into two groups: the hydration group (n=59) who received 1 l or more of artificial hydration per day, 1 and 3 weeks before death, and the non-hydration group (n=167). The percentage of patients with deterioration in dehydration score in the final 3 weeks was significantly higher in the non-hydration group than the hydration group (35% versus 14%; P=0.002), while the percentages of patients whose symptom scores for edema, ascites and pleural effusion increased were significantly higher in the hydration group than the non-hydration group (44% versus 29%, P=0.039; 29% versus 8.4%, P <0.001; 15% versus 5.4%, P=0.016; respectively). After controlling for multiple covariates and treatment settings, the association between hydration group and dehydration/ascites score was statistically significant. Subgroup analysis of patients with peritoneal metastases identified statistically significant interaction between hydration group and dehydration/pleural effusion score. There were no significant differences in the degree of bronchial secretion, hyperactive delirium, communication capacity, agitation, myoclonus or bedsores.\\n                Artificial hydration therapy could alleviate membranous dehydration signs, but could worsen peripheral edema, ascites and pleural effusions. It is suggested that the potential benefits of artificial hydration therapy should be balanced with the risk of worsening fluid retention symptoms. Further clinical studies are strongly needed to identify the effects of artificial hydration therapy on overall patient well-being, and an individualized treatment and close monitoring of dehydration and fluid retention symptoms is strongly recommended.']",

         "['A randomised double-blind placebo-controlled study was designed to evaluate the effects of a semisynthetic macrolide antibiotic, clarithromycin, on bronchial hyperresponsiveness to methacholine in patients with a diagnosis of asthma. Adult asthma patients undergoing treatment with budesonide 400 microg b.i.d. and salbutamol 200 microg p.r.n. less than twice weekly were studied. Arm A (16 males/six females, aged 48 +/- 16 yrs) received clarithromycin 250 mg b.i.d. for 8 weeks, arm B (eight males/12 females, aged 42 +/- 12 yrs) clarithromycin 250 mg t.id. and arm C (six males/15 females, aged 41 +/- 16 yrs) placebo dextrose tablets. Bronchial hyperresponsiveness was quantified by measurement of the provocative dose of methacholine causing a 20% fall in forced expiratory volume in one second (PD20). Median (interquartile range) PD20 in the three groups before and after treatment with clarithromycin were: arm A: 0.3 (0.1-1) and 1.3 (0.6-2) mg; arm B: 0.4 (0.1-0.9) and 2 (2-2) mg; and arm C: 0.4 (0.1-0.9) and 0.3 (0.1-0.6) mg, respectively. Serum free cortisol levels were determined and remained unchanged from baseline in the clarithromycin-treated patients. It is concluded that clarithromycin reduces the degree of bronchial hyperresponsiveness in patients with asthma.'\n 'Troleandomycin (TAO), a macrolide antibiotic, was studied as an alternative treatment in 18 children with severe, steroid-requiring asthma.\\n                In this investigation three treatment arms were used in randomized, double-blind, parallel fashion: combination TAO and methylprednisolone (MPn), combination TAO and prednisone, and MPn alone.\\n                All groups tolerated a considerable reduction in glucocorticoid dose over the 12 weeks of the study: 80% +/- 6% for TAO-MPn, 55% +/- 8% for TAO-prednisone, and 44% +/- 14% for MPn alone. These reductions are all statistically significant (p < 0.05) within groups, and the differences between groups were statistically significant between the TAO-MPn and MPn alone groups. The concentration of methacholine required to induce a 20% decrease in forced expiratory volume in 1 second and pulmonary function were not significantly improved in any treatment group. Safety parameters including blood chemistry and hematology, adrenal function assessment; bone densitometry, and muscle strength testing, were not altered significantly. Two patients who received TAO had elevated liver enzyme levels; one required discontinuation of TAO and one experienced spontaneous resolution without intervention. Lack of statistically significant changes in the efficacy parameters were likely a result of small sample size and effects of the glucocorticoid dose taper.\\n                TAO is safe and may be a reasonable treatment alternative in a limited trial for patients who are unable to tolerate tapering of their glucocorticoid dosage. Therapy should be guided by the goal of treatment, that is, glucocorticoid dose reduction or improvement of pulmonary function with appropriate monitoring of pulmonary function and adverse effects.'\n 'An association has been reported between chronic infection with Chlamydia pneumoniae and the severity of asthma, and uncontrolled observations have suggested that treatment with antibiotics active against C. pneumoniae leads to an improvement in asthma control. We studied the effect of roxithromycin in subjects with asthma and immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies to C. pneumoniae > or = 1:64 and/or IgA antibodies > or = 1:16. A total of 232 subjects, from Australia, New Zealand, Italy, or Argentina, were randomized to 6 wk of treatment with roxithromycin 150 mg twice a day or placebo. At the end of 6 wk, the increase from baseline in evening peak expiratory flow (PEF) was 15 L/min with roxithromycin and 3 L/min with placebo (p = 0.02). With morning PEF, the increase was 14 L/min with roxithromycin and 8 L/min with placebo (NS). In the Australasian population, the increase in morning PEF was 18 L/min and 4 L/min, respectively (p = 0.04). At 3 mo and 6 mo after the end of treatment, differences between the two groups were smaller and not significant. Six weeks of treatment with roxithromycin led to improvements in asthma control but the benefit was not sustained. Further studies are necessary to determine whether the lack of sustained benefit is due to failure to eradicate C. pneumoniae.'\n 'To determine the effect of clarithromycin therapy in patients with asthma.\\n                Randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled trial.\\n                A tertiary referral center.\\n                Fifty-five subjects with chronic, stable asthma recruited from the general Denver, CO, community.\\n                Patients underwent airway evaluation for Mycoplasma pneumoniae and Chlamydia pneumoniae by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and culture, followed by treatment with clarithromycin, 500 bid, or placebo for 6 weeks.\\n                Outcome variables were lung function, sinusitis as measured by CT, and the inflammatory mediators tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, interleukin (IL)-2, IL-4, IL-5, and IL-12 messenger RNA (mRNA) measured via in situ hybridization, in airway biopsies, and BAL. Mycoplasma or chlamydia were detected by PCR in 31 of 55 asthmatics. Treatment resulted in a significant improvement in the FEV(1), but only in the PCR-positive subjects (2.50 +/- 0.16 to 2.69 +/- 0.19 L, mean +/- SEM; p = 0.05). This was not appreciated in the PCR-negative subjects (2.59 +/- 0.24 to 2.54 +/- 0.18 L, p = 0.85) or the PCR-positive or PCR-negative subjects who received placebo. Sinus CTs revealed no change in sinusitis with clarithromycin treatment. In situ hybridization revealed no significant difference in baseline airway tissue or BAL-mediator expression between the PCR-positive and PCR-negative subjects. However, the PCR-positive subjects who received clarithromycin demonstrated a reduction in TNF-alpha (p = 0.006), IL-5 (p = 0.007), and IL-12 (p = 0.004) mRNA in BAL and TNF-alpha mRNA in airway tissue (p = 0.0009). The PCR-negative subjects who received clarithromycin only demonstrated a reduction in TNF-alpha (p = 0.01) and IL-12 (p = 0.002) mRNA in BAL and TNF-alpha mRNA in airway tissue (p = 0.004). There were no significant differences in cytokine expression in those subjects who received placebo.\\n                These observations support the hypothesis that clarithromycin therapy improves lung function, but only in those subjects with positive PCR findings for M pneumoniae or C pneumoniae.'\n \"Although long-term administration of 14-membered macrolide antibiotics is a therapeutic alternative in asthma, both its pharmacologic mechanism of action and association with the pathogenesis of asthma remain obscure.\\n                This study investigated the suppressive effect of clarithromycin on airway responsiveness to methacholine provocation testing and examined whether chrarithromycin's antiasthmatic activity is associated with a reduction in eosinophilic inflammation.\\n                For 8 weeks, patients received 200 mg of clarithromycin or identical-appearing placebo twice daily. We assessed the effects of treatment with clarithromycin on bronchoconstriction precipitated by inhalation of methacholine in 17 adults with mild or moderate bronchial asthma who were in stable clinical condition. A double-blind, randomized, crossover design was used. Eosinophil counts and eosinophilic cationic protein (ECP) levels were determined in blood and sputum samples obtained on the morning of the methacholine provocation testing day.\\n                After 8 weeks of treatment with clarithromycin, patients' symptoms, blood and sputum eosinophils counts and sputum ECP levels were significantly decreased compared with both placebo and baseline. Furthermore, values of PC20 methacholine improved in all patients after clarithromycin treatment.\\n                Clarithromycin has a bronchial anti-inflammatory effect associated with decreased eosinophilic infiltration. This study suggests interesting therapeutic possibilities for bronchial asthma that warrant further trials.\"\n 'A group of 75 subjects with asthma requiring daily corticosteroids for control were enrolled in a 2-yr, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of the use of troleandomycin combined with methylprednisolone, compared with methylprednisolone alone, for the management of their asthma. The primary outcome variables were determination of the lowest stable methylprednisolone dose and assessment of corticosteroid side effects. Methylprednisolone dose was adjusted to maintain optimal control of asthma symptoms. A total of 30 patients receiving TAO and 27 patients receiving placebo completed 1 yr; 17 on TAO and 8 on placebo completed 2 yr of double-blind participation. Control of asthma was equivalent in both groups. The vast majority of patients in both groups achieved alternate-day dosing (29 of 30 on TAO and 23 of 27 on placebo in the first year). The lowest stable doses of methylprednisolone achieved were 10.4 mg/day (placebo) versus 6.3 mg/day (TAO) in the 1-yr group (p = 0.03). However, the baseline dose was also significantly higher in the placebo group (22.8 versus 17.6 mg/day in the TAO group). Therefore, the reductions in methylprednisolone dose were not significantly different between treatment groups. Differences were observed between the two treatment groups in serum IgG, fasting blood sugar, serum cholesterol, and progression of osteoporosis. In each instance the more unfavorable response occurred in those subjects receiving TAO. We conclude that the addition of TAO to methylprednisolone was not accompanied by a reduction in corticosteroid side effects compared with treatment with methylprednisolone alone. Furthermore, no evidence was found for a subset of \"TAO responders.\"(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)'\n \"Fourteen-membered macrolides, such as roxithromycin, have been reported to exhibit other pharmacological activity including anti-asthmatic effects, besides antibiotic activity.\\n                This study was designed to investigate the protective effect of roxithromycin on airway responsiveness to the sulpyrine provocation test and to investigate whether this protective activity is associated with a reduction in aspirin-induced excretion of urinary leucotriene E4 (u-LTE4), a marker of cysteinyl leucotriene overproduction that participates in the pathogenesis of aspirin-intolerant asthma. Also, the present study was designed to examine whether or not its anti-asthmatic activity was associated with a reduction in eosinophilic inflammation.\\n                For 8 weeks before analysis, subjects received 150 mg of roxithromycin or matching placebo twice daily. We assessed the effects of pretreatment with roxithromycin on bronchoconstriction precipitated by inhalation of sulpyrine in 14 adult patients with mild or moderate aspirin-intolerant asthma; those who were in stable clinical condition and were hyperresponsive to sulpyrine provocation test were allocated to this study. A double-blind, randomized, crossover design was used. Urinary LTE4 was measured by a combined reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (rp-HPLC) enzyme immunoassay on sulpyrine provocation testing day. Blood and sputum samples were taken in the morning on the sulpyrine provocation testing day. Eosinophil counting and measurement of eosinophilic cationic protein (ECP) were performed.\\n                After the 8 weeks of treatment with roxithromycin, patients' symptoms, blood eosinophils, serum ECP, sputum eosinophils, and sputum ECP were significantly decreased. On the other hand, values of PC20-sulpyrine did not improve after roxithromycin at all. Furthermore, although challenge with sulpyrine caused a significant increase in u-LTE4, pretreatment with roxithromycin or placebo did not affect excretion of u-LTE4.\\n                Although roxithromycin does not have antileucotriene effects, it has an antibronchial inflammatory effect associated with eosinophilic infiltration. This study raises further interesting therapeutic possibilities and warrants further trials of new approaches to the treatment of aspirin-intolerant asthma.\"]",
         "Considering the small number of patients studied, there is insufficient evidence to support or to refute the use of macrolides in patients with chronic asthma. Further studies are needed in particular to clarify the potential role of macrolides in some subgroups of asthmatics such as those with evidence of chronic bacterial infection."

         "[\"This study examined the effect of a time-limited welfare program on school-age children using data on almost 3,000 children (ages 5-17 at the four year follow up-point) from the random assignment evaluation of Florida's Family Transition Program (FTP). FTP was one of the first welfare reform initiatives to impose a time limit on the receipt of cash assistance, and it combined the time limit with a rich array of mandatory services. The effects of FTP on children were moderated by families' risk of long-term welfare dependency. Contrary to predictions laid out at the outset, there were few effects of FTP on middle childhood and adolescent children for children of parents most likely to be long-term welfare dependent (those most likely to hit the time limit). However, consistent negative effects on this same age group of children were found for children of parents least likely to be long-term welfare dependent--parents who had the largest employment gains--and effects of FTP were most strongly negative for the oldest adolescent children. The findings suggest a different theoretical model for movements into employment than the one suggested in the previous literature for job loss. The findings are discussed in terms of their contribution to research and policy.\"\n 'This study compared the behavioral and school problems of young children whose mothers participated in two different income support programs, Jobs First and AFDC. The analyses also included measures of maternal education, maternal health, maternal psychological factors, and family environment. There were no differences in child school or behavioral problems across the income support programs. Children, however, were more likely to have school problems if they were older or if their mothers received less than a high school education, reported child behavioral problems or made criteria for depression on the CIDI. Behavioral problems were more likely to occur if mothers reported violence in the home, many depressive symptoms on the CES-D, few child positive qualities, or if the child had repeated a grade. Several familial factors, then, must be addressed in order to ensure that children excel both academically and behaviorally.'\n 'To test the hypotheses that (1) a monetary incentive promotes peer-support group participation; and (2) peer-support group participation decreases repeat adolescent pregnancies.\\n                Two-year, prospective, randomized controlled trial.\\n                Denver, Colo.\\n                A total of 286 primiparous girls younger than 18 years, whose infants were younger than 5 months.\\n                Participants were randomized to 4 interventions: monetary incentive and peer-support group, peer-support group only, monetary incentive only, or no intervention.\\n                Consistency of participation in planned intervention and repeat pregnancy.\\n                Participation in interventions was generally low. Hypothesis 1 was supported: 58% of those offered a monetary incentive participated in the peer-support groups, compared with 9% of those who were not offered the incentive. Hypothesis 2 was rejected: the peer-support group experience failed to prevent repeat pregnancies. The incidence of second pregnancies at 6 months (9%, 22/248), at 12 months (20%, 49/248), at 18 months (29%, 72/248), and at 24 months (39%, 97/248) following delivery did not vary significantly in relation to intervention strategy. Background sociodemographic characteristics significantly affected the timing of subsequent conceptions but not intervention participation.\\n                A monetary incentive draws adolescent mothers to sites where they can discuss the costs and benefits of contraception and conception with knowledgeable adults and supportive peers. These discussions do not prevent repeat pregnancies. Further studies are needed to determine if an intervention that produces substantive changes in the daily living environment will eliminate the sexual practices that are responsible for the high rate of repeat pregnancy in this population.']",
         "The review set out to examine the potential of financial support to poor families to improve circumstances for children. However, on the basis of current evidence we cannot state unequivocally whether financial benefits delivered as an intervention are effective at improving child health or well-being in the short term. Our conclusions are limited by the fact that most of the studies had small effects on total household income and that, while no conditions were attached to how money was spent, all studies included strict conditions for receipt of payments. We note particular concerns by some authors that sanctions and conditions (such as working hours) placed on families may increase family stress."

Analyses were by intention to treat.\\n                Cilomilast 15 mg twice daily significantly improved FEV(1) compared with placebo (mean 130 mL vs -30 mL [95% CI 90-240] at week 6, p<0.0001). FVC and peak expiratory flow were also improved (p=0.001 and p<0.0001, respectively). Quality of life measures did not differ significantly between the groups. There were no significant differences in serious adverse events between the groups.\\n                Cilomilast 15 mg twice daily might be an effective maintenance treatment for COPD. Further clinical studies are underway.'\n 'Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is characterised by progressive airflow limitation associated with chronic inflammation. There are few treatment options for the disease. This study assessed the efficacy and safety of roflumilast, a phosphodiesterase-4 inhibitor, in patients with moderate to severe COPD.\\n                This phase III, multicentre, double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled study was undertaken in an outpatient setting. 1411 patients with COPD were randomly assigned roflumilast 250 microg (n=576), roflumilast 500 microg (n=555), or placebo (n=280) given orally once daily for 24 weeks. Primary outcomes were postbronchodilator FEV1 and health-related quality of life. Secondary outcomes included other lung function parameters and COPD exacerbations. Analyses were by intention to treat.\\n                1157 (82%) patients completed the study; 32 (11%) withdrew from the placebo group, 100 (17%) from the roflumilast 250 microg group, and 124 (22%) from the roflumilast 500 microg group. Postbronchodilator FEV1 at the end of treatment significantly improved with roflumilast 250 microg (by 74 mL [SD 18]) and roflumilast 500 microg (by 97 mL [18]) compared with placebo (p<0.0001). Improvement in health-related quality of life was greater with roflumilast 250 microg (-3.4 units [0.6]) and roflumilast 500 microg (-3.5 units [0.6]) than with placebo (-1.8 units [0.8]), although the differences between treatment groups were not significant. The mean numbers of exacerbations per patient were 1.13 (2.37), 1.03 (2.33), and 0.75 (1.89) with placebo, roflumilast 250 microg, and roflumilast 500 microg, respectively. Most adverse events were mild to moderate in intensity and resolved during the study.\\n                Roflumilast is a promising candidate for anti-inflammatory COPD treatment because it improved lung function and reduced exacerbations compared with placebo. Long-term studies are needed to fully assess the effect on health-related quality of life.']",
         "In people with COPD, PDE4 inhibitors offered benefit over placebo in improving lung function and reducing likelihood of exacerbations, however, they had little impact on quality of life or symptoms. Gastrointestinal adverse effects and weight loss were common. The optimum place of PDE4 inhibitors in COPD management remains to be defined. Longer-term trials are needed to determine whether or not PDE4 inhibitors modify FEV1 decline, healthcare utilisation or mortality in COPD."

         "['The Memorial Sloan-Kettering lung cancer screening program was begun in 1974 to evaluate sputum cytology as a supplement to the annual chest x-ray examination for early detection and diagnosis. The 10,040 adult, male cigarette smokers who enrolled were randomly assigned to receive annual chest x-ray examinations only or a dual screen with annual chest x-ray examination and four monthly sputum cytology evaluation. Over 40 percent of the 288 who developed lung cancer were diagnosed in stage I, and their survival was 76 percent at five years; overall survival was 35 percent. Nearly one third of the lung cancers detected on first examination on the dual screen, and 14 percent of those on subsequent examinations were found by cytologic examination. The same number of cancers developed in the x-ray screen only group, and were diagnosed at a later date. Despite the delay, survival and mortality were the same, suggesting that the squamous carcinomas detected by cytologic examination alone are very slow growing and tend to remain localized until detectable by x-ray examination.'\n 'The aggressive and heterogeneous nature of lung cancer has thwarted efforts to reduce mortality from this cancer through the use of screening. The advent of low-dose helical computed tomography (CT) altered the landscape of lung-cancer screening, with studies indicating that low-dose CT detects many tumors at early stages. The National Lung Screening Trial (NLST) was conducted to determine whether screening with low-dose CT could reduce mortality from lung cancer.\\n                From August 2002 through April 2004, we enrolled 53,454 persons at high risk for lung cancer at 33 U.S. medical centers. Participants were randomly assigned to undergo three annual screenings with either low-dose CT (26,722 participants) or single-view posteroanterior chest radiography (26,732). Data were collected on cases of lung cancer and deaths from lung cancer that occurred through December 31, 2009.\\n                The rate of adherence to screening was more than 90%. The rate of positive screening tests was 24.2% with low-dose CT and 6.9% with radiography over all three rounds. A total of 96.4% of the positive screening results in the low-dose CT group and 94.5% in the radiography group were false positive results. The incidence of lung cancer was 645 cases per 100,000 person-years (1060 cancers) in the low-dose CT group, as compared with 572 cases per 100,000 person-years (941 cancers) in the radiography group (rate ratio, 1.13; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.03 to 1.23). There were 247 deaths from lung cancer per 100,000 person-years in the low-dose CT group and 309 deaths per 100,000 person-years in the radiography group, representing a relative reduction in mortality from lung cancer with low-dose CT screening of 20.0% (95% CI, 6.8 to 26.7; P=0.004). The rate of death from any cause was reduced in the low-dose CT group, as compared with the radiography group, by 6.7% (95% CI, 1.2 to 13.6; P=0.02).\\n                Screening with the use of low-dose CT reduces mortality from lung cancer. (Funded by the National Cancer Institute; National Lung Screening Trial ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT00047385.).'\n 'In a controlled investigation the survival prospects of lung cancer in a population of men aged 40 and over who had been offered six-monthly chest radiographs over a period of three years were compared with lung cancer in a similar population without such x-ray facilities. The five-year survival rate of lung cancer in the study series was 15%, and in cases discovered by six-monthly examination 23%, compared with 6% in the control series. The average expectation of life after diagnosis was 2.5 years for the test cases and 1.2 for the control cases. Survival declined with age. Of resected lung cancer, 32% survived five years in the test series and 23% in the control series. The five-year survival rate for squamous carcinoma and adenocarcinoma in the test series was 28% and 25% respectively, compared with 15% and nil in the control series.On the basis of these results it is concluded that through earlier radiological detection a modest improvement in the prognosis of lung cancer can be achieved.'\n 'The National Cancer Institute of the United States recently sponsored three large-scale, randomized controlled trials of screening for early lung cancer. The trials were conducted at the Johns Hopkins Medical Institutions, the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, and the Mayo Clinic. Participants were middle-aged and older men who were chronic heavy cigarette smokers and thus at high risk of developing lung cancer. Screening procedures were chest radiography and sputum cytology, the only screening tests of established value for detecting early stage, asymptomatic lung cancer. In the Hopkins and Memorial trials the study population was offered yearly chest radiography plus sputum cytology every 4 months. The control population was offered yearly chest radiography only. In these trials the addition of sputum cytology appeared to confer no lung cancer mortality rate advantage. The Mayo Clinic trial compared offering chest radiography and sputum cytology every 4 months to offering advice that the two tests be obtained once a year. This trial demonstrated significantly increased lung cancer detection, resectability, and survivorship in the group offered screening every 4 months compared with the control group. However, there was no significant difference in lung cancer mortality rate between the two groups. The statistical power of these trials was somewhat limited. Nevertheless, results do not justify recommending large-scale radiologic or cytologic screening for early lung cancer at this time.'\n 'The Multiphasic Health Checkup Evaluation Study, a long-term clinical trial, has been completed. A study group of 5156 men and women age 35-54 at entry was urged to have annual multiphasic health checkups (MHCs) for 16 years. A control group of 5557 comparable subjects was not so urged but was followed up in a comparable fashion. The mean and median number of MHCs per person were 6.8 and 6, respectively, in the study group and 2.8 and 1, respectively, in the control group. During 16 years the study group experienced a 30% reduction (p less than 0.05) in deaths from pre-specified \"potentially postponable\" causes, largely associated with lower death rates from colorectal cancer and hypertension. This reduction was most pronounced in the early years of the study. The two groups did not differ to a statistically significant degree in mortality from all other causes (84% of total mortality) or in total mortality. There was no difference in self-reported disability in the overall groups. In the setting of our prepaid health care plan where MHCs were already available on a voluntary basis, a program of urging middle-aged persons to undergo regular MHCs brought about a substantial reduction in mortality from preselected diseases.'\n 'A prospective and controlled study for early detection of lung cancer in the county of Erfurt with a follow-up of 10 years is presented. A collective of 41,532 males born between 1907 and 1932 was screened by chest fluorography at 6 month intervals and compared with a control group consisting of 102,348 males of the same age, who were screened at intervals of about 18 months. No significant reduction of overall mortality and of lung cancer mortality was achieved. Semi-annual screening brought about a higher detection rate (9%/6.5%), an increase in the resection rate (28%/19%) and higher 5 and 10 year survival rates (52%; 27%/39%; 19%) of resected patients than screening in 18 month intervals. Among those patients who refused resection or were surgically untreatable, the difference in survival rates between the two investigation groups lasted only up to the 12 months barrier. This is regarded as the effect of the lead-time bias. Fluorographic screening is effective only in patients with peripheral cancers. Patients resected for central lung cancers did not show differences in the survival rates. In both investigation groups considered together surgical therapy was possible mainly in those patients who had been detected by screening (resection rate: 48%; 5 yr survival rate: 26.9%). The resection rate of all the others amounted to 9%, the 5 yr survival rate to 1.4%. Therefore we consider fluorography to time as the only chance for lung cancer control of high risk groups in spite of the absence of reduction of lung cancer mortality.']",
         "The current evidence does not support screening for lung cancer with chest radiography or sputum cytology. Annual low-dose CT screening is associated with a reduction in lung cancer mortality in high-risk smokers but further data are required on the cost effectiveness of screening and the relative harms and benefits of screening across a range of different risk groups and settings."

         "['A randomized, prospective study should be done to evaluate any new procedure or instrument. Our experience with the end-to-end anastomosis (EEA) stapler suggests that an anastomosis can be created in a shorter time than is required for the traditional hand-sewn technique. This difference is even greater when the anastomosis is technically difficult and located deep within the pelvis. There appears to be little difference in the security of a hand-sewn anastomosis compared with that of stapled anastomosis. Postoperative complications appear similar. With the stapler, however, there is an increased risk of intraoperative complications that are not apparent with the traditional hand-sewn technique. These include rectal tears and anastomotic defects. It appears that the EEA stapler can save as many as 12 percent of rectums that otherwise might have to be removed because of technical inability to perform an anastomosis.'\n 'One hundred and eighteen patients undergoing low colorectal anastomoses were randomly allocated to reconstitution by either single layer interrupted extramucosal sutures or circular staple gun. In the 60 patients undergoing sutured anastomosis there were 2 (3 per cent) clinical leaks and 4 (7 per cent) radiological leaks, and no failures. Of the 58 patients who underwent stapled anastomosis there were 4 failures, 7 (12 per cent) clinical leaks, 14 (24 per cent) radiological leaks and 1 death. Stapled anastomoses were more than ten times as expensive as sutured anastomoses and there were no savings in time or numbers of associated colostomies. An interrupted extramucosal suture technique remains the ultimate standard for low colorectal anastomosis.'\n 'Stapler and manual sutures in rectal end-to-end anastomoses were compared in a controlled trial. The following results were obtained: For the analysis the cases naturally separated into three groups, A (manual suture), B (planned stapler suture) and WD (\"withdrawn\" cases, from both groups, in which continence could be maintained only with a stapler suture). The distribution of the WD cases in dependence on localization and sex varied significantly from groups A and B, while A and B remained comparable, in spite of the WD cases. The analysis of the date showed no, or only slight, clinical differences. In a comparison of the two stapler groups B and WD, significantly more suture dehiscences, colocutaneous fistulae and post-operative disturbances in bladder function were found in group WD. As a general conclusion we can state that: In comparable anastomosis localizations it is possible to achieve almost the same clinical results with both suture techniques. With a circular stapler it is, however, technically possible to perform rectum resections in cases in which this was not previously possible, particularly in men with a narrow pelvis and a stale pelvic floor. To what extent this still is an advantage after the local recurrences are taken into consideration remains to be seen.'\n 'Among the numerous anastomotic techniques after colonic resection, the mechanical sutures using staplers have been credited with a lower incidence of anastomotic leakage than hand-sewn anastomoses. This hypothesis has been tested in two multicentre, prospective, randomized trials after right hemicolectomy for carcinoma and after left colectomy with colorectal anastomosis. After right hemicolectomy, the stapled anastomosis using the GIA and TA staplers appeared to be superior to all hand-sewn anastomoses. This superiority was not apparent after left colectomy followed by colorectal anastomosis. Although the leakage rate of stapled anastomoses was similar to hand-sewn anastomoses, they carry a high rate of intra-operative mishaps. Furthermore, the stapler does not permit a lower anastomosis in this study. Finally, the overall cost of a stapled anastomosis is superior to the cost of an hand-sewn anastomosis.']",
         "The evidence found was insufficient to demonstrate any superiority of stapled over handsewn techniques in colorectal anastomosis surgery, regardless of the level of anastomosis. There were no randomised clinical trials comparing these two types of anastomosis in elective conditions in the last decade. The relevance of this research question has possibly lost its strength where elective surgery is concerned. However, in risk situations, such as emergency surgery, trauma and inflammatory bowel disease, new clinical trials are needed."

After screening and a 2-week washout period, 99 patients were randomized to receive either repaglinide (n = 66) or placebo (n = 33). Patients underwent 6 weeks of dose adjustment followed by 12 weeks of dose maintenance. Fasting and stimulated glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c), plasma glucose, insulin, and C-peptide were measured at predetermined intervals.

In addition to overall improvement in glycemic control noted with repaglinide in both sulfonylurea-treated patients and oral hypoglycemic agent-naive patients, repaglinide had a potent glucose-lowering effect in the postprandial period.'\n \"To evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of nateglinide and metformin alone and in combination in type 2 diabetic patients inadequately controlled by diet, focusing on changes in HbA1c, fasting plasma glucose (FPG), and mealtime glucose excursions.\\n                In this randomized double-blind study, patients with an HbA1c level between 6.8 and 11.0% during a 4-week placebo run-in received 24 weeks' treatment with 120 mg nateglinide before meals (n = 179), 500 mg metformin three times a day (n = 178), combination therapy (n = 172), or placebo (n = 172). HbA1c and FPG were evaluated regularly, and plasma glucose levels were determined after Sustacal challenge at weeks 0, 12, and 24. Hypoglycemia and other adverse events were recorded.\\n                At study end point, HbA1c was reduced from baseline with nateglinide and metformin but was increased with placebo (-0.5, -0.8, and +0.5%, respectively; P < or = 0.0001). Changes in FPG followed the same pattern (-0.7, -1.6, and +0.4 mmol/l; P < or = 0.0001). Combination therapy was additive (HbA1c -1.4% and FPG -2.4 mmol/l; P < or = 0.01 vs. monotherapy). After Sustacal challenge, there was a greater reduction in mealtime glucose with nateglinide monotherapy compared with metformin monotherapy or placebo (adjusted area under the curve [AUC]0-130 min -2.1, -1.1, and -0.6 mmol x h(-1) x l(-1); p < or = 0.0001).

All regimens were well tolerated.\\n                Nateglinide and metformin monotherapy each improved overall glycemic control but by different mechanisms. Nateglinide decreased mealtime glucose excursions, whereas metformin primarily affected FPG. In combination, nateglinide and metformin had complementary effects, improving HbA1c, FPG, and postprandial hyperglycemia.\"\n \"This prospective, 16-week, randomised, double-blind, parallel-group study assessed the differential impact of the prandial glucose regulating oral hypoglycaemic drug, repaglinide, and placebo upon perceptions of quality of life (QoL) and treatment satisfaction in pharmacotherapy-naive patients with Type 2 diabetes. In addition, the study assessed whether these outcomes were influenced by the patients' level of glycaemic control. A total of 253 patients were randomised in a 2:1 ratio of repaglinide: placebo, with doses taken flexibly with main meals (2-4 per day), whenever they were eaten. Repaglinide was initiated at 0.5 mg per meal, increased to 1 mg after 4 weeks if fasting plasma glucose exceeded 7.8 mmol/l. QoL and treatment satisfaction outcomes were compared using generic and disease-specific self-assessment measures, previously applied in diabetes: the WHO Wellbeing Questionnaire (WHO-WBQ), WHO Diabetes Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire (WHO-DTSQ) and EuroQoL EQ-5D. Over the trial period, repaglinide-treated patients reported a significant 9% improvement in (WHO-DTSQ) treatment satisfaction score (p < 0.05). No significant increase was associated with placebo. The correlation between decrease in glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) and increase in treatment satisfaction (WHO-DTSQ) was -0.22 (p < 0.01). Scores obtained with the other measures did not change significantly during the trial in either group, but the cohort exhibited only a slight reduction in wellbeing (WHO-WBQ) and health status (EQ-5D) at baseline compared with the background population. In conclusion, flexible mealtime dosing with oral medication appears to be well accepted by pharmacotherapy-naÃ¯ve patients with Type 2 diabetes. The results suggest that repaglinide provides a higher level of treatment satisfaction than placebo, and this may in part relate to improved glycaemic control.\"\n 'The prandial glucose regulator repaglinide has a rapid onset of action, a short half-life and is metabolised mainly by the liver. Here we report the findings of a 10-week, double-blind, parallel, placebo controlled, randomised trial with repaglinide in 25 diet-treated, sulphonylurea-naÃ¯ve patients with Type 2 diabetes. Repaglinide was titrated, based on capillary blood glucose, from 0.5 mg to a maximum of 4 mg, preprandially with breakfast and dinner. After 10 weeks, repaglinide was associated with a decrease in HbA(1c) of 2.3%Hb relative to the placebo group (P=0.018). This reflected a 30% decrease within the repaglinide group from a mean HbA(1c) of 7.0 to 4.9%Hb (P<0.002). Repaglinide was also associated with a decrease in fructosamine, by 0.88 mmol/l, relative to placebo (P<0.001), with a 20% decrease (from 3.80 to 3.04 mmol/l) within the repaglinide group (P<0.001). Fasting and postprandial blood glucose concentrations decreased in association with repaglinide by 3.6 and 6.4 mmol/l, respectively, relative to placebo (P<0.001 in each case). Within the repaglinide group fasting and postprandial blood glucose decreased by 3.9 and 6.2 mmol/l, respectively (P<0.001 in each case). The number of patients reporting hypoglycaemia in the repaglinide group was similar to placebo (15 vs. 20, respectively; NS). Test meal assessments confirmed that repaglinide effectively controls glucose levels by stimulating mealtime insulin secretion. Fasting serum insulin concentration was not raised compared to baseline or placebo during repaglinide therapy, albeit that fasting glucose levels were decreased by repaglinide. Twice-daily meal-related insulin secretagogue therapy with repaglinide, a new short and rapid-acting prandial glucose regulator, is capable of improving all measures of glycaemic control without increased hypoglycaemia or fasting hyperinsulinaemia.'\n 'The objective of the study was to assess the efficacy and safety of four fixed doses of nateglinide compared with placebo in the treatment of patients with type 2 diabetes with focus on the prandial state.\\n                This randomized double-blind placebo-controlled multicenter study was conducted in 289 patients who received either nateglinide at doses of 30 mg (n = 51), 60 mg (n = 58), 120 mg (n = 63), or 180 mg (n = 57) or placebo (n = 60) before three main meals for 12 weeks. Levels of HbA1c, fasting plasma glucose (FPG), fructosamine, and plasma lipids were measured at predetermined intervals, and the effects of nateglinide on prandial glucose insulin, C-peptide, and triglyceride levels were measured after a liquid standard meal (Sustacal; Mead Johnson, Evansville, IN). Adverse events and hypoglycemic episodes were recorded.\\n                After a liquid meal challenge, nateglinide rapidly increased mealtime insulin levels within 30 min of drug intake and reduced mealtime glucose excursions without affecting triglyceride levels. At study end point, reduction of HbA1c levels was statistically significantly greater with nateglinide at doses of 60, 120, and 180 mg than placebo (-0.45, -0.62, and -0.64%, respectively; P<0.05). The mean level of FPG was significantly reduced versus placebo in the nateglinide 120-mg group only (-1.14 mmol/l P<0.01). Overall, nateglinide was well tolerated.\\n                This study demonstrated that nateglinide improves mealtime and mean glycemic control in a dose-dependent manner by restoring early insulin secretion phase. Nateglinide was well tolerated and is suitable for the treatment of patients with type 2 diabetes.'\n 'A randomized, parallel-group, open-label, multicenter 16-week clinical trial compared efficacy and safety of repaglinide monotherapy and nateglinide monotherapy in type 2 diabetic patients previously treated with diet and exercise.\\n                Enrolled patients (n = 150) had received treatment with diet and exercise in the previous 3 months with HbA(1c) >7 and < or =12%.

Primary and secondary efficacy end points were changes in HbA(1c) and fasting plasma glucose (FPG) values from baseline, respectively. Postprandial glucose, insulin, and glucagon were assessed after a liquid test meal (baseline, week 16). Safety was assessed by incidence of adverse events or hypoglycemia.\\n                Mean baseline HbA(1c) values were similar in both groups (8.9%). Final HbA(1c) values were lower for repaglinide monotherapy than nateglinide monotherapy (7.3 vs. 7.9%). Mean final reductions of HbA(1c) were significantly greater for repaglinide monotherapy than nateglinide monotherapy (-1.57 vs. -1.04%; P = 0.002). Mean changes in FPG also demonstrated significantly greater efficacy for repaglinide than nateglinide (-57 vs. -18 mg/dl; P < 0.001). HbA(1c) values <7% were achieved by 54% of repaglinide-treated patients versus 42% for nateglinide. Median final doses were 6.0 mg/day for repaglinide and 360 mg/day for nateglinide. There were 7% of subjects treated with repaglinide (five subjects with one episode each) who had minor hypoglycemic episodes (blood glucose <50 mg/dl) versus 0 patients for nateglinide. Mean weight gain at the end of the study was 1.8 kg in the repaglinide group as compared with 0.7 kg for the nateglinide group.\\n                In patients previously treated with diet and exercise, repaglinide and nateglinide had similar postprandial glycemic effects, but repaglinide monotherapy was significantly more effective than nateglinide monotherapy in reducing HbA(1c) and FPG values after 16 weeks of therapy.'\n 'To evaluate effects of the oral antidiabetic insulinotropic agent nateglinide on myocardial blood flow (MBF) and microvascular reactivity in Type 2 diabetic patients.\\n                Forty-seven Type 2 diabetic patients were randomly assigned 2 : 1 to nateglinide 120 mg (t.i.d., n = 33) or placebo (n = 14). At baseline and after 16 weeks of treatment, MBF was quantified using positron emission tomography with N-13 ammonia at rest, during endothelial-dependent stimulation by cold pressor test and during adenosine-mediated vasodilation. Additional blood samples were taken to assess glycaemic control and lipid profile.\\n                MBF at rest and during adenosine did not change during the study. The percentage of flow increase from rest during cold pressor test did not improve significantly in the nateglinide group vs. placebo (from 26.1 +/- 37.2% to 29.1 +/- 27.8% between week 0 to week 16 for nateglinide vs. 14.9 +/- 37.1% to 18.1 +/- 28.4% for placebo; P = 0.07 for nateglinide when adjusted for higher baseline values). Nateglinide decreased HbA1c by 0.4% (from 7.6 +/- 0.9% to 7.2 +/- 1.3%) compared to an increase of 0.5% in the placebo group (from 7.9 +/- 0.8% to 8.4 +/- 1.7%; P = 0.02 for nateglinide). No differences between the two groups were observed in insulin levels and lipid status.\\n                Nateglinide neither improved, nor impaired myocardial blood flow in Type 2 diabetic patients. Potential effects on endothelial-dependent myocardial blood flow remain to be investigated further. Positron emission tomography is a sensitive approach to assess the effects of therapeutic agents on myocardial blood flow in patients with diabetes.'\n \"To compare glycaemic control and cardiovascular risk profile in patients with type 2 diabetes following 12 months' treatment with either repaglinide or metformin.\\n                This was an open uncontrolled randomised study in n=112 patients with inadequately controlled type 2 diabetes not previously treated with oral hypoglycaemic agents. Patients beginning treatment with either repaglinide or metformin entered an 8-week titration period (to optimise dosage: repaglinide, 2-4 mg/day; metformin, 1500-2500 mg/day) followed by a 12-month treatment period. Glycaemic control and cardiovascular risk factors were determined at baseline and at the end of the treatment period.\\n                Mean (S.D.) final drug doses were 3 (+/-1) mg/day in the repaglinide group and 2000 (+/-500) mg/day in the metformin group. Significant improvements in glycaemic control [glycated haemoglobin, fasting and 2-h postprandial plasma glucose (PPG)] were demonstrated in both treatment groups. The decrease in PPG was significantly greater in the repaglinide group (P<0.05). During the treatment period, fasting plasma insulin (FPI) decreased significantly in both groups, more so with metformin (P<0.05). Two-hour postprandial plasma insulin (PPI) levels decreased only in the metformin group (P<0.05). Significant improvements between baseline and final visit were demonstrated in one or both groups in the following cardiovascular risk factors: total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), triglycerides, plasminogen activator inhibitor, lipoprotein(a) and homocysteine. No changes were observed in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), apolipoprotein A-I, apolipoprotein B, fibrinogen, body mass index (BMI) or blood pressure.\\n                The use of repaglinide or metformin in drug therapy-nai;ve patients with type 2 diabetes over a 12-month period is associated with improvements in both glycaemic control and cardiovascular risk profile. The latter cannot necessarily be attributed to the pharmacotherapy per se, but provides reassurance in the context of initiating oral hypoglycaemic drug therapy with these agents.\"\n 'To compare the effect of repaglinide in combination with metformin with monotherapy of each drug on glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes.\\n                A total of 83 patients with type 2 diabetes who had inadequate glycemic control (HbA1c > 7.1%) when receiving the antidiabetic agent metformin were enrolled in this multicenter, double-blind trial. Subjects were randomized to continue with their prestudy dose of metformin (n = 27), to continue with their prestudy dose of metformin with the addition of repaglinide (n = 27), or to receive repaglinide alone (n = 29). For patients receiving repaglinide, the optimal dose was determined during a 4- to 8-week titration and continued for a 3-month maintenance period.\\n                In subjects receiving combined therapy, HbA1c was reduced by 1.4 +/- 0.2%, from 8.3 to 6.9% (P = 0.0016) and fasting plasma glucose by 2.2 mmol/l (P = 0.0003). No significant changes were observed in subjects treated with either repaglinide or metformin monotherapy in HbA1c (0.4 and 0.3% decrease, respectively) or fasting plasma glucose (0.5 mmol/l increase and 0.3 mmol/l decrease respectively). Subjects receiving repaglinide either alone or in combination with metformin, had an increase in fasting levels of insulin between baseline and the end of the trial of 4.04 +/- 1.56 and 4.23 +/- 1.50 mU/l, respectively (P < 0.02). Gastrointestinal adverse events were common in the metformin group. An increase in body weight occurred in the repaglinide and combined therapy groups (2.4 +/- 0.5 and 3.0 +/- 0.5 kg, respectively; P < 0.05).\\n                Combined metformin and repaglinide therapy resulted in superior glycemic control compared with repaglinide or metformin monotherapy in patients with type 2 diabetes whose glycemia had not been well controlled on metformin alone. Repaglinide monotherapy was as effective as metformin monotherapy.'\n \"To compare the effect on glycemic control and weight gain of repaglinide versus metformin combined with bedtime NPH insulin in patients with type 2 diabetes.\\n                A total of 80 subjects treated with 850 or 1,000 mg t.i.d. metformin combined with bedtime NPH insulin were randomized to 13 weeks of open-label treatment with 4 mg t.i.d. repaglinide (n = 39) or metformin (dose unchanged) (n = 41). Insulin dose was titrated at the clinician's discretion, aiming for a fasting blood glucose (FBG) < or =6.0 mmol/l.\\n                Baseline age, diabetes duration, insulin requirement, weight, BMI, FBG, and HbA(1c) (Diabetes Control and Complications Trial-aligned assay, normal range 4.6-6.2%) were similar. Glycemic control improved (nonsignificantly) with insulin/metformin by (mean) 0.4%, from 8.4 to 8.1% (P = 0.09) but deteriorated with insulin/repaglinide by (mean) 0.4%, from 8.1 to 8.6% (P = 0.03; P = 0.005 between groups). Weight gain was less with insulin/metformin: 0.9 +/- 0.4 kg (means +/- SE) (P = 0.01) versus 2.7 +/- 0.4 kg (P < 0.0001) (P = 0.002 between groups). The Diabetes Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire score (potential range 0 [minimum] to 36 [maximum]) increased from 32.4 +/- 0.8 to 34.1 +/- 0.5 (P = 0.01) with insulin/metformin but decreased from 32.5 +/- 0.9 to 29.1 +/- 1.3 (P < 0.002) with insulin/repaglinide.\\n                Combined with bedtime NPH insulin, metformin provides superior glycemic control to repaglinide with less weight gain and improved diabetes treatment satisfaction.\"\n 'An open-label, parallel-group, randomized, multicenter trial was conducted to compare efficacy and safety of repaglinide versus nateglinide, when used in a combination regimen with metformin for treatment of type 2 diabetes.\\n                Enrolled patients (n = 192) had HbA(1c) >7% and < or =12% during previous treatment with a sulfonylurea, metformin, or low-dose Glucovance (glyburide < or =2.5 mg, metformin < or =500 mg). After a 4-week metformin run-in therapy period (doses escalated to 1,000 mg b.i.d.), patients were randomized to addition of repaglinide (n = 96) (1 mg/meal, maximum 4 mg/meal) or nateglinide (n = 96) (120 mg/meal, reduced to 60 mg if needed) to the regimen for 16 weeks. Glucose, insulin, and glucagon were assessed after a liquid test meal at baseline and week 16.\\n                Final HbA(1c) values were lower for repaglinide/metformin treatment than for nateglinide/metformin (7.1 vs. 7.5%). Repaglinide/metformin therapy showed significantly greater mean reductions of HbA(1c) (-1.28 vs. -0.67%; P < 0.001) and of fasting plasma glucose (FPG) (-39 vs. -21 mg/dl; P = 0.002). Self-monitoring of blood glucose profiles were significantly lower for repaglinide/metformin before breakfast, before lunch, and at 2:00 A.M. Changes in the area under the curve of postprandial glucose, insulin, or glucagon peaks after a test meal were not significantly different for the two treatment groups during this study. Median final doses were 5.0 mg/day for repaglinide and 360 mg/day for nateglinide. Safety assessments were comparable for the two regimens.\\n                The addition of repaglinide to metformin therapy resulted in reductions of HbA(1c) and FPG values that were significantly greater than the reductions observed for addition of nateglinide.'\n 'In this 24-week multicenter, double-blind, randomized, fixed-dose trial, 361 patients having type 2 diabetes received daily preprandial treatment with placebo (n = 75), repaglinide 1 mg (n = 140), or repaglinide 4 mg (n = 146). By a last-observation carried-forward calculation, repaglinide 1 mg or 4 mg treatment decreased mean fasting plasma glucose (FPG) values (by -47 mg/dL or -49 mg/dL) while the placebo group had increased FPG values (by 19 mg/dL). For the repaglinide treatment groups at the end of the study, changes in HbA1c from baseline values ranged from 1.8 to 1.9 percentage points lower than the placebo group. There were no events of severe hypoglycemia. Nearly all hypoglycemic symptom episodes had blood glucose levels above 45 mg/dL. Repaglinide was well tolerated in a preprandial fixed-dose regimen of 1 mg or 4 mg, assigned without adjustment for clinical parameters.'\n 'Nateglinide is a fast-acting insulin secretion agent that specifically targets postprandial hyperglycemia in patients with type 2 diabetes. The recent reduction in the diagnostic criteria for diabetes and improved understanding of the importance of early insulin secretion served as the rationale for this multicenter, double-blind, randomized, parallel-group, 24-wk study performed in 675 patients with type 2 diabetes but only moderately elevated fasting plasma glucose (FPG) (FPG = 7.0-8.3 mmol/liter) to assess the efficacy and safety of three fixed doses of nateglinide (30, 60, or 120 mg, with meals). A substudy of the effects on early insulin release and prandial glucose excursions following a standardized breakfast was performed in 127 subjects. Nateglinide was well tolerated and elicited a dose-dependent reduction of placebo-adjusted hemoglobin A(1c) (Delta = -0.26 to -0.39%) and FPG (Delta = -0.51 to -0.73 mmol/liter) accompanied by a dose-related increase in suspected hypoglycemic episodes. However, confirmed hypoglycemia occurred in only 5.3% of patients treated with the highest dose, compared with 1.2% in placebo-treated patients (P < 0.05). Nateglinide increased early insulin release and reduced prandial glucose excursions (P < 0.05 vs. placebo). In sum, nateglinide is a safe and effective therapeutic option for treatment of patients with mild to moderate fasting hyperglycemia.']",
         "Meglitinides may offer an alternative oral hypoglycaemic agent of similar potency to metformin, and may be indicated where side effects of metformin are intolerable or where metformin is contraindicated. However, there is no evidence available to indicate what effect meglitinides will have on important long-term outcomes, particularly mortality."
