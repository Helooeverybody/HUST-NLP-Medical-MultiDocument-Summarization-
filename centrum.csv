0,"Fetal lung maturation: the combined use of corticosteroids and thyrotropin-releasing hormone.<doc-sep>The purpose of this randomized study was to evaluate whether the combined use of corticosteroids and thyrotropin-releasing hormone would enhance fetal lung maturation to a greater degree than would corticosteroids alone. The study was restricted to patients under 34 weeks' gestation with a lecithin/sphingomyelin (L/S) ratio less than 2.0. The patients were randomized into a study group receiving intravenous thyrotropin-releasing hormone along with intramuscular corticosteroids over 48 hours and a control group receiving only corticosteroids. Patients undelivered 1 week after the onset of therapy underwent a repeat amniocentesis to document changes in the L/S ratio. In those patients delivering within 1 week of therapy, the neonatal clinical course was established by two investigators blinded to the antenatal therapy. Compared with the control group, the group receiving antenatal corticosteroids plus thyrotropin-releasing hormone showed a greater post-therapy increase in L/S ratio, fewer respirator days, and a lower incidence of bronchopulmonary dysplasia. The results of this study suggest that the combined use of corticosteroids and thyrotropin-releasing hormone results in enhanced fetal pulmonic maturation superior to that achieved with corticosteroids alone.<doc-sep>Combined hormonal therapy for the prevention of respiratory distress syndrome and its consequences.<doc-sep>In performing this meta-analysis, we have attempted to use comparable data, but there are limitations to the information that is available at present. Some studies reported results for all patients entered, whereas others reported only optimally treated patients (Table 2). Many of the trials have not yet been published in final form and subjected to peer review. In addition, all the studies reported here were conducted before the widespread use of surfactant therapy. It is unclear whether the benefit of antenatal TRH and steroid therapy on end points such as death or BPD would persist if surfactant was also used. (Surfactant has, however, little impact on the percentage of survivors with BPD, perhaps because sicker infants survive with this treatment and go on to develop BPD.) Studies comparing antenatal TRH plus steroid plus postnatal surfactant to antenatal steroid plus postnatal surfactant are clearly required, and are in progress in a number of centers around the world. Because of these limitations, the routine use of antenatal TRH plus steroid cannot be currently recommended. However, the apparent benefits of this therapy in terms of RDS, death, and CLD that have been reported here do suggest that it might be used in selected situations. An example is threatened delivery of a very premature infant with an immature amniotic fluid pulmonary maturation profile. These infants are at risk for RDS and CLD, even if antenatal steroid and postnatal surfactant therapy is used.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)<doc-sep>A randomized, controlled trial of antepartum thyrotropin-releasing hormone and betamethasone in the prevention of respiratory disease in preterm infants.<doc-sep>The objective was to investigate whether the addition of thyrotropin-releasing hormone to antepartum betamethasone further reduces the incidence of respiratory disease in preterm infants.
                A randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial of antepartum thyrotropin-releasing hormone (400 micrograms given intravenously four times) and betamethasone (5 mg given intramuscularly four times) was conducted in 378 mothers likely to be delivered between 24 and 32.6 weeks' gestation. Statistical analysis was by relative risk, chi 2, t tests, and multiple logistic regression analysis.
                Four hundred five live-born infants were delivered. In infants without lethal abnormalities delivered between 24 hours and 10 days from entry (n = 175) the incidence of respiratory distress syndrome was reduced from 52% to 31% (relative risk 0.61, 95% confidence interval 0.41 to 0.89) and that of severe respiratory distress syndrome from 42% to 20% (relative risk 0.48, 95% confidence interval 0.29 to 0.78) in the placebo and thyrotropin-releasing hormone groups, respectively. The number of deaths fell from 14 to one (relative risk 0.08, 95% confidence interval 0.01 to 0.63). The incidence of chronic lung disease was not significantly different, but that of an adverse outcome (chronic lung disease or death by 36 weeks' gestation) fell from 29% in the placebo group to 16% with thyrotropin-releasing hormone (relative risk 0.55, 95% confidence interval 0.31 to 0.99).
                The addition of thyrotropin-releasing hormone to antepartum glucocorticoid treatment reduces the incidence of respiratory distress syndrome and improves survival in preterm infants.<doc-sep>Collaborative trial of prenatal thyrotropin-releasing hormone and corticosteroids for prevention of respiratory distress syndrome. Collaborative Santiago Surfactant Group.<doc-sep>Our purpose was to determine whether adding antenatal thyrotropin-releasing hormone to prenatal corticosteroids reduces the frequency of respiratory distress syndrome.
                A randomized, multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was conducted of thyrotropin-releasing hormone (400 micrograms intravenously every 8 hours four times) in women with singleton pregnancies < 33 weeks of gestation who received antenatal betamethasone (12 mg intramuscularly every 24 hours two times). Neonates weighing < 1.0 kg received prophylactic surfactant and those above that weight received rescue therapy.
                One hundred ninety women received thyrotropin-releasing hormone and 180 were given placebo. There were no differences in the frequency of respiratory distress syndrome (relative risk 1.17 [95% confidence interval 0.93 to 1.48]), use of oxygen at age 28 days (1.14 [0.80 to 1.62]), or neonatal mortality (1.05 [0.79 to 1.38]). Air leaks were more frequent in the thyrotropin-releasing hormone group (1.57 [1.23 to 2.01]).
                The combination of antenatal thyrotropin-releasing hormone and corticosteroids does not reduce the frequency of respiratory distress syndrome or improve the outcome of preterm neonates compared with the use of corticosteroids alone.<doc-sep>Two trials of antenatal thyrotrophin-releasing hormone for fetal maturation: stopping before the due date.

                Two concurrent multicentre, double blind, randomised, placebo-controlled trials were designed with a common core dataset to be analysed as a single large pragmatic trial.
                Hospital maternity units.
                Pregnant women at risk of preterm delivery who had been prescribed a course of corticosteroids to enhance fetal maturation.
                Antenatal administration of TRH 400 microg every eight hours for four doses versus matching placebo.
                Primary: death of the baby or chronic lung disease (defined as oxygen dependency at 28 days after birth). Secondary: other measures of respiratory morbidity, in particular respiratory distress syndrome. Other measures of short term neonatal morbidity including intraventricular haemorrhage and necrotising enterocolitis. Measures of maternal side effects.
                The antenatal TRH trial was halted early on the basis of external evidence. Overall a total of 225 women were recruited who delivered 275 babies. The primary outcome of death or chronic lung disease occurred in 33 babies in the TRH group and 43 babies in the placebo group (RR 0.8, 95% CI 0.5-1.2). There were no other differences between the two groups. Stratified analysis did not reveal any differences between the two groups depending on how long before the time of delivery the mother had received the TRH or placebo.
                These trials are too small to provide convincing evidence of the effect of antenatal TRH on neonatal outcome. When added to the existing systematic review and meta-analysis, however, these data should provide evidence on which subsequent practice can be based. The process by which the trials were monitored and stopped is of relevance to future trials.<doc-sep>Respiratory disease in very-low-birthweight infants after prenatal thyrotropin-releasing hormone and glucocorticoid. TRH Study Group.<doc-sep>Although prenatal glucocorticoid treatment reduces neonatal respiratory morbidity, respiratory distress syndrome and chronic lung disease (CLD) develop in many very-low-birthweight infants despite therapy. To investigate the effect of additional prenatal treatment with thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH), we did a multicentre, blinded, randomised trial. 404 women with threatened preterm delivery at less than 32 weeks' gestation received betamethasone plus TRH (4 doses of 400 micrograms 8-hourly) or betamethasone plus placebo. 103 infants who were fully treated and of less than 1500 g birthweight were evaluated during the neonatal period. TRH treatment (55 infants) did not affect the total incidence of respiratory distress syndrome (47% vs 58% in controls) or of severe respiratory distress syndrome (13% vs 25% in controls, p = 0.11). CLD (defined as requirement for supplemental oxygen at 28 days after birth) developed in significantly fewer TRH-treated infants (18% vs 44% of controls, p less than 0.01). The unadjusted relative risk of CLD with TRH therapy was 0.40 (95% CI 0.26-0.80, p less than 0.05), and this was not materially changed after adjustment for potentially modifying variables. There were significantly fewer adverse outcomes, defined as death or continuing oxygen requirement, in the TRH group than in the steroid-alone group both at 28 days and when infants reached 36 weeks' postconceptional age. The incidence of other complications of prematurity was similar in the two groups. Prenatal TRH reduces the incidence of chronic lung disease among betamethasone-treated infants.<doc-sep>Antenatal thyrotropin-releasing hormone to prevent lung disease in preterm infants. North American Thyrotropin-Releasing Hormone Study Group.<doc-sep>Pulmonary disease is common in preterm infants, despite antenatal glucocorticoid therapy. The addition of antenatal thyrotropin-releasing hormone therapy has been reported to decrease pulmonary morbidity in these infants.
                We enrolled 996 women at 13 North American centers who were in preterm labor at <30 weeks' gestation in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized trial of antenatal thyrotropin-releasing hormone, given intravenously in four doses of 400 microg each at eight-hour intervals. The primary outcome was chronic lung disease or death of the infant on or before the 28th day after delivery, and secondary outcomes were respiratory distress syndrome and chronic lung disease or death at 36 weeks' postmenstrual age. Complete data were available for 981 women and their 1134 live-born infants. The 769 infants born at < or = 32 weeks' gestation were defined as the group at risk.
                There were no significant differences between the at-risk treatment and placebo groups in mean (+/-SD) birth weight (1109+/-354 vs. 1097+/-355 g), gestational age (27.9+/-2.1 vs. 27.9+/-2.1 weeks), sex, or race. The frequencies of respiratory distress syndrome (66 percent vs. 65 percent), death at 28 days (11 percent vs. 11 percent), chronic lung disease or death at 28 days (45 percent vs. 42 percent) and at 36 weeks (32 percent vs. 34 percent), and other neonatal complications as well as the severity of lung disease were not significantly different in the at-risk treatment and placebo groups. Similarly, there were no differences in outcome between the treatment and placebo groups for the infants born at >32 weeks' gestation.
                In preterm infants at risk for lung disease, antenatal administration of thyrotropin-releasing hormone and glucocorticoid is no more beneficial than glucocorticoid alone.<doc-sep>","Prenatal TRH, in addition to corticosteroids, given to women at risk of very preterm birth do not improve infant outcomes and can cause maternal side-effects.",There is insufficient evidence to support the routine use of antenatal corticosteroids in the prevention of respiratory distress syndrome and chronic lung disease in preterm infants.,CD000019
1,"[Ante-partum administration of preventive treatment of Rh-D immunization in rhesus-negative women. Parallel evaluation of transplacental passage of fetal blood cells. Results of a multicenter study carried out in the Paris region].<doc-sep>1,969 non immunized rhesus negative primiparous women were followed up in 23 maternity units in the geographical region of Paris. 1,882 could be retained to study antepartum protection and 1,884 to study transplacental passage of fetal blood cells. Two groups were defined according to whether they were born in even or uneven years, so that: 955 were the ""control"" group who delivered 590 rhesus D positive infants, and 927 were the ""treated"" group who delivered 599 rhesus D positive infants. The ""control"" group were used as controls at the 28th and 34th weeks of pregnancy, while the ""treated"" group received two injections of anti-D immunoglobulin given on the same dates after taking the necessary tests. Immunological testing at the time of the delivery and after the delivery showed that 7 women had become Rh D immunized in the ""control"" group whereas only one in the ""treated"" group. This difference, which is statistically significant, confirms the results of other authors about the efficiency of antepartum rhesus disease prevention. The incidence of immunisation during or immediately after the first pregnancy in women who had no previous story of blood transfusions or of terminations of pregnancy is 1.11%, which is a figure relatively low as compared with studies of series carried out in North America, but close to those carried out in other European centres. When primipara of all categories are lumped together the frequency rises to 1.5%. A study of the passage of fetal red blood cells into the maternal circulation shows that at the 29th week of pregnancy out of 1,884 cases there were 5.5% positive kleihauer tests, without a large volume of blood being detected and at the 34th week of pregnancy when 957 tests were carried out, 7% were positive with one of them being of a massive transfusion of blood from the fetus to the mother, which was life-threatening for the fetus. It may be that the incidence had been under-estimated and that the positive results in the two groups, control and treated, show that there is a statistically significant difference that demonstrates that antepartum treatment in the trial has eliminated a worthwhile percentage of positive kleihauer tests which arose from the transfusion of small quantities of blood.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)<doc-sep>Multicentre trial of antepartum low-dose anti-D immunoglobulin.<doc-sep>Routine antenatal Rh immunoprophylaxis would substantially increase the use of anti-D Ig in the U.K. As availability of anti-D Ig is one factor influencing a decision to introduce routine antenatal prophylaxis, a trial was undertaken to test the efficacy of a lower dose of anti-D Ig than that used in earlier studies. RhD-negative primigravidae were randomized as controls or recipients of two doses of 250iu of anti-D Ig given at 28 and 34 weeks gestation. Blood samples were tested at delivery and at 6 months postpartum for the presence of immune anti-D, and again later if results were equivocal. Nine (1.5%) out of 595 control patients had immune anti-D at follow-up at 6 months and later; 4 (0.78%) of 513 treated women were immunized. It was concluded that, while two doses of 250iu of anti-D Ig may reduce alloimmunization, they are not as effective as two doses of 500iu in a previous trial.<doc-sep>","The risk of Rhesus D alloimmunisation during or immediately after a first pregnancy is about 1%. Administration of 100 µg (500 IU) anti-D to women in their first pregnancy can reduce this risk to about 0.2% without, to date, any adverse effects. Although unlikely to confer benefit in the current pregnancy, fewer women may have Rhesus D antibodies in any subsequent pregnancy, but the effects of this needs to be tested in studies of robust design.",There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the routine use of anti-D Ig in women with rhesus D positive pregnancies.,CD000020
2,"[Anticonvulsant treatment in severe preeclampsia. Comparison between diazepam and magnesium sulfate].<doc-sep>The objective was to compare the materno-fetal effects between Diazepam and Magnesium sulfate used as anticonvulsivant therapy in cases of severe pre-eclampsia. The study was prospective, comparative, longitudinal, randomized clinical trial. The study was done at Centro Medico Nacional Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social. Division of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Torreon, Coah, Mexico. The patients were all the women admitted to the labor and delivery ward with diagnosis of severe pre-eclampsia and viable conceptus were assigned at random to receive either Diazepam (Group A, n = 19) or Magnesium sulfate (group B, n = 19). There were no significant differences between both groups. All of the patients remained alert, conscious and well oriented. None of the newborns showed hiporreflexia, flaccidity or neonatal respiratory distress that could be implicated to the anticonvulsivant therapy. It is concluded that Diazepam and Magnesium sulfate are good alternatives as anticonvulsivant therapy in cases of severe pre-eclampsia.<doc-sep>A comparison of magnesium sulfate with phenytoin for the prevention of eclampsia.<doc-sep>Magnesium sulfate is used widely to prevent eclamptic seizures in pregnant women with hypertension, but few studies have compared the efficacy of magnesium sulfate with that of other drugs. Anticonvulsant prophylaxis with phenytoin for eclampsia has been recommended, but there are virtually no data to support its efficacy. Our objective was to compare magnesium sulfate with phenytoin in preventing seizures in hypertensive women during labor.
                We randomly assigned women with hypertension who were admitted for delivery to receive either magnesium sulfate or phenytoin. The magnesium sulfate regimen consisted of a 10-g intramuscular loading dose followed by a maintenance dose of 5 g given intramuscularly every four hours. For women with severe preeclampsia, an additional 4-g loading dose was given intravenously. The phenytoin regimen included a 1000-mg loading dose infused over a period of 1 hour, followed by a 500-mg oral dose 10 hours later. With either regimen, anticonvulsant therapy was continued for 24 hours post partum.
                Ten of 1089 women randomly assigned to the phenytoin regimen had eclamptic convulsions, as compared with none of 1049 women randomly assigned to magnesium sulfate (P = 0.004). There were no significant differences in any risk factors for eclampsia between the two study groups. Maternal and infant outcomes were also similar in the two study groups.
                Magnesium sulfate is superior to phenytoin for the prevention of eclampsia in hypertensive pregnant women. These results validate the long-practiced use of magnesium sulfate in the prevention of eclampsia.<doc-sep>Comparison of magnesium and methyldopa for the control of blood pressure in pregnancies complicated with hypertension.<doc-sep>Although magnesium is now the drug of choice for the prevention of eclamptic seizures only few studies have evaluated whether magnesium may reduce blood pressure in pregnancies complicated with hypertension.
                A total of 33 patients with pregnancy-induced hypertension were randomized to either magnesium or methyldopa treatment. Of these 16 received magnesium and 17 methyldopa. The treatment comprised a 48-hour magnesium infusion followed by oral magnesium tablets until 3 days after delivery or 250 mg methyldopa 4 times a day in a similar period.
                Patients treated with magnesium had 1 day after inclusion a statistically significantly lower systolic blood pressure compared to the level in the methyldopa group (138.1 +/- 11 vs. 147.6 +/- 11 mm Hg; p < 0.05), but no difference was observed in diastolic blood pressure (92.0 +/- 6.6 vs. 96.0 +/- 10.1 mm Hg; NS). From the 5th day of inclusion and until delivery both systolic and diastolic blood pressure were significantly lower in the magnesium group (p < 0.05). Including all blood pressure measurements in a single analysis showed that both systolic (138 +/- 13 vs. 148 +/- 15 mm Hg; p < 0.0001) and diastolic (92 +/- 10 vs. 94 +/- 10 mm Hg; p < 0.05) blood pressure were lower in the magnesium group compared to the methyldopa group. There was no difference between the two groups regarding gestational age at delivery, birth weight, Apgar scores and pH in umbilical cord blood.
                This preliminary study demonstrates that magnesium treatment lowers blood pressure in pregnancies complicated with hypertension. The effect is without any adverse effect on maternal and neonatal well-being.
                Copyright 2000 S. Karger AG, Basel<doc-sep>The effect of magnesium sulfate therapy on the duration of labor in women with mild preeclampsia at term: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial.<doc-sep>The primary outcome was to determine whether magnesium sulfate therapy prolongs the duration of labor in women with mild preeclampsia. Secondary outcomes were to assess the side effects associated with magnesium sulfate therapy: hours and maximum dose of oxytocin, incidence of progression to severe preeclampsia, incidence of cesarean delivery, change in maternal hematocrit, incidence of postpartum hemorrhage, incidence of maternal infection, and Apgar scores.
                Women with a diagnosis of mild preeclampsia at term were randomized to receive standard therapy during labor and for 12 hours post partum with either magnesium sulfate (n = 67) or a matching placebo solution (n = 68).
                There was no difference between magnesium sulfate and placebo with respect to the primary outcome variables: total length of labor (median 17.8 hours vs 16.5 hours, p = 0.7) and length of the active phase of labor (median 5.4 hours vs 6.0 hours, p = 0.5). In addition, no difference was observed in the secondary outcome variables: hours of oxytocin use, change in hematocrit, frequency of maternal infection, progression to severe preeclampsia, incidence of cesarean delivery, and Apgar scores. Although not statistically significant, the incidence of postpartum hemorrhage was approximately fourfold greater in the magnesium sulfate group (relative risk 4.1, 95% confidence interval 0.5 to 35.4). There was a significant difference in the maximum dose of oxytocin used (13.9 +/- 8.6 mU/min with magnesium sulfate vs 11.0 +/- 7.6 mU/min with placebo, p = 0.036).
                The use of magnesium sulfate during labor in women with mild preeclampsia at term does not affect any component of labor but did necessitate a higher dose of oxytocin.<doc-sep>Do women with pre-eclampsia, and their babies, benefit from magnesium sulphate? The Magpie Trial: a randomised placebo-controlled trial.<doc-sep>Anticonvulsants are used for pre-eclampsia in the belief they prevent eclamptic convulsions, and so improve outcome. Evidence supported magnesium sulphate as the drug to evaluate.
                Eligible women (n=10141) had not given birth or were 24 h or less postpartum; blood pressure of 140/90 mm Hg or more, and proteinuria of 1+ (30 mg/dL) or more; and there was clinical uncertainty about magnesium sulphate. Women were randomised in 33 countries to either magnesium sulphate (n=5071) or placebo (n=5070). Primary outcomes were eclampsia and, for women randomised before delivery, death of the baby. Follow up was until discharge from hospital after delivery. Analyses were by intention to treat.
                Follow-up data were available for 10,110 (99.7%) women, 9992 (99%) of whom received the allocated treatment. 1201 of 4999 (24%) women given magnesium sulphate reported side-effects versus 228 of 4993 (5%) given placebo. Women allocated magnesium sulphate had a 58% lower risk of eclampsia (95% CI 40-71) than those allocated placebo (40, 0.8%, vs 96, 1.9%; 11 fewer women with eclampsia per 1000 women). Maternal mortality was also lower among women allocated magnesium sulphate (relative risk 0.55, 0.26-1.14). For women randomised before delivery, there was no clear difference in the risk of the baby dying (576, 12.7%, vs 558, 12.4%; relative risk 1.02, 99% CI 0.92-1.14). The only notable difference in maternal or neonatal morbidity was for placental abruption (relative risk 0.67, 99% CI 0.45-0.89).
                Magnesium sulphate halves the risk of eclampsia, and probably reduces the risk of maternal death. There do not appear to be substantive harmful effects to mother or baby in the short term.<doc-sep>Does magnesium sulfate affect the length of labor induction in women with pregnancy-associated hypertension?<doc-sep>Our purpose was to determine whether seizure prophylaxis with magnesium sulfate prolongs induction of labor in women with pregnancy-associated hypertension.
                Women with a singleton pregnancy in vertex presentation between 32 and 42 weeks' gestation who required induction of labor for either preeclampsia, preeclampsia superimposed on chronic hypertension, or transient hypertension were randomized to receive either magnesium sulfate or phenytoin (Dilantin) for seizure prophylaxis. Women with rupture of the membranes, spontaneous contractions resulting in cervical change, or an initial cervical examination showing > 2 cm dilatation and 50% effacement were excluded.
                Fifty-four women were randomized to receive either magnesium sulfate (n = 28) or phenytoin (n = 26). The two groups were similar for selected maternal antepartum, intrapartum, and postpartum characteristics that have been associated with a prolongation or failure of labor induction. The two groups were also similar for the interval from the start of induction to (1) the first examination > or = 5 cm cervical dilatation and (2) delivery and in the frequency of women requiring cesarean delivery.
                Compared with phenytoin, magnesium sulfate seizure prophylaxis in women with pregnancy-associated hypertension does not prolong the induction of labor nor does it result in an increase in cesarean deliveries.<doc-sep>Magnesium sulfate in women with mild preeclampsia: a randomized controlled trial.<doc-sep>To determine whether magnesium sulfate prevents disease progression in women with mild preeclampsia.
                A total of 222 women with mild preeclampsia were randomized to receive intravenous magnesium sulfate (n = 109) or matched placebo (n = 113). Mild preeclampsia was defined as blood pressure of at least 140/90 mm Hg taken on two occasions in the presence of new-onset proteinuria. Patients with chronic hypertension or severe preeclampsia were excluded. Patients were considered to have disease progression if they developed signs or symptoms of severe preeclampsia, eclampsia, or laboratory abnormalities of full or partial HELLP (hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, low platelets) syndrome.
                The groups were similar with respect to maternal age, ethnicity, gestational age, parity, and maternal weight at enrollment. Fourteen women (12.8%) in the magnesium group and 19 (16.8%) in the placebo group developed severe preeclampsia after randomization (relative risk = 0.8, 95% confidence interval 0.4, 1.5, P =.41). None in either group developed eclampsia or thrombocytopenia. Women assigned magnesium had similar rates of cesarean delivery (30% versus 25%), chorioamnionitis (3% versus 2.7%), endometritis (5.3% versus 4.3%), and postpartum hemorrhage (1% versus 0.9%), compared to those assigned placebo. Neonates born to women assigned magnesium had similar mean Apgar scores at 1 and 5 minutes as those born to women assigned placebo (7.7 +/- 1.5 versus 7.8 +/- 1.6 and 8.7 +/- 0.7 versus 8.8 +/- 0.6, respectively).
                Magnesium sulfate does not have a major impact on disease progression in women with mild preeclampsia. Magnesium use does not seem to increase rates of cesarean delivery, infectious morbidity, obstetric hemorrhage, or neonatal depression.<doc-sep>A randomised controlled trial of intravenous magnesium sulphate versus placebo in the management of women with severe pre-eclampsia.<doc-sep>To determine whether the administration of prophylactic intravenous magnesium sulphate reduces the occurrence of eclampsia in women with severe pre-eclampsia.

                The data of 699 women were evaluated. Fourteen were withdrawn after randomisation. The overall incidence of eclampsia was 1.8%. Of 345 women who received magnesium sulphate, one developed eclampsia (0.3%); in the placebo group, 11/340 women (3.2%) developed eclampsia (relative risk 0.09; 95% confidence interval 0.01-0.69; P = 0.003).
                The use of intravenous magnesium sulphate in the management of women with severe pre-eclampsia significantly reduced the development of eclampsia.<doc-sep>Phenytoin versus magnesium sulfate in preeclampsia: a pilot study.<doc-sep>A randomized clinical trial was designed to determine whether there are clinically demonstrable advantages of phenytoin over magnesium sulfate in preeclamptic patients because of the latter drug's uterine relaxant properties. An intravenous infusion, immediately after randomization, of either phenytoin or magnesium sulfate, with subsequent measurement of serum concentrations and maintenance of therapeutic levels was given to 103 preeclamptic and two eclamptic women. Observed were the rate of cervical dilation during active labor and change in hematocrit between predelivery and 24-hour postdelivery values and the incidence of side effects ascertained by interview. Compared with those receiving magnesium sulfate, patients receiving phenytoin had more rapid cervical dilation (3.3 cm/hr versus 1.5 cm/hr, p = 0.016) and a smaller fall in hematocrit after delivery (-4.7% versus -7.6%, p = 0.034). A significantly lower incidence of hot flushes (15% versus 46%, p < 0.005) and a trend toward less dyspnea and weakness were reported by phenytoin-treated patients. Our phenytoin regimen produced acceptable serum phenytoin levels (10 to 25 micrograms/ml) in 96% of patients.<doc-sep>Expectant management in severe preeclampsia: does magnesium sulfate prevent the development of eclampsia?<doc-sep>Although magnesium sulfate has been traditional or standard treatment for severe preeclampsia and eclampsia to prevent convulsions, its efficiency has always been in doubt and its induced side-effects also make it controversial for use. In this study, 64 patients, diagnosed with severe preeclampsia, were randomized into group I (34 patients) managed with MgSO4, and group II (30 patients) managed without MgSO4. There were no occurrences of eclampsia in either group. Although there was no statistical significance in the final delivery method, group I had a higher rate in cesarean section, in which most were significantly due to fetal distress (p < 0.05). Furthermore, group I had significantly more babies with poor apgar score than group II (p = 0.019). During the treatment period for those with a gestational age of less than 34 weeks, there were two patients with abruptio placentae in group I and the treatment periods were noted to be longer in group II than in group I. From the results of monitoring serum magnesium level in group I, when therapeutic level was achieved, magnesium sulfate induced great discomfort which might have led to the deterioration of the patients' condition. According to this study, magnesium sulfate's minimal efficiency, and its adverse side-effects, also make magnesium sulfate a poor choice in the management of preeclampsia. Therefore, because of our poor understanding of the etiology of preeclampsia, suitable management should be undertaken without magnesium sulfate. Improvement of the patient's pathophysiological condition or termination of pregnancy as early as possible, is recommended.<doc-sep>A comparison of magnesium sulfate and nimodipine for the prevention of eclampsia.<doc-sep>Magnesium sulfate may prevent eclampsia by reducing cerebral vasoconstriction and ischemia. Nimodipine is a calcium-channel blocker with specific cerebral vasodilator activity. Our objective was to determine whether nimodipine is more effective than magnesium sulfate for seizure prophylaxis in women with severe preeclampsia.
                We conducted an unblinded, multicenter trial in which 1650 women with severe preeclampsia were randomly assigned to receive either nimodipine (60 mg orally every 4 hours) or intravenous magnesium sulfate (given according to the institutional protocol) from enrollment until 24 hours post partum. High blood pressure was controlled with intravenous hydralazine as needed. The primary outcome measure was the development of eclampsia, as defined by a witnessed tonic-clonic seizure.
                Demographic and clinical characteristics were similar in the two groups. The women who received nimodipine were more likely to have a seizure than those who received magnesium sulfate (21 of 819 [2.6 percent] vs. 7 of 831 [0.8 percent], P=0.01). The adjusted risk ratio for eclampsia associated with nimodipine, as compared with magnesium sulfate, was 3.2 (95 percent confidence interval, 1.1 to 9.1). The antepartum seizure rates did not differ significantly between groups, but the nimodipine group had a higher rate of postpartum seizures (9 of 819 [1.1 percent] vs. 0 of 831, P=0.01). There were no significant differences in neonatal outcome between the two groups. More women in the magnesium sulfate group than in the nimodipine group needed hydralazine to control blood pressure (54.3 percent vs. 45.7 percent, P<0.001).
                Magnesium sulfate is more effective than nimodipine for prophylaxis against seizures in women with severe preeclampsia.

3,"Long-term hospitalization and beta-mimetic therapy in the treatment of intrauterine growth retardation of unknown etiology.<doc-sep>A group of 98 third trimester pregnant women whose ultrasonographic studies raised the suspicion of intrauterine fetal growth retardation was studied. The patients were randomly assigned to two groups: Group A (Treatment group: 44 patients) and Group B (Control group: 54 patients). All patients were admitted to the hospital upon diagnosis for baseline evaluation. Those in Group A remained in the hospital until delivery (mean stay 15 +/- 5 days) and received treatment with 10 mg/t.i.d. of p.o. ritodrine. Group B patients were discharged after an average stay of 7 +/- 3 days. This group was not treated with ritodrine, and they were seen weekly in an outpatient setting. The prevalence of low-birth-weight infants for their gestational age was 47.73% in the treatment group and 40.74% in the control group. Of the deliveries in the treatment group, 40.9% were induced (half for fetal indications). In the control group 35.18% of the induced labors was (47.35% for fetal indications). Of the cases in the treatment group 18.18% were delivered by cesarean section, of which 62.5% were performed for fetal distress. The control group showed similar figures: 16.66% cesarean sections with 77.7% of them done for fetal distress. We observed an incidence of 20.45% of acute fetal distress in the study group against 12.96% in the control group. Such a difference is not statistically significant.

4,"Treatment of acute asthma: salbutamol via jet nebuliser vs spacer and metered dose inhaler.<doc-sep>To compare the efficacy of salbutamol delivered by jet nebuliser (JN) with salbutamol via a pressurised metered dose inhaler (PMDI) and a large volume spacer (Volumatic) for management of acute asthma.
                A total of 160 children aged from 4 to 12 years presenting to an Emergency Department with acute asthma.
                The study was of multicentre (n=5) randomised, double blind, parallel design. Children weighing less than 25 kg received salbutamol 2.5 mg via the JN or 600 microg (six puffs) from the PMDI. Children over 25 kg received salbutamol 5 mg via the JN or 1200 microg (12 puffs) via the PMDI. Clinical score (range 0-12) and PEF (over 7 years) were recorded at baseline and 15, 30, 45 and 60 mins post administration.
                The improvement from baseline at 30 min in the clinical score was 1.87 for JN and 1.43 for PMDI (P=0.09) and at 60 min was 2.15 for JN and 1.12 for PMDI (P=0.0001). The improvement in PEF at 30 min was 51 L min(-1) for JN and 27 L min(-1) for PMDI (P=0.0007) and at 60 min was 57 L min(-1) for JN and 31.5 L min(-1) for PMDI (P=0.001).
                Administration of salbutamol via a PMDI and a large volume spacer device provides effective relief in the management of acute asthma in children, but to a lesser extent than a jet nebuliser. This difference may represent a dose response effect.<doc-sep>Aerosolized metaproterenol in the treatment of asthmatics with severe airflow obstruction. Comparison of two delivery methods.<doc-sep>The bronchodilator response to metaproterenol delivered by metered-dose inhaler (MDI) with a spacer device (Aerochamber [A]) and by jet nebulizer was studied in 44 asthmatic patients who presented to the emergency department with acute severe (FEV1 less than 50 percent predicted) airflow obstruction. The delivery method was randomized, double-blinded and placebo controlled. The A group received one puff of metaproterenol every five minutes for a total of three puffs (1.95 mg). The jet nebulizer group received 15 mg of metaproterenol by continuous nebulization over ten minutes. Only about 2.75 mg of the original 15 mg delivered by jet nebulizer was calculated to be available for inhalation due to the inefficiencies of the delivery system. The mean percentage of improvement in FVC and FEV1 in the A group was 33.5 and 49.0 percent, respectively. The mean percentage of improvement in FVC and FEV1 in the jet nebulizer group was 22.8 and 33.0 percent, respectively. There was no significant difference in the mean percentage of improvement values between the two groups. We were unable to demonstrate a difference in bronchodilator response to metaproterenol delivered by MDI-A and jet nebulizer in emergency department asthmatics with acute severe airflow obstruction.<doc-sep>Equivalence of continuous flow nebulizer and metered-dose inhaler with reservoir bag for treatment of acute airflow obstruction.<doc-sep>Traditionally, patients with acute airflow obstruction are treated with bronchodilator aerosols delivered by continuous flow nebulizers. While bronchodilator administration with the metered dose inhaler (MDI) and reservoir or spacer attachment is as effective as administration with the nebulizer in most settings, the former has not been widely accepted for treatment of acute airway obstruction in the emergency room. We compared the efficacy of the continuous flow nebulizer to that of the MDI with InspirEase (reservoir spacer) in 75 patients (45 men and 30 women), ages 18-73 (chi 44 years) who presented to the emergency room with acute asthma and COPD. Subjects in each group (22 COPD and 53 asthma) were randomly assigned to treatment with three puffs of metaproterenol (0.65 mg/puff) via the MDI with InspirEase plus nebulizer with placebo, or placebo MDI with InspirEase plus nebulizer with 15 mg metaproterenol in double blind fashion. Either treatment was given three times at 30 min intervals. The FEV1 and dyspnea scores according to the Borg scale were measured at baseline, 30 min after the first treatment, and 30 min after the third. There was no significant outcome difference between the two treatments in either diagnostic group. There also was no significant outcome difference for patients with baseline FEV1 less than 0.9L. Serum theophylline levels, the need for concomitant therapy with corticosteroids, or additional emergency room therapy after the study, hospitalizations and treatment side effects did not differ between treatment groups. We conclude that there is no demonstrable advantage of a continuous flow nebulizer over an MDI with InspirEase for the treatment of acute airflow obstruction.<doc-sep>Comparative efficacy of terbutaline administered by Nebuhaler and by nebulizer in young children with acute asthma.<doc-sep>We compared the use of terbutaline sulphate that was delivered by a nebulizer with its delivery by a Nebuhaler at two dose levels in 27 children (nine children per group) of between three and six years of age with acute asthma. No significant difference was found in the mean baseline clinical score among the three groups, and a significant decline occurred in the mean clinical scores in all groups by 15 minutes which was maintained to 60 minutes after the dose was administered. The decline that was achieved with delivery of the drug by way of a Nebuhaler (at either dose level) was not significantly different from that with a nebulizer, although cooperation with Nebuhaler usage was not universal in the age-group.<doc-sep>Nebuhaler versus nebuliser in children with acute asthma.<doc-sep><doc-sep>A comparison of albuterol administered by metered dose inhaler (and holding chamber) or wet nebulizer in acute asthma.<doc-sep>Comparative studies of albuterol by wet nebulizer or metered dose inhaler have tested fixed doses of medications. We compared the dose-response relationship to albuterol by wet nebulization or metered dose inhaler in acute asthma.
                Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. Patients with acute asthma received either albuterol, 0.4 mg, by metered dose inhaler (and holding chamber) or albuterol, 2.5 mg, by wet nebulizer every 30 min until maximal bronchodilation. Forty patients (forced expiratory volume in 1 s [FEV1]: 1.15 +/- 0.43 L; 36 +/- 12 percent predicted) received metered dose inhaler and 40 others (FEV1: 1.08 +/- 0.52 L; 35 +/- 16 percent predicted) received wet nebulization.
                Twenty-six patients (65 percent) receiving metered dose inhaler and 30 (75 percent) receiving wet nebulization achieved maximal bronchodilation after two doses. Almost all reached maximal bronchodilation by four doses. The FEV1 improved by 0.72 +/- 0.49 L for metered dose inhaler and 0.68 +/- 0.61 L for wet nebulizer (p = 0.71). A significant linear relationship was seen in both groups (metered dose inhaler r = 0.94; wet nebulizer r = 0.98) between the log dose of albuterol and change in FEV1. About 1/6 the wet nebulizer dose of albuterol was needed to achieve similar response to the metered dose inhaler.
                Albuterol by metered dose inhaler provided similar bronchodilation to that achieved by wet nebulization in patients with acute asthma. The cumulative dose-response technique is applicable in the emergency department setting and is helpful in comparing the relative utility of various bronchodilator regimens.<doc-sep>Efficacy and safety of a home-made non-valved spacer for bronchodilator therapy in acute asthma.<doc-sep>The aim of this study was to assess the efficacy and safety of an alternative spacer to deliver salbutamol in acute asthma. A prospective randomized study was performed with 196 patients with acute asthma, aged 4-15 y. The clinical features, oxygen saturation (SaO2) and the best of three peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR) measurements were recorded in a standardized questionnaire. Each patient received up to three conventional doses of salbutamol through an alternative home-made non-valved spacer (NVS) (500 ml mineral water plastic bottle) or an oxygen-driven nebulizer (ODN). The clinical and functional respiratory parameters (PEFR and SaO2) were assessed 15 min after each administration of the bronchodilator. In the ODN (n = 99) and NVS (n = 97) groups, PEFR (p > 0.05) and SaO2 (p > 0.05) measurements improved in all stages of the treatment. During the asthma attacks, the ODN group needed a prolonged observation in the emergency room (p = 0.000000). Side effects of salbutamol, e.g. increased heart rate, were observed in 17.2% of the patients in the ODN group and 4.1% in the NVS group (p = 0.003).
                Both devices showed comparable efficacy in mild and moderate acute attacks, but the use of the alternative NVS resulted in a shorter observation period in the emergency room. The frequency of side effects was significantly higher in the ODN group than in the NVS group.<doc-sep>High-dose albuterol by metered-dose inhaler plus a spacer device versus nebulization in preschool children with recurrent wheezing: A double-blind, randomized equivalence trial.<doc-sep>Inhaled albuterol is the most frequently used bronchodilator for acute wheezing, and nebulization is the standard mode of delivery in hospital setting. However, recent guidelines consider spacer devices as an easier to use, and cost-saving alternative and recommend the high-dose metered-dose inhaler bronchodilator.
                To demonstrate clinical equivalence between a spacer device and a nebulizer for albuterol administration.
                Randomized, double-blind, parallel group equivalence trial.
                Pediatric emergency wards at 2 tertiary teaching hospitals.
                Sixty-four 12- to 60-month-old children with acute recurrent wheezing (32 per group).
                Albuterol was administered through the spacer device (50 microg/kg) or through the nebulizer (150 microg/kg) and repeated 3 times at 20-minute intervals. Parents completed a questionnaire.
                Pulmonary index, hospitalization, ease of use, acceptability, and pulse oximetry saturation.
                The 90% confidence interval of the difference between treatment groups for the median absolute changes in pulmonary index values between T0 and T60 was [-1; +1] and was included in the equivalence interval [-1.5; +1.5]. Clinical improvement increased with time. Less than 10% of the children (3 in each group) required hospitalization (2 in each group attributable to treatment failure). Parents considered administration of albuterol using the spacer device easier (94%) and better accepted by their children (62%).
                The efficacy of albuterol administered using the spacer device was equivalent to that of the nebulizer. Given its high tolerance, repeated 50-microg/kg doses of albuterol administered through the spacer device should be considered in hospital emergency departments as first-line therapy for wheezing.<doc-sep>Wet nebulizer versus spacer and metered dose inhaler via tidal breathing.<doc-sep><doc-sep>[Bronchodilation induced by fenoterol in asthmatic patients: comparison of jet nebulization and spacer device].<doc-sep>To compare bronchodilation attained by fenoterol administered through a jet nebulizer and through a spacer device.

                44 adults with asthma, peak-flow rate varying between 120 and 200 l/min. Patients were divided into two groups. TREATMENT [corrected]: Group A was treated with fenoterol (2.5 mg) with saline to complete 3 ml given through a jet nebulizer; 30 minutes later, an additional dose (1 mg) was given through a 500 ml spacer. Group B was treated with the same dosage, but the spacer [corrected] was used first.

                No significant difference in bronchodilation was seen between groups A and B.
                Fenoterol through a spacer can replace inhalation in adult asthma patients with non-severe obstruction. Lower cost and home treatment are the main advantages.<doc-sep>[Comparison of treatment of acute asthma attacks in children with salbutamol dispensed by the Volumatic dispenser or by a nebulizer].<doc-sep>Eighteen children with acute asthma were administered equal doses of Salbutamol either through a nebulizer and face mask or a dose-metered inhaler, spacer (Volumatic) and tidal breathing mechanism. Consecutive doses at twenty minute intervals were administered until either no significant improvement in pulmonary function was observed or until a cumulative dose of 0.15 mg/Kg (maximum of 5 mgs) had been given. All subjects finally received a dose of 0.15 mg/Kg (maximum of 5 mgs) of nebulized Salbutamol at the end of the study. No difference in bronchodilation was obvious between the methods of treatment. No significant side-effect was observed in any patient. Treatment of acute asthma in children with Salbutamol via a pressurized inhaler, spacer and tidal breathing mechanism may be an efficacious, safe and readily available method, but further work is needed before it can be recommended for routine home management of asthma attacks.<doc-sep>Treatment of acute severe asthma with inhaled albuterol delivered via jet nebulizer, metered dose inhaler with spacer, or dry powder.<doc-sep>Despite the increasing use of dry powder formulations in the ambulatory setting, there is a paucity of information on the efficacy of this therapeutic modality to treat acute severe asthma. In addition, studies that compared wet nebulization vs metered dose inhalers formulated with chlorofluorocarbon (CFCMDI) attached to holding chambers have yielded discrepant results. Thus, it is unclear which of the three delivery systems would elicit a superior bronchodilator response, particularly in patients with life-threatening asthma. In a prospective, randomized open design, we studied the response to inhaled albuterol (salbutamol) in 27 adult asthmatics presenting to the emergency department (ED) with an FEV1 <30% predicted. Subjects were treated with one of the following regimens (nine subjects in each group): group A, mean (SD) baseline FEV1 of 0.7 (0.2) L, received albuterol solution, 5 mg, via a nebulizer (Puritan-Bennett Raindrop; Lawrenceville, Ga) impelled with oxygen (O2) at 8 L/min; group B, baseline FEV1 of 0.6 (0.15) L, received albuterol, 400 microg, via a CFCMDI attached to a 145-mL valved aerosol holding chamber (Aerochamber; Trudell Medical; London, ON); and group C, baseline FEV1 of 0.6 (0.17) L, received albuterol powder, 400 microg, by another means (Rotahaler; Glaxo; Research Triangle Park, NC). All groups received the respective treatments on arrival in the ED, every 30 min during the first 2 h, and then hourly until the sixth hour. Clinical parameters and FEV1 were recorded on ED admission and 15 min after each dose of albuterol. At the time of ED admission, all patients also received continuous O2 and one dose of I.V. steroids (dexamethasone, 8 mg). The total dose of inhaled albuterol administered during the 6-h treatment was 45 mg of nebulized solution in group A and 3,600 microg of albuterol aerosol and dry powder in groups B and C, respectively. No significant differences were found in the population demographics, baseline FEV1, and arterial blood gas values on air. FEV1 improved significantly in all patients after the 6 h of treatment. The 6-h area under the curve FEV1 improved similarly with the three delivery methods despite differences in the total dose administered. No patient was discontinued during the trial or admitted to hospital and no evidence of cardiovascular adverse events was apparent in any of the study groups. These data support the view that the three delivery methods appear adequate to treat subjects with acute severe asthma.<doc-sep>Efficacy of albuterol administered by nebulizer versus spacer device in children with acute asthma.<doc-sep>The aim of this study was to compare the response to inhaled albuterol after administration by nebulizer with the response after administration by a metered-dose inhaler and spacer device (MDI-spacer) to children with acute asthma. In a double-blind fashion, 33 children (6 to 14 years of age) with forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) between 20% and 70% of predicted values, and who were seen in the emergency department with acute asthma, were studied. They were treated with aerosolized albuterol or placebo by MDI-spacer, followed immediately by albuterol or placebo administered by nebulizer with oxygen. The dose ratio for albuterol by MDI-spacer versus nebulizer was 1:5. Outcome measures included a clinical score, respiratory rate, arterial oxygen saturation, and FEV1, measured before and 10, 20, and 40 minutes after treatment. With the exception of heart rate (which increased in the nebulizer group and decreased in the MDI-spacer group (p < 0.05), no difference in the rate of improvement of clinical score, respiratory rate, arterial oxygen saturation, or FEV1 was noted during the 40-minute study period between children who received albuterol by nebulizer and those who received it by MDI-spacer. We conclude that spacers and nebulizers are equally effective means of delivering beta 2-agonists to children with acute asthma.<doc-sep>Management of acute asthma in children using metered dose inhaler and small volume nebulizer.<doc-sep>To determine whether the administration of beta2-agonist by Metered Dose inhaler (MDI) with accessory device (AD) is a as effective as the administration of beta2-agonist by small volume nebulizers (SVN) for the treatment of acute asthma.
                A cross sectional study was conducted at Emergency Room (ER) of National Institute of Child Health (NICH), Karachi, between October 2000 to March 2001. This study included 150 children, 6 months and older with a history of wheeze and presenting with an acute asthma exacerbation. Children were categorized into mild, moderate and severe asthma according to medical scoring system. Children were assigned randomly into group A and B to receive standard dose of beta2-agonist (salbutamol) by MDI/AD (group A) or SVN (group B). Baseline characteristics and asthma severity were recorded. All variables (dyspnoea, use of accessory muscles, cyanosis, respiratory rate, heart rate, blood pressure, oxygen saturation, pulsus paradoxus, and wheeze) and Peak Expiratory Flow Rate (PEFR) in children 5 years and older, were determined at pre and post inhalation therapy.

PEFR increased significantly in both the groups after completion of treatment, but PEFR was not statistically significant when compared in between groups.

                Emergency Room.
                In 60 subjects with acute asthma aged between 1 to 12 years, clinical and laboratory assessment of severity at recruitment included heart rate, respiratory rate, pulsus paradoxus, arterial blood gas analysis (all cases) and peak expiratory flow rate (wherever possible). The subjects were randomized into two equal groups to receive aerosolized salbutamol either via nebulizer (Group I) or MDI-spacer (Group II) as per the Consensus Guidelines. The response to therapy was sequentially assessed after 20, 40 and 60 minutes of institution of therapy.
                A significantly (p < 0.02) greater number of subjects in Group II presented with severe dyspnea and intercostal muscle retraction (subjective assessment). However, the objectively evaluable outcome parameters were comparable (p > 0.05) in both groups at presentation. All the outcome measures showed a significant (p < 0.05) improvement with time in both the groups. The recovery parameters were comparable (p > 0.05) at different time periods in the two groups.
                MDI-spacer is as effective as a nebulizer for the aerosolized administration of salbutamol in an acute exacerbation of asthma in children. However, for developing countries, distinct advantages (economic and power requirement) argue strongly for utilization of MDI-spacer in preference to nebulizer.<doc-sep>[Different inhaler devices in acute asthma attacks: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study].<doc-sep>To verify the efficacy, side effects, and cost of treatment of acute asthma attacks, using different inhaler devices.
                This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. Salbutamol was administered via a nebulizer, a metered-dose inhaler (attached to a commercially available spacer device), a homemade non-valved spacer device, or a dry powder inhaler. Assessments were made at zero, 20, 40 and 60 minutes, followed by the application of salbutamol and placebo with another device. Forty children (mean age of 11+/-3.5 years) with acute asthma attacks, were evaluated. Clinical score, forced expiratory volume in one second and side effects were analyzed. The costs for medication and spacer devices were calculated.
                There is no difference between groups regarding clinical score and variation of forced expiratory volume in one second. There was a major variation in the heart rate response to the nebulizer (35%) compared to the commercially available spacer and dry powder inhaler (15 and 17%) and between the homemade spacer and the commercially available spacer (28 and 15%) (p = 0.004). The nebulizer and homemade spacer caused more tremor (p = 0.02). The cost of treatment was higher for the nebulizer and commercially available spacer (p = 0.0001).
                The nebulizer was more expensive and used more medicine, showing the same efficiency. The homemade spacer was cheaper, but presented more side effects. The commercially available spacer was as expensive as the nebulizer, although safer. The dry powder inhaler was cheaper, but, just as the homemade spacer, it also caused tachycardia.<doc-sep>Salbutamol treatment of acute severe asthma in the ED: MDI versus hand-held nebulizer.<doc-sep>The objectives of this study were to compare the efficacy of salbutamol delivered by either metered-dose inhaler plus spacer (MDI-spacer) or by wet nebulization (NEB), and to determine the relationships between physiologic responses and plasma salbutamol concentrations. Asthmatic patients presenting to the emergency department (ED) with acute severe asthma (forced expiratory volume in the first second [FEV1] less than 50% of predicted) were enrolled in a randomized, double-blind, parallel-group study. The MDI-spacer group received salbutamol, delivered via MDI into a spacer device, in four puffs actuated in rapid succession at 10-minute intervals (2.4 mg/h). The NEB group was treated with nebulized salbutamol, 1.5 mg, via nebulizer at 15-minute intervals (6 mg/h). Doses were calculated on the basis of the percentage of total dose that reaches the lower airway with both methods. The protocol involved 3 hours of this treatment. Mean peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR) and FEV1 improved significantly over baseline values for both groups (P=.01). However, there were no significant differences between both groups for PEFR and FEV1 at any point studied. The examination of the relationships between cumulative dose of salbutamol and change in FEV1 showed a significant linear relationship (P=.01) for both methods (MDI r=.97; NEB r=.97). The regression equations showed that for every 1 mg of salbutamol by MDI-spacer, 2.5 mg are needed from nebulization to have equal therapeutic response. At the end of treatment, the salbutamol plasma levels were 10.1+/-1.6 ng/ml for the MDI-spacer group and 14.4+/-2.3 ng/ml for the NEB group (P=.0003). Both groups showed a nonsignificant heart rate decrease. A significant group-by-time interaction means that differences between groups increased with time (P=.04). Additionally, the NEB group presented a higher incidence of tremor (P=.03) and anxiety (P=.04), reflecting larger systemic absorption of salbutamol. These data indicate that when doses used are calculated on the basis of the percentage of total drug that reaches the lower airway, there was equivalent bronchodilatation after salbutamol administered by either MDI-spacer or nebulization in patients with acute severe asthma. However, nebulizer therapy produced greater side effects related to the increase in salbutamol absorption and higher plasma level.<doc-sep>Comparison of beta-adrenergic agents delivered by nebulizer vs metered dose inhaler with InspirEase in hospitalized asthmatic patients.<doc-sep>The present study was undertaken to determine if beta-agonists delivered by nebulizer provide better clinical responses than MDI therapy in status asthmaticus. We divided 28 hospitalized asthmatic patients into three groups. Group 1 received albuterol by MDI with InspirEase. Group 2 received nebulized albuterol. Group 3 received nebulized metaproterenol. Both nebulizer regimens resulted in significant improvements in both FVC and FEV1 by 30 min after initial hospital beta-agonist treatment. No significant improvement was noted in initial spirometry in the MDI with InspirEase group. In spite of the superiority of nebulizer therapy in the initial phase of hospitalization, the daily rates of spirometric improvement and duration of hospitalization were not significantly different among the three groups. Our results indicate that nebulizer therapy provides superior spirometric improvement in the initial phase of status asthmaticus. However, both MDI and nebulizer regimens provided similar rates of spirometric improvement and duration of hospitalization.<doc-sep>Delivery of albuterol in a pediatric emergency department.<doc-sep>To determine if albuterol delivery by the combination of a metered-dose inhaler (MDI) with a spacer is equal in effectiveness to nebulization in a pediatric emergency department setting.

                Urban children's hospital emergency department.
                Patients > or = six years of age with the diagnosis of acute asthma exacerbation. Exclusion criteria consisted of impending respiratory failure and corticosteroid administration within the preceding seven days.
                Patients were randomized into either the nebulizer treatment group or one of two MDI-spacer treatment groups (two spacers were evaluated). Each patient received three albuterol treatments administered evenly over one hour. The dose ratio for albuterol by nebulizer versus MDI-spacer was 6.9:1. Outcome was assessed by comparing the pre- and posttreatment percent predicted respiratory rate and percent predicted peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR) for each patient.
                Sixty patients were enrolled in the study. All three treatment groups showed significant improvement following albuterol therapy in both percent predicted respiratory rate and percent predicted PEFR. When comparing the three groups against each other in regard to outcome, no significant differences were found in improvement of percent predicted respiratory rate (P = 0.3258) or percent predicted PEFR (P = 0.9362).

                A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled intervention study conducted at two sites.
                The EDs of a large municipal hospital and a university teaching hospital.
                Thirty-five patients 10 to 45 years of age seeking treatment at an ED for acute asthma.
                Patients were randomly assigned to receive either albuterol by nebulizer plus placebo by inhaler (n = 20) or albuterol by inhaler plus placebo by nebulizer (n = 15). The dose was repeated every 30 min until the FEV1 was at least 80 percent of predicted, the patient became asymptomatic, or 6 doses had been given.
                All references in this article to spirometric measurements of forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1), forced vital capacity (FVC), and peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR) represent percentages of the predicted normal value. No significant (p > 0.58) differences occurred in baseline mean FEV1, FVC, or PEFR for the two groups. For both groups, significant improvement occurred in mean FEV1 at 30 min (p < 0.02) and at 60 min (p < 0.02), and in maximum mean FEV1 (p < 0.001). However, no significant (p > 0.6) differences occurred between groups in mean FEV1, FVC, or PEFR at 30 and 60 min, or in maximum improvement attained. The sample size was sufficiently large to detect a 12 percent difference in improvement with a power of 90 percent. Thirty-three of 35 patients were treated successfully with the study protocol, became asymptomatic, and were discharged home. One patient from each group required further treatment.
                There was no detectable difference in effectiveness of albuterol administered by nebulizer or the inhaler system for treatment of acute asthma. There was no detectable difference in effectiveness of albuterol administered by nebulizer or the inhaler system for the treatment of acute asthma when the dose was titrated to clinical response. When compared with nebulizer, the metered-dose inhaler with holding chamber delivers a full dose of albuterol more quickly and at no higher cost.<doc-sep>Costs and effectiveness of spacer versus nebulizer in young children with moderate and severe acute asthma.<doc-sep>To compare the costs and effectiveness of albuterol by metered dose inhaler (MDI) and spacer versus nebulizer in young children with moderate and severe acute asthma.
                Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in an emergency department at a children's hospital. The participants were children 1 to 4 years of age with moderate to severe acute asthma. Patients assigned to the spacer group received albuterol (600 microg) by MDI by spacer (AeroChamber) followed by placebo by nebulizer (n = 30). The nebulizer group received placebo MDI by spacer followed by 2.5 mg albuterol by nebulizer (n = 30). Treatments were repeated at 20-minute intervals until the patient was judged to need no further doses of bronchodilator, or a total of 6 treatments.
                Clinical score, heart rate, respiratory rate, auscultatory findings, and oxygen saturation were recorded at baseline, after each treatment, and 60 minutes after the last treatment. Baseline characteristics and asthma severity were similar for the treatment groups. The spacer was as effective as the nebulizer for clinical score, respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation but produced a greater reduction in wheezing (P =.03). Heart rate increased to a greater degree in the nebulizer group (11.0/min vs 0.17/min for spacer, P <.01). Fewer children in the spacer group required admission (33% vs 60% in the nebulizer group, P =.04, adjusted for sex). No differences were seen in rates of tremor or hyperactivity. The mean cost of each emergency department presentation was NZ$825 for the spacer group and NZ$1282 for the nebulizer group (P =.03); 86% of children and 85% of parents preferred the spacer.
                The MDI and spacer combination was a cost-effective alternative to a nebulizer in the delivery of albuterol to young children with moderate and severe acute asthma.<doc-sep>Metered dose inhaler and nebuliser in acute asthma.<doc-sep>One hundred and eleven children with acute asthma were studied to compare delivery of terbutaline by either a metered dose inhaler (MDI) with a valved holding chamber or a nebuliser driven by air. Eligible patients were randomised; the MDI group received three puffs (0.75 mg) of terbutaline and the nebuliser group received 2 ml (5.0 mg) terbutaline solution diluted with 2 ml 0.9% saline for inhalation over 10 minutes. Patients were evaluated by spirometry, pulse oximetry, and clinical severity scoring system at baseline and again 15 minutes after the beginning of treatment. The baseline data of the two groups were not significantly different. All parameters of spirometry, except the peak expiratory flow (PEF) for the nebuliser group, and clinical severity score for both groups significantly improved after terbutaline treatment. Compared with the nebuliser group, the MDI group after treatment had better mean (SD) oxygen saturation (SaO2; 96.82 (1.63)% v 95.44 (1.88)%), frequency of oxygen desaturation (23.2% v 47.3%), absolute increase of PEF (32.6 (37.7) l/min v 10.2 (34.7) l/min), and SaO2 (0.54 (1.64)% v -0.47 (1.84)%). There was also a mean (SD) per cent increase of forced expiratory volume in one second (22.9 (21.0)% v 15.4 (16.1)%), PEF (27.7 (38.4)%) v 7.7 (25.1)%), and SaO2 (0.58 (1.72)% v -0.47 (1.93)%). In conclusion, aerosol treatment by MDI (with a valved holding chamber) in this study proved to be superior to nebuliser treatment in terms of SaO2 and some measurements of spirometry. Respiratory therapists working with children with severe asthma should be aware of the possibility of oxygen desaturation, especially when using room air as the driving gas for nebulisation.<doc-sep>Metered-dose inhalers with spacers vs nebulizers for pediatric asthma.<doc-sep>To determine whether the administration of beta-agonists by metered-dose inhaler (MDI) with a spacer device is as effective as the administration of beta-agonists by nebulizer for the treatment of acute asthma exacerbations in children.
                Randomized trial with two arms.
                Urban pediatric emergency department (ED) in Bronx, NY.
                Convenience sample of 152 children 2 years and older with a history of at least two episodes of wheezing presenting to the ED with an acute asthma exacerbation.
                Patients were randomly assigned to receive standard doses of a beta-agonist (albuterol) by an MDI with spacer or by a nebulizer. Dosing intervals and the use of other medications were determined by the treating physician.
                Baseline characteristics and asthma history were recorded. Asthma severity score, peak expiratory flow rate in children 5 years or older, and oxygen saturation were determined at presentation and before admission or discharge. The groups did not differ in age, sex, ethnicity, age of onset of asthma, or asthma severity score at presentation. There were no significant differences between the groups in outcomes, including mean changes in respiratory rate, asthma severity score, and peak expiratory flow rate, oxygen saturation, number of treatments given, administration of steroids in the ED, and admission rate. Patients given MDIs with spacers required shorter treatment times in the ED (66 minutes vs 103 minutes, P < .001). Fewer patients in the spacer group had episodes of vomiting in the ED (9% vs 20%, P < .04), and patients in the nebulizer group had a significantly greater mean percent increase in heart rate from baseline to final disposition (15% vs 5%, P < .001).
                These data suggest that MDIs with spacers may be an effective alternative to nebulizers for the treatment of children with acute asthma exacerbations in the ED.<doc-sep>A randomised controlled trial to assess the relative benefits of large volume spacers and nebulisers to treat acute asthma in hospital.<doc-sep>To compare the clinical effectiveness, acceptability, and cost benefit of administering beta2 agonists by means of a metered dose inhaler and large volume spacer with conventional nebulisers to children admitted to hospital with acute asthma.
                A randomised controlled trial was conducted over five months. Sixty one children older than 3 years admitted to a large teaching hospital and a district general hospital with acute asthma completed the study. Children received either 5 mg of salbutamol up to one hourly by jet nebuliser, or up to 10 puffs of salbutamol 100 microg by means of a metered dose inhaler and spacer up to one hourly.
                Median hospital stay was 40 hours in the nebuliser group and 36.5 hours in the spacer group. Asthma disability scores at two weeks after discharge were significantly improved in the spacer group. Drug costs were pound 14.62 less for each patient in the spacer group.
                Large volume spacers are an acceptable, cost effective alternative to nebulisers in treating children admitted with acute asthma, provided that the children can use the mouthpiece, and symptoms are not severe. Their use facilitates effective home treatment by parents, with subsequent reduction in morbidity and re-admission rates.<doc-sep>",Metered-dose inhalers with spacer produced outcomes that were at least equivalent to nebuliser delivery. Spacers may have some advantages compared to nebulisers for children with acute asthma.,There is insufficient evidence to determine whether the use of a nebulizer is superior to a combination of inhaled and metered dose inhalers in the treatment of acute asthma.,CD000052
5,"Schizophrenia: a study comparing a family therapy group following a paradoxical model plus psychodrugs and a group treated by the conventional clinical approach.<doc-sep>A 'short family therapy' in schizophrenia, according to a specific systemic model (the 'Elementary Pragmatic Model' or EPM) with a strong paradoxical structure is presented. A total of 38 schizophrenic patients, randomly allocated, were treated according to the EPM model combined with psychotropic drugs (19 cases, each of whom underwent 10 weekly sessions of family therapy) or a traditional clinical-pharmacological approach (19 cases). With regard to all measures (number of drop-outs, symptoms according to the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale, social activity according to the Strauss-Carpenter Outcome Scale and an interactive test) the EPM group showed better results. It is suggested that the systemic approach could be used not only as an effective therapy model in schizophrenia but also as an intervention in addition to or integrated into an ongoing psychoeducational family therapy.<doc-sep>Randomized controlled trial of motivational interviewing, cognitive behavior therapy, and family intervention for patients with comorbid schizophrenia and substance use disorders.<doc-sep>Comorbidity of substance abuse disorders with schizophrenia is associated with a greater risk for serious illness complications and poorer outcome. Methodologically sound studies investigating treatment approaches for patients with these disorders are rare, although recommendations for integrated and comprehensive treatment programs abound. This study investigates the relative benefit of adding an integrated psychological and psychosocial treatment program to routine psychiatric care for patients with schizophrenia and substance use disorders.
                The authors conducted a randomized, single-blind controlled comparison of routine care with a program of routine care integrated with motivational interviewing, cognitive behavior therapy, and family or caregiver intervention.
                The integrated treatment program resulted in significantly greater improvement in patients' general functioning than routine care alone at the end of treatment and 12 months after the beginning of the study. Other benefits of the program included a reduction in positive symptoms and in symptom exacerbations and an increase in the percent of days of abstinence from drugs or alcohol over the 12-month period from baseline to follow-up.
                These findings demonstrate the effectiveness of a program of routine care integrated with motivational interviewing, cognitive behavior therapy, and family intervention over routine psychiatric care alone for patients with comorbid schizophrenia and alcohol or drug abuse or dependence.<doc-sep>The impact of therapeutic relatives' groups on the course of illness of schizophrenic patients.<doc-sep>This study considers the question of whether relapse rates among schizophrenic patients can be reduced by means of relatives' groups. In a randomized, controlled intervention study, two therapeutic strategies (therapeutic relatives' groups, initiated relatives' self-help groups) were compared with each other and with a control group. Interventions were confined to the relatives, with the patients continuing their standard treatment. The study involved 151 relatives of 99 chronic DSMIII schizophrenics. Data were collected before and after a 1-year intervention phase and in a 2-year follow-up. No difference existed between the groups with respect to rehospitalization data. However, numerous differences recorded in the psychopathological findings and in living and working circumstances suggest that therapeutic work with relatives is of clinically significant benefit.<doc-sep>Educating relatives about schizophrenia.<doc-sep>An education program, which was part of a controlled trial of intervention with families of schizophrenic patients, is described and evaluated. The evidence suggests that this kind of education has a role to play in psychosocial intervention.

The particular foci were on themes that arose during sessions, principal therapeutic interventions offered, and caveats for counselors working in the field. The most striking finding was the diverse range of themes, covering personal, coping, family, and social aspects of the caregiving experience. This required a correspondingly broad array of interventions. The implications are clear: confining counseling for caregivers to such traditional dimensions as education or attempts to reduce emotional expressiveness denies them the opportunity to deal with other equally relevant concerns.<doc-sep>Family psychoeducational support groups in schizophrenia.<doc-sep>Family members of 55 patients with schizophrenia were randomly assigned to a psychoeducational support group or to a control group. Support group participants showed greater knowledge of schizophrenia and greater satisfaction with health care services than did control group members. Psychological distress, coping behavior, and family satisfaction did not appear affected by support group participation; nor were support groups associated with lower rehospitalization rates for patients.<doc-sep>The Sydney intervention trial: a controlled trial of relatives' counselling to reduce schizophrenic relapse.<doc-sep>The result of a psychosocial intervention which aimed to reduce schizophrenic relapse through relatives' counselling is presented. Thirty-six schizophrenic patients living in high Expressed Emotion (EE) parental households were randomly allocated to an intervention or control group. The parents of patients allocated to the intervention were offered ten weekly sessions of counselling. The patient was not included in these sessions. Patients in both groups received standard after-care of medication and support. Relapses in the intervention group, although fewer, were not significantly different from the control group. Given the impressive evidence in favour of family interventions in reducing relapse rates in schizophrenic patients possible reasons for this result are discussed. Aspects of the intervention described here, exclusion of the patient, no control over the patients' medication or involvement with their management, short duration of intervention and lack of individual assessment, could explain this finding. This negative result is important in indicating what factors should be included in an effective psychosocial intervention.<doc-sep>Three-year trials of personal therapy among schizophrenic patients living with or independent of family, I: Description of study and effects on relapse rates.<doc-sep>The study of individual psychotherapeutic approaches to the treatment of schizophrenia has yielded equivocal findings, partly because of methodologic problems. Further, the ability of psychosocial treatments to prevent psychotic relapse appears to lessen over time. The authors' goal was to develop and test a demonstrably effective individual therapy for schizophrenia.
                Using a study design that addressed previous methodologic issues, the authors evaluated personal therapy specifically designed to forestall late relapse in patients with schizophrenia. They evaluated the effectiveness of personal therapy over a period of 3 years after hospital discharge among 151 patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder diagnosed according to Research Diagnostic Criteria. The patients were randomly assigned to receive either personal therapy or contrasting therapies in one of two concurrent trials. One trial studied patients who were living with family (N = 97); the other studied patients who were living independent of family (N = 54).
                All of the patients had extensive psychiatric histories, but only 44 (29%) experienced recurrent psychotic episodes over the 3-year study period, and only 27 (18%) prematurely terminated the study; most of those who left the study were in the no-personal-therapy conditions. Among patients living with family, personal therapy was more effective than family and supportive therapies in preventing psychotic and affective relapse as well as noncompliance. However, among patients living independent of family, those who received personal therapy had significantly more psychotic decompensations than did those who received supportive therapy.
                Personal therapy had a positive effect on adverse outcomes among patients who lived with family. However, personal therapy increased the rate of psychotic relapse for patients living independent of family. The application of personal therapy might best be delayed until patients have achieved symptom and residential stability.<doc-sep>Patient functioning and family burden in a controlled, real-world trial of family psychoeducation for schizophrenia.<doc-sep>This study explored the effectiveness of a psychoeducational family intervention for schizophrenia on patients' personal and social functioning as well as on relatives' burden and perceived support.
                Thirty-four mental health professionals from 17 public mental health centers in Italy selected 71 families of consumers with schizophrenia. Forty-two families were randomly assigned to a group that received the intervention for six months, and 29 families were assigned to a waiting list for six months. At baseline and six months later, validated tools were used to assess patients' clinical status, personal and social functioning, and social network as well as relatives' burden, social resources, and perception of professional support.
                In the intervention group the number of patients with poor or very poor global personal and social functioning decreased significantly, from 17 (47 percent) at baseline to nine (25 percent) at follow-up. A significant improvement was found for the intervention group in patients' social relationships, interests in obtaining a job, maintenance of social interests, and management of social conflicts. Twenty-seven patients (74 percent) reported that their social relationships had improved during the six-month period. For both the intervention and control groups, family burden significantly improved. Relatives' social contacts and perception of professional support significantly increased only in the intervention group.
                The results suggest that a psychoeducational family intervention may have a significant impact on functional outcomes of schizophrenia when provided to patients and caregivers in real-world settings.<doc-sep>A trial of family therapy v. a relatives group for schizophrenia.<doc-sep>Schizophrenic patients living in high contact with relatives having high expressed emotion (EE) were recruited for a trial of social interventions. The patients were maintained on neuroleptic medication, while their families were randomly assigned to education plus family therapy or education plus a relatives group. Eleven out of 12 families accepted family therapy in the home, whereas only six out of 11 families were compliant with the relatives group. Non-compliance was associated with a poorer outcome for the patients in terms of the relapse rate. The relapse rate over nine months in the family therapy stream was 8%, while that in compliant families in the relatives group stream was 17%. Patients' social functioning showed small, non-significant, gains. The data from the current trial were compared with data from a previous trial. The lowering of the relapse rate in schizophrenia appears to be mediated by reductions in relatives' EE and/or face-to-face contact, and is not explained by better compliance with medication. Reduction in EE and/or contact was associated with a minuscule relapse rate (5%). Very little change occurred in families who were non-compliant with the relatives group. On the basis of these findings, we recommend that the most cost-effective procedure is to establish relatives groups in conjunction with family education and one or more initial family therapy sessions in the home. It is particularly important to offer home visits to families who are unable to or refuse to attend the relatives groups.<doc-sep>The community management of schizophrenia. A controlled trial of a behavioural intervention with families to reduce relapse.<doc-sep>Schizophrenic patients were recruited into a trial of a prophylactic behavioural intervention with families. Families with at least one high Expressed Emotion (EE) relative were randomly allocated to one of four intervention groups: Behavioural Intervention Enactive; Behavioural Intervention Symbolic; Education Only; Routine Treatment. Patients from low-EE families were randomly allocated to two groups: Education Only or Routine Treatment. Relapse rates over nine months after discharge were significantly lower for patients in the two Behavioural Intervention, compared with Education Only and Routine Treatment groups. There was little difference between the two low-EE groups. Patients returning to high-EE relatives showed significantly higher relapse rates than those returning to low-EE relatives, in groups not receiving active intervention. Changes from high to low EE occurred in the Behavioural Intervention groups, and similar although less extensive changes occurred in the Education Only and Routine Treatment groups. Changes in criticism and marked emotional over-involvement (EOI) occurred generally in high-EE groups but were larger in magnitude in the Enactive and Symbolic groups. Reduction of hostility only occurred in the Behavioural Intervention groups. These results give partial support for the causal role of EE in relapse. There were no significant differences between the groups with respect to contact with the psychiatric services or medication.<doc-sep>Family treatment for schizophrenia : the design and research application of therapist training models.<doc-sep>The NIMH Treatment Strategies in Schizophrenia (TSS) collaborative study group investigated the efficacy of antisychotic drug maintenance strategies involving reduced medication exposure in interaction with applied and supportive family management for the long-term treatment of schizophrenia.

They were trained by two of the authors, I.R.H.F and C.W.M, in applied family management, a homebased treatment derived from the behavioral family therapy developed by them. Clinicians' characteristics, selection, and training methods, as well as patient rehospitalization rates, are reported for the two family management conditions.

                Relatives were randomly provided with an informative programme (n = 50), or allocated to receive an additional support programme (n = 26). Patients did not attend the programme to overcome cultural and organizational implementation barriers. The 12 and 24 months clinical and family outcomes were assessed.
                Patients' compliance with standard care was greater at 12 months in the more intensive behavioural management group over a control group receiving treatment as usual (TAU) (n = 25). A reduction in levels of expressed emotion (EE), significantly more frequent in those receiving the additional support programme than just the informative, occurred after treatment completion. Other clinical and family outcomes did not differ. However, treatment benefits declined at 24 months, when baseline high EE was again predictive of patient's admission and relatives were more vulnerable to objective burden. Baseline illness severity variables predicted a number of medium and long-term poor clinical outcomes.
                Although family psychoeducation has been tested in a wide range of Anglo-Saxon settings, there remains need to assess outcomes more internationally. Effective family interventions for people with schizophrenia probably require continued administration of key-elements or ongoing informal support to deal with the vicissitudes of illnesses.<doc-sep>Multiple-family group treatment for English- and Vietnamese-speaking families living with schizophrenia.<doc-sep>This study, which was the first evaluation in Australia of multiple-family group treatment, explored the effectiveness of this approach for a newly arrived non-English speaking migrant group, first-generation Vietnamese families, and for English-speaking families.
                Thirty-four pairs of English-speaking consumers and family members and 25 Vietnamese-speaking pairs were randomly assigned to a multiple-family group or a control group. All consumers had a diagnosis of schizophrenia. The multiple-family group intervention (26 sessions over 12 months) was delivered as an adjunct to case management services, which all consumers received. Outcomes, which were measured immediately after treatment and 18 months later, included the number of relapse episodes; the presence and severity of symptoms, as measured by the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) and the Scale for the Assessment of Negative Symptoms; and social functioning, as measured by the Family Burden Scale, the Health of the Nation Outcome Scale, and the Quality of Life Scale.
                Relapse rates immediately after treatment were significantly lower for the multiple-family group than for the control group (12 and 36 percent), and relapse rates were also lower during the follow-up period (25 and 63 percent). BPRS ratings were significantly lower for participants in the multiple-family group, and vocational outcomes also improved. The reductions in relapse and symptoms were similar for the English-speaking and the Vietnamese-speaking family groups; sample size precluded statistical analysis of differences.
                Multiple-family group treatment is an effective cognitive-behavioral intervention in the treatment of schizophrenia. The findings suggest continued application of and research on family interventions for non-English speaking migrant populations.<doc-sep>Family-based intervention for schizophrenic patients in China. A randomised controlled trial.<doc-sep>We developed and evaluated a comprehensive, ongoing intervention for families of schizophrenic patients appropriate for China's complex family relationships and unique social environment.
                Sixty-three DSM-III-R schizophrenic patients living with family members were enrolled when admitted to hospital and randomly assigned to receive standard care or a family-based intervention that included monthly 45-minute counselling sessions focused on the management of social and occupational problems, medication management, family education, family group meetings, and crisis intervention.
                At 6, 12, and 18-month follow-ups by blind evaluators, the proportion of subjects rehospitalised was lower, the duration of rehospitalisation was shorter, and the duration of employment was longer in the experimental group than in the control group; these differences were statistically significant at the 12 and 18-month follow-ups and were not explained by differences in drug compliance. Family intervention was associated with significantly lower levels of family burden.
                This intervention is less costly than standard treatment, is suitable for urban families of schizophrenic patients in China and feasible given the constraints of the Chinese mental health system.<doc-sep>A randomized controlled trial of a mutual support group for family caregivers of patients with schizophrenia.<doc-sep>This randomized controlled trial examined the effectiveness of a 12-session mutual support group conducted over 3-months for Chinese family caregivers of a relative with schizophrenia compared with routine family support services in Hong Kong. Forty-eight family caregivers from two psychiatric outpatient clinics were allocated randomly to an experimental (mutual support and usual outpatient care) group (n = 24) or a control (usual outpatient care only) group (n = 24). Data were collected prior to, 1 week and 3 months after the intervention. Families allocated to the mutual support group experienced decreased levels of family burden and increased family functioning and these changes were significantly greater than those of the controls at both post-intervention time points. The experimental group also showed a significant decrease in the duration of patient re-hospitalization (the total number of days of psychiatric hospitalization) at 3 months compared with the control group. This suggests that the mutual support group provided a more responsive service for patients than standard care. However, there was no significant difference in family service utilization between the two groups. The findings indicate that a mutual support group can provide benefits for family caregivers of people with schizophrenia that go beyond those provided by routine family support.

                A total of 106 outpatients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder who were receiving services from a large community mental health center were randomly assigned to receive standard care or standard care plus multiple-family group treatment. The two-year multiple-family intervention consisted of weekly group sessions designed to educate patients and their family members about the biological basis of mental illness and treatment, to improve illness management and coping skills, and to provide social support. The group sessions were conducted by two clinicians using a standardized protocol. Each multiple-family group included five to eight families and consumers. Service records for the year before and after random assignment to the study groups were examined in an intent-to-treat analysis.
                During the year after random assignment to study groups, multiple-family group treatment was associated with a lower rate of psychiatric hospitalization than standard care. It was only marginally associated with lower use of crisis services, and it was not associated with the amount of outpatient service time.
                The findings suggest that implementation of multiple-family group treatment in a capitated community mental health setting improves hospitalization outcomes without increasing the overall volume of outpatient mental health services.<doc-sep>An exploratory randomised controlled trial of a support programme for carers of patients with a psychosis.<doc-sep>Despite an acknowledgement of the impact of serious mental disorders on informal caregivers, we still know little about how to best help them. The aim of the study was to evaluate the effectiveness of a two-phased carers' intervention comprising family sessions followed by relatives' groups. This intervention was designed to be of 'intermediate' intensity, that is,one lying between brief educational programmes and long-term family psychoeducational treatments.
                An exploratory randomised controlled trial was conducted comparing the experimental support programme with 'standard' care. All carers of patients with a psychotic disorder from a defined population were approached. Outcome measures were based on a 'stress-appraisal-coping' model of caregiving.
                Despite concerted attempts to engage carers, only 42% participated in the study. The carers' programme did not offer any significant advantage on any of the outcome measures: psychological morbidity, negative appraisal, coping or social support. The severity of caregiving difficulties decreased over the study period for the group as a whole.
                There is still uncertainty about the most effective interventions for carers. Meeting 'needs' may not improve caregiver distress.<doc-sep>A randomized controlled trial of a brief intervention for families of patients with a first episode of psychosis.<doc-sep>Carers' satisfaction with psychiatric services related to information and advice is generally poor. This may be particularly true for services trying to meet the needs of ethnically diverse communities. It is important that services attempt to ameliorate carers' concerns as early as possible. The authors aimed to assess the impact of a brief educational and advice support service on carers of patients with a first episode of psychotic illness.
                Carers of all patients identified with a first episode of psychosis in a defined psychiatric catchment area of North London were invited to participate. Following consent from patients and relatives, relatives were randomly allocated to receive (in addition to usual services) a brief intervention comprising education and advice about the disorder from a support team or to usual care from community psychiatric services.
                One hundred and six carers were recruited to the study. Take-up of the intervention was less than expected and the intervention had little impact. The authors found no differences over time between the randomized arms for relatives' satisfaction (F = 23, p = 0 .4, df = 1) or number of days spent by patients in hospital over nine months from entry to the trial (F= 1.7, p= 0.18, df = 1).
                It was found that the support and advice intervention for families had little impact on their satisfaction or on patients' outcomes. However, failure to take up the intervention threatens the conclusions as the power to show an effect was reduced. Although family interventions, in general, are considered an important adjunct to the treatment of patients with chronic psychosis, there may be difficulties in providing an educational and support intervention shortly after first onset. How and when psychiatric services provide information and advice to carers of people newly diagnosed with a psychosis requires further study.<doc-sep>A program for relapse prevention in schizophrenia: a controlled study.<doc-sep>This study examined whether a program for relapse prevention (PRP) is more effective than treatment as usual (TAU) in reducing relapse and rehospitalization rates among outpatients with schizophrenia.
                Eighty-two outpatients with DSM-III-R schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder were randomly assigned to receive either PRP (experimental group, n = 41) or TAU (control group, n = 41) and were followed up for an 18-month prospective controlled study. Patients in both groups were prescribed standard doses of maintenance antipsychotic medication. Treatment with PRP consisted of a combination of psychoeducation, active monitoring for prodromal symptoms with clinical intervention when such symptoms occurred, weekly group therapy for patients, and multifamily groups. The TAU consisted of biweekly individual supportive therapy and medication management.
                Outcome rates over 18 months were 17% for relapse (7 patients) and 22% for rehospitalization (9 patients) in the PRP group, compared with 34% for relapse (14 patients) and 39% for rehospitalization (16 patients) in the TAU group (P = .01 and P = .03, respectively). Addition of age, sex, baseline Global Assessment Scale score, Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale scores (3 measures), and substance abuse to the proportional hazards regression models all yielded nonsignificant effects. The PRP teams were much more likely than the TAU psychiatrists to identify prodromal episodes before patients met objective relapse criteria or needed hospitalization.
                The PRP was effective in detecting prodromal symptoms of relapse early in an episode. Crisis intervention including increased antipsychotic medication use during the prodromal phase reduced relapse and rehospitalization rates.<doc-sep>Patient and relative education in community psychiatry: a randomized controlled trial regarding its effectiveness.<doc-sep>Family psychoeducation has a well-documented effect on the short-term prognosis in schizophrenia. Less is known about the effectiveness of shorter programmes with the main focus on information for patients (patient education) or for patients and relatives (family education).
                A randomized study of the effectiveness of an eight-session psychoeducational programme for patients with schizophrenia and for their relatives was conducted in two community mental health centres, in Arhus and Viborg (Denmark). Patient outcome measures were knowledge, relapse, compliance, insight and satisfaction, and relative outcome measures were knowledge and satisfaction. Post-intervention outcome and follow-up evaluation 1 year after the start of the intervention are presented.
                A statistically significant increase in knowledge of schizophrenia in both relatives and patients was demonstrated at postintervention and a non-significant trend at 1-year follow-up. Statistically significant changes in the Verona Service Satisfaction Scale Scores in the subdimension of satisfaction with Relatives involvement were demonstrated both for patients and relatives postintervention and for patients at 1-year follow-up. There was a tendency that time-to-relapse increased in the intervention group at postintervention and that the schizophrenia subscore of the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale was reduced in the intervention group at 1-year follow-up. No differences were found between the groups regarding compliance, insight into psychosis, psychosocial function (General Assessment of Function) or in relatives' expressed emotion scores postintervention or at 1-year follow-up.
                A short patient and relative education programme seems to be able to influence knowledge and some aspects of satisfaction, but does not seem to be sufficient to influence important variables such as relapse, compliance, psychopathology, insight or psychosocial functioning.<doc-sep>Parental affective style and the treatment of schizophrenia. Predicting course of illness and social functioning.<doc-sep>In a randomized controlled study, the affective style (AS) of parents of schizophrenics in clinic-based individual treatment groups and home-based family treatment groups was compared prior to treatment and again three months after treatment had begun. Affective style is an index reflecting the quality of the family emotional climate, measured from face-to-face discussion. Pretherapy and posttherapy measures of negative AS were significantly predictive of relapse within the nine-month treatment period for patients in individual treatment. In addition, for both treatment groups, a negative AS pattern at the posttherapy reassessment was significantly associated with decreased patient social functioning, reduced ability of the family to absorb the family intervention, and lower capacity of the family to cope with everyday family stresses. The results suggest that AS is an important intrafamilial attribute, with implications for treatment strategy and planning.<doc-sep>Multiple-family groups and psychoeducation in the treatment of schizophrenia.<doc-sep>To compare outcomes in psychoeducational multiple-family group treatment vs psychoeducational single-family treatment.
                A total of 172 acutely psychotic patients, aged 18 to 45 years, with DSM-III-R schizophrenic disorders were randomly assigned to single- or multiple-family psychoeducational treatment at six public hospitals in the state of New York. Psychotic relapse, symptom status, medication compliance, rehospitalization, and employment were assessed independently during 2 years of supervised treatment.
                The multiple-family groups yielded significantly lower 2-year cumulative relapse rates than did the single-family modality (16% vs 27%) and achieved markedly lower rates in patients whose conditions had not remitted at index hospital discharge (13% vs 33%). The relapse hazard ratio between treatments was 1:3. The relapse rate for both modalities was less than half the expected rate (65% to 80% for 2 years) for patients receiving individual treatment and medication. Rehospitalization rates and psychotic symptoms decreased significantly, and medication compliance was high, to an equal degree in both modalities.
                Psychoeducational multiple-family groups were more effective than single-family treatment in extending remission, especially in patients at higher risk for relapse, with a cost-benefit ratio of up to 1:34.<doc-sep>Behavioural family management in schizophrenia. Outcome of a clinic-based intervention.<doc-sep>To test further the highly successful outcomes of a controlled study of in-home behavioural family management (BFM) for schizophrenic patients, a clinic-based version of this intervention was compared with customary care alone for 41 schizophrenic patients in a Veterans Administration (VA) mental health clinic. Monthly Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) ratings, conducted by clinic psychiatrists who were 'blind' to the patients' assignment, revealed that 3 (14%) patients who received behavioural family management as well as customary care, as compared with 11 (55%) patients who received customary care alone, had symptomatic exacerbations during the first year of treatment.<doc-sep>","Family intervention may reduce the number of relapse events and hospitalisations and would therefore be of interest to people with schizophrenia, clinicians and policy makers. However, the treatment effects of these trials may be overestimated due to the poor methodological quality. Further data from trials that describe the methods of randomisation, test the blindness of the study evaluators, and implement the CONSORT guidelines would enable greater confidence in these findings.","There is some evidence that family interventions may reduce the risk of relapse in people with schizophrenia. However, the quality of the evidence is very low. There is a need for well-conducted randomised controlled trials to evaluate the effectiveness of family interventions.",CD000088
6,"A comparison of proximal femoral nail antirotation and dynamic hip screw devices in trochanteric fractures.<doc-sep>This prospective, randomized study compared the functional outcome and complications associated with a proximal femoral nail antirotation (PFNA) device with those of a traditional extramedullary device, the dynamic hip screw (DHS), in patients with trochanteric fracture. A total of 121 patients were randomized to the PFNA group (n = 58) or the DHS group (n = 63). Perioperative information and complications were recorded, and assessments of functional outcome were made. The DHS group required a longer operative time and was associated with greater blood loss than the PFNA group. The re-operation rate was lower in the PFNA group compared with the DHS group, especially in patients with unstable fractures, although there was no statistically significant difference in the overall complication rate between the two groups. There were no significant differences in functional outcome between the PFNA and the DHS groups. In conclusion, the PFNA device is useful in the treatment of trochanteric fractures.<doc-sep>Intertrochanteric fractures of the femur: a randomized prospective comparison of the Gamma nail and the Ambi hip screw.<doc-sep>The Gamma nail has been introduced as an advance over the Ambi hip screw in intertrochanteric femoral fractures. Its efficacy in an Australasian setting has not been documented.
                A prospective randomized study was used to compare the Ambi hip screw and the Gamma nail for the treatment of 69 patients over the age of 50 years with intertrochanteric femoral fractures. The groups were similar with respect to age, sex, prefracture mobility and abode, anaesthetic risk grade, CT measured bone density and fracture pattern.
                Those treated with the Gamma nail had a significantly longer image intensifier screening time (P < 0.05), greater blood loss (P < 0.01) and more operative complications. There was no difference in the length of hospital stay but the level of mobility recovered was significantly better in the Ambi group at 6 months follow up. Urine retention was the most frequent complication but did not correlate with the implant or method of anaesthesia. Two implants cut out, one in each group. Limb shortening was similar in both groups and was not affected by leaving the Gamma nail unlocked distally in unstable fractures. Thirteen patients died from pre-existing medical conditions.
                The Gamma nail proved technically more demanding with higher intra-operative complications and inferior return of mobility.<doc-sep>Prospective randomized controlled trial of an intramedullary nail versus dynamic screw and plate for intertrochanteric fractures of the femur.<doc-sep>To compare the surgical complications and functional outcome of the Gamma nail intramedullary fixation device versus the Richards sliding hip screw and plate device in intertrochanteric femoral fractures.
                A prospective, randomised controlled clinical trial with observer blinding.
                A regional teaching hospital in the United Kingdom.
                All patients admitted from the local population with intertrochanteric fractured femurs were included. There were 400 patients entered into the study and 399 followed-up to one year or death.
                The devices were assigned by randomization to either a short-type Gamma nail (203 patients) or a Richard's-type sliding hip screw and plate (197 patients).
                The main surgical outcome measurements were fixation failure and reoperation. A functional outcome of pain, mobility status, and range of movement were assessed until one year.
                The requirement for revision in the Gamma nail group was twelve (6%); for Richard's group, eight (4%). This was not statistically different (p = 0.29; odds ratio, 1.48 [0.59-3.7]). A subcapital femoral fracture occurred in the Richard's group. Femoral shaft fractures occurred with four in the Gamma nail group (2%) and none in the Richard's group (p = 0.13). Three required revision to another implant. Lag-screw cut-out occurred in eight patients in the gamma nail group (4%) and four in the Richard's group (2%). This was not statistically significant (p = 0.37; odds ratio, 2.29 [0.6-9.0]). The development of other postoperative complications was the same in both groups. There was no difference between the two groups in terms of early or long-term functional status at one year.
                The use of an intramedullary device in the treatment of intertrochanteric femoral fractures is still associated with a higher but nonsignificant risk of postoperative complications. Routine use of the Gamma nail in this type of fracture cannot be recommended over the current standard treatment of dynamic hip screw and plate.<doc-sep>Fixation of intertrochanteric fractures of the femur. A randomised prospective comparison of the gamma nail and the dynamic hip screw.<doc-sep>We have prospectively compared the fixation of 100 intertrochanteric fractures of the proximal femur in elderly patients with random use of either a Dynamic Hip Screw (DHS) or a new intramedullary device, the Gamma nail. We found no difference in operating time, blood loss, wound complications, stay in hospital, place of eventual discharge, or the patients' mobility at final review. There was no difference in failure of proximal fixation: cut-out occurred in three cases with the DHS, and twice with the Gamma nail. However, in four cases fracture of the femur occurred close to the Gamma nail, requiring further major surgery. In the absence of these complications, union was seen by six months in both groups.<doc-sep>Comparison of dynamic hip screw and gamma nail: a prospective, randomized, controlled trial.<doc-sep>We report a prospective, randomized, controlled trial, comparing the results of treatment with a dynamic hip screw (DHS) and a gamma nail in 95 consecutive patients with peri-trochanteric fractures of the femur. The DHS was used in 48 patients, the gamma nail in 47. Clinical and radiological outcomes were similar, but the gamma nail was associated with a higher incidence of complications, in particular fracture of the femur below the implant in eight cases. This is consistent with previous reports, and we do not recommend the gamma nail for the treatment of peri-trochanteric femoral fractures.<doc-sep>A prospective trial comparing the Holland nail with the dynamic hip screw in the treatment of intertrochanteric fractures of the hip.<doc-sep>We compared the outcome of patients treated for an intertrochanteric fracture of the femoral neck with a locked, long intramedullary nail with those treated with a dynamic hip screw (DHS) in a prospective randomised study. Each patient who presented with an extra-capsular hip fracture was randomised to operative stabilisation with either a long intramedullary Holland nail or a DHS. We treated 92 patients with a Holland nail and 98 with a DHS. Pre-operative variables included the Mini Mental test score, patient mobility, fracture pattern and American Society of Anesthesiologists grading. Peri-operative variables were anaesthetic time, operating time, radiation time and blood loss. Post-operative variables were time to mobilising with a frame, wound infection, time to discharge, time to fracture union, and mortality. We found no significant difference in the pre-operative variables. The mean anaesthetic and operation times were shorter in the DHS group than in the Holland nail group (29.7 vs 40.4 minutes, p < 0.001; and 40.3 vs 54 minutes, p < 0.001, respectively). There was an increased mean blood loss within the DHS group versus the Holland nail group (160 ml vs 78 ml, respectively, p < 0.001). The mean time to mobilisation with a frame was shorter in the Holland nail group (DHS 4.3 days, Holland nail 3.6 days, p = 0.012). More patients needed a post-operative blood transfusion in the DHS group (23 vs seven, p = 0.003) and the mean radiation time was shorter in this group (DHS 0.9 minutes vs Holland nail 1.56 minutes, p < 0.001). The screw of the DHS cut out in two patients, one of whom underwent revision to a Holland nail. There were no revisions in the Holland nail group. All fractures in both groups were united when followed up after one year. We conclude that the DHS can be implanted more quickly and with less exposure to radiation than the Holland nail. However, the resultant blood loss and need for transfusion is greater. The Holland nail allows patients to mobilise faster and to a greater extent. We have therefore adopted the Holland nail as our preferred method of treating intertrochanteric fractures of the hip.<doc-sep>[Classic nail versus DHS. A prospective randomised study of fixation of trochanteric femur fractures].<doc-sep>The intramedullary hip screw system Classic-Nail and the Dynamic Hip Screw (DHS) were evaluated in a prospective-randomized clinical trial for operative treatment of trochanteric femur fractures. Hundred and ten geriatric patients (mean age 82 years) were runningly included in the study (56 Classic Nail, 54 DHS). No significant differences between the two study groups were observed with regard to treatment and follow-up data. With the Classic-Nail one complete femur shaft fracture and one incomplete fracture occurred at the tip of the nail intraoperatively and could successfully be fixed with cerclage wires. In the DHS group two patients underwent reoperation for significant loss of reduction early postoperatively. At an average follow-up of 3.7 months all fractures were healed with no difference in functional outcome between the two groups.--Classic Nail and DHS both lead to equally good results in the operative treatment of trochanteric femur fractures.<doc-sep>The trochanteric gamma nail versus the dynamic hip screw: a prospective randomised study. One-year follow-up of 146 intertrochanteric fractures.<doc-sep>In a prospective, randomized trial we compared the trochanteric gamma nail (TGN) and the dynamic hip screw (DHS) in the treatment of 146 intertrochanteric fractures. Follow-up was after four and 12 months. The operation time was significantly shorter in the DHS group. At discharge the need for walking aids was less in the DHS group. There were no differences in intraoperative blood loss, medical complications, mortality or length of hospital stay. Major fracture complications occurred twiceas often in the TGN group compared with the DHS group, however they were not statistically significant. Any potential for the TGN leading to a less invasive procedure and a more rapid postoperative mobilisation could not be demonstrated. Compared with the TGN we prefer the DHS for most intertrochanteric fractures in a setting where the majority of these fractures are treated by younger doctors and not by highly specialized hip/trauma surgeons. The TGN may have advantages in selected intertrochanteric fractures.;<doc-sep>Intramedullary versus extramedullary fixation for the treatment of intertrochanteric hip fractures.<doc-sep>One hundred thirty-one patients (135 fractures) who sustained an intertrochanteric fracture were assigned randomly to treatment with either a sliding hip screw or an intramedullary hip screw and followed up prospectively. In patients with unstable intertrochanteric fractures, the intramedullary device was associated with 23% less surgical time and 44% less blood loss; however, use of the intramedullary hip screw in patients who had a stable fracture pattern required 70% greater fluoroscopic time. Intraoperative complications occurred exclusively in patients in the intramedullary hip screw group. There were no differences in the rates of functional recovery between the two fixation groups.<doc-sep>Treatment of intertrochanteric fracture with the Gamma AP locking nail or by a compression hip screw--a randomised prospective trial.<doc-sep>The Gamma AP (Asia-Pacific) locking nail (GAPN) is a modification of the standard Gamma locking nail made especially for use in Oriental patients. We made a randomised prospective comparison of the compression hip screw (CHS) and the Gamma AP locking nail for the internal fixation of 60 intertrochanteric fractures of the hip in elderly patients by comparing perioperative details and analysing the radiographic and clinical results. The operation time for the GAPN group was shorter than for the CHS group and the intraoperative blood loss was lower. The Gamma AP nail enabled earlier mobilisation. We found no significant difference in the time to union and the length of sliding of the lag screw between the two groups. The decrease in the neck shaft angle in the Gamma nail group was significantly smaller than in the CHS patients. There were no significant mechanical complications, such as fracture of the femoral shaft or failure of fixation in the Gamma nail group. On the basis of our observations we conclude that the Gamma AP locking nail is more efficient than the CHS in the treatment of intertrochanteric fractures in geriatric patients.<doc-sep>Use of an intramedullary hip-screw compared with a compression hip-screw with a plate for intertrochanteric femoral fractures. A prospective, randomized study of one hundred patients.<doc-sep>One hundred elderly patients who had an intertrochanteric femoral fracture were randomized to treatment with a compression hip-screw with a plate (fifty patients) or a new intramedullary device, the intramedullary hip-screw (fifty patients). All patients were followed prospectively for one year or until death. A detailed assessment of the functional status and the plain radiographs of the hip was performed one, three, six, and twelve months postoperatively. The two treatment groups were strictly comparable. The operative time needed to insert the intramedullary hip-screw was significantly greater than that needed to insert the compression hip-screw with the plate (p = 0.02), but use of the intramedullary hip-screw was associated with less estimated intraoperative blood loss (p = 0.011). The prevalence of perioperative complications, such as bronchopneumonia, cardiac failure, and urinary tract infection, was comparable in the two treatment groups. There were one intraoperative fracture of the femoral shaft and two intraoperative fractures of the greater trochanter in the group managed with the intramedullary hip-screw. One patient had pulling-out of the compression hip-screw on the seventh postoperative day. Four patients had a trochanteric wound hematoma, without infection, after insertion of an intramedullary hip-screw. All but one of the fractures healed. The one non-union, which was in a patient who had a compression hip-screw, was treated with a hemiarthroplasty. The mortality rate was similar in the two treatment groups. The patients who had an intramedullary hip-screw had, on the average, significantly better mobility at one (p < 0.0001) and three months (p = 0.0013) postoperatively. This difference was no longer seen at six and twelve months, although the patients who had an intramedullary hip-screw still had significantly better walking ability outside the home at those time-periods (p = 0.05). The compression hip-screw was removed from two patients because of pain in the mid-portion of the thigh, which had begun after consolidation of the fracture. Fourteen patients who had an intramedullary hip-screw had cortical hypertrophy at the level of the tip of the nail at twelve months postoperatively. Cortical hypertrophy was significantly related to the use of two interlocking screws (p = 0.02). Six of these patients also had pain in the mid-portion of the thigh, and the nail had been locked with two screws in five of them. Three of the six patients had the hardware removed because of the pain, and the symptoms resolved. A seventh patient had pain without cortical hypertrophy. The intramedullary hip-screw device was associated with significantly less sliding of the lag-screw and subsequent shortening of the limb in the region of the thigh (p = 0.012 and 0.019, respectively); these differences were more pronounced when the unstable fractures in the two treatment groups were compared (p < 0.001).<doc-sep>Intramedullary nailing versus fixed angle blade plating for subtrochanteric femoral fractures: a prospective randomised controlled trial.<doc-sep>To compare closed intramedullary nailing to open reduction and internal fixation using a fixed angle blade plate for the management of subtrochanteric femoral fractures.
                58 patients were equally randomised to undergo either an intramedullary nailing (IN) or fixed angle blade plating (BP).
                There were no significant differences between the 2 groups with regard to age, time to surgery, operating time, receipt of blood transfusions, duration of hospital stay, or fracture classification. The revision rate was 28% (8/29) in the BP group and none in the IN group; the difference was statistically significant.
                Internal fixation using a fixed angle blade plate for subtrochanteric femoral fractures has higher implant failure and revision rates, compared to closed intramedullary nailing.<doc-sep>Minimally invasive osteosynthesis in stable trochanteric fractures: a comparative study between Gotfried percutaneous compression plate and Gamma 3 intramedullary nail.<doc-sep>Our objective was to compare the results of PCCP (Percutaneous Compression Plate) device and Gamma 3 nail for the treatment of stable trochanteric hip fractures and to demonstrate that PCCP device is a minimally invasive system.
                Prospective, randomized trial. Eighty patients aged 60 and over with stable trochanteric fracture were selected and then randomized using a table of randomized numbers. Length of time of operative procedure, hemoglobin levels at 6 and 48 h after surgery, packed cells units administered, and hospital stay were recorded. In addition, the postoperative complications in the first year after the surgery was collected.
                No differences were found in hospital stay, surgical time, blood loss, functional outcome at 1-year follow-up, neck-shaft angle, fracture collapse, and mortality.
                PCCP and Gamma 3 have not presented significant differences in any measured parameter for treatment of stable trochanteric fractures. Therefore, the PCCP system is shown to be as minimally invasive as the Gamma 3.<doc-sep>A comparison of the long gamma nail with the sliding hip screw for the treatment of AO/OTA 31-A2 fractures of the proximal part of the femur: a prospective randomized trial.<doc-sep>Controversy exists with regard to whether to treat AO/OTA 31-A2 fractures of the proximal part of the femur with an intramedullary device or an extramedullary device. A prospective, randomized, controlled trial was performed to compare the outcome of treatment of these unstable fractures of the proximal part of the femur with either a sliding hip screw or a long gamma nail.
                Two hundred and ten patients presenting with an AO/OTA 31-A2 fracture of the proximal part of the femur were randomized, at the time of admission, to fixation with use of either a long gamma nail or a sliding hip screw. The primary outcome measure was reoperation within the first postoperative year. Secondary measures included mortality, length of hospital stay, transfusion rate, change in mobility and residence, and quality of life as measured with the EuroQol 5D outcome score.
                There was no significant difference between the reoperation rates for the two groups. In total, five patients (three from the long-gamma-nail group and two from the sliding-hip-screw group) underwent revision surgery because of cut-out. Tip-apex distance was found to correlate with the implant cut-out rate. There was no significant difference between the two groups in terms of the EuroQol 5D outcome scores, the mortality rates after correction for the mini-mental score, or any of the secondary outcome measures.
                When compared with the long gamma nail, the sliding hip screw should remain the gold standard for the treatment of AO/OTA 31-A2 fractures of the proximal part of the femur because it is associated with similar outcomes with less expense.<doc-sep>A prospective randomised comparison of the dynamic hip screw and the gamma locking nail.<doc-sep>We made a randomised prospective comparison of the Dynamic Hip Screw and the Gamma locking nail for the internal fixation of 200 petrochanteric femoral fractures in elderly patients. There was less intraoperative blood loss and a lower rate of wound complications in the patients treated by the Gamma nail. They had, however, a high incidence of femoral shaft fracture which we relate in part to implant design. We do not recommend the use of the Gamma nail for these fractures.<doc-sep>Treatment of reverse oblique and transverse intertrochanteric fractures with use of an intramedullary nail or a 95 degrees screw-plate: a prospective, randomized study.<doc-sep>Intertrochanteric fractures are composed of different anatomic patterns that vary in their degree of stability following open reduction and internal fixation. A particularly unstable group is classified as AO/OTA 31-A3, with the fracture pattern described as reverse oblique or transverse. The purpose of this study was to compare the results of intramedullary fixation with those of plate fixation for these intertrochanteric fractures in elderly patients.
                Thirty-nine elderly patients with AO/OTA 31-A3 intertrochanteric fractures of the femur were randomized into two treatment groups and were followed for a minimum of one year. The nineteen patients in Group I were treated with a 95 fixed-angle screw-plate (Dynamic Condylar Screw), and the twenty patients in Group II were treated with an intramedullary nail (Proximal Femoral Nail). The treatment groups were comparable with regard to all demographic and injury variables.
                Patients treated with an intramedullary nail had shorter operative times, fewer blood transfusions, and shorter hospital stays compared with those treated with a 95 screw-plate. Implant failure and/or nonunion was noted in seven of the nineteen patients who had been treated with the 95 screw-plate. Only one of the twenty fractures that had been treated with an intramedullary nail did not heal.
                The results of our study support the use of an intramedullary nail rather than a 95 screw-plate for the fixation of reverse oblique and transverse intertrochanteric fractures in elderly patients.<doc-sep>Gamma nails and dynamic hip screws for peritrochanteric fractures. A randomised prospective study in elderly patients.<doc-sep>The Gamma nail was introduced for the treatment of peritrochanteric fractures with the theoretical advantage of a load-sharing femoral component which could be implanted by a closed procedure. We report a randomised prospective study of 186 fractures treated by either the Gamma nail or a dynamic hip screw. Gamma nails were implanted with significantly shorter screening times, smaller incisions, and less intraoperative bleeding. The Gamma nail group had a shorter convalescence and earlier full weight-bearing, but there was no significant difference in mortality within six months, postoperative mobility, or hip function at review. More intra-operative complications were recorded in the Gamma nail group, mainly due to the mismatching of the femoral component of the nail to the small femurs of Chinese people. Use of a smaller modified nail reduced these complications. We conclude that with careful surgical technique and the modified femoral component, the Gamma nail is an advance in the treatment of peritrochanteric fractures.<doc-sep>A randomised comparison of AMBI, TGN and PFN for treatment of unstable trochanteric fractures.<doc-sep>In this study, we initiated a prospective, randomised, clinical trial comparing the AMBI, TGN and PFN operations used for treatment of unstable fractures, for differences in intra-operative use, consolidation, complications and functional outcome.
                We have compared the pre-, intra- and post-operating variables of AMBI, TGN and PFN operations that were used for treatment of unstable trochanteric fractures, of 120 patients all above 60 years old diagnosed with extracapsular hip fractures classified as AO Type 31-A2 or Type 31-A3.
                According to our results the three methods are comparable in the treatment of unstable trochanteric fractures of patients above 60 years old.
                The AMBI remains the gold standard for the fractures of trochanteric region. TGN has an easier and faster procedure, facilitates early weight bearing and had minor late complications. An improper use of the PFN system was the reason for the most complications and the longer operation time of the device. PFN is also an accepted minimally invasive implant for unstable proximal femoral fractures but future modification of the implant to avoid Z-effect phenomenon, careful surgical technique and selection of the patients should reduce its high complication rate.<doc-sep>[Pertrochanteric fractures: a randomized prospective study comparing dynamic screw plate and intramedullary fixation].<doc-sep>The objective of this study was to compare the dynamic hip screw (Synthes) and intramedullary fixation (Targon PF, Aesculap) for the treatment of pertrochanteric fractures in terms of stability, complications and cost effectiveness.
                This prospective randomized study included 60 patients hospitalized in an emergency setting for pertrochanteric fractures between December 2003 and June 2004. All surgeons in our unit participated in the study. Two fixation systems were used: the Targon proximal femoral nail (Aesculap) and the screw-plate dynamic hip screw (Synthes). We noted: patient status (ASA classification), operative data (type of implant, duration), postoperative data (blood loss, radiographic findings, early complications), and outcome (Harris score, time to walking, mortality). All patients were assessed three months after surgery. The series included 60 patients, 14 men (23%) and 46 women (77%). The Targon PF nail was used for 34 patients and the DHS for 26. In the intramedullary fixation group mean age was 81 years (SD = 12.8, range 23-96); it was 82 years (SD 9.8, range 47-97) in the screw-plate group. The AO classification was: intramedullary fixation 31A1 (n = 11), 31A2 (n = 20), 31A3 (n = 3); screw-plate 31A1 (n = 14), 31A2 (n = 11), 31A3 (n = 1). Thirty-one fractures were stable, 29 unstable. Unstable fractures were treated with the Targon PF nail (n = 18) and the DHS screw-plate (n = 11). Stable fractures were treated with the Targon PF nail (n = 15) and the DHS screw-plate (n = 15).
                Mean operative time was 35 minutes for intramedullary nailing and 42 mintues for screw-plate fixation. Mean blood loss was 410 ml for intramedullary nailing and 325 ml for screw-plate fixation (p = 0.07). Mean hospital stay was the same (11 days) in both groups. At three months, mechanical complications involved migration of the cervical screw outside the femoral head for three Targon PF fixations and for two DHS fixations. Screw migration was favored by fracture instability and presence of osteoporosis. There were two deaths in the intramedullary nailing group and one in the screw-plate group. Time to walking was 20 days on average in the intramedullary nailing group and 25 days in the screw-plate group. The mean Harris hip score was 60 in the intramedullary group and 59 in the screw-plate group.
                Data in the literature report an advantage for intramedullary nailing, particularly a mechanical advantage, for the treatment of pertrochanteric fractures. Our findings show that good results are obtained with the screw-plate fixation using the DHS with less blood loss and at a lower cost.<doc-sep>Prospective randomized comparison between a dynamic hip screw and a mini-invasive static nail in fractures of the trochanteric area: preliminary results.<doc-sep>This study aimed at comparing the results obtained with a sliding screw plate and an experimental device including a small-diameter nail that can be placed with a mini-invasive approach and provides a stable fixation.
                Randomized prospective study.
                University hospital.
                The study included two groups with thirty fractures of the trochanteric area.
                In both groups, the surgical procedure was carried out on patients placed on a traction table in a supine position, under an x-ray amplifier. Sliding screw plates (THS) were set in place according to the usual open technique. Nails were placed through a twenty-millimeter supratrochanteric cutaneous incision. This experimental system comprised a locked intramedullary nail with two nonparallel seven-millimeter cervicocephalic screws.
                The comparison between the two groups was based on the surgical procedure (time, duration of x-ray irradiation, and total blood loss); the initial postoperative period (complications, duration of hospital stay, and the time before returning home); the time before full weight bearing became effective; the functional and social recovery; mortality; and the quality of immediate and final anatomic restitution and healing.
                Operating time (p < 0.001) and blood loss (p < 0.001) were lower in the nail group, and no blood transfusion was required. Postoperative pain (p < 0.01), time necessary to support full weight bearing (p < 0.02), and time before returning home (p < 0.05) were reduced in the nail group. All fractures healed in the same amount of time, with good anatomic results in the nail group, whereas ten impactions beyond ten millimeters occurred in the plate group. No difference was found between the two groups in walking ability and autonomy recovery, but hip function (p < 0.05) was better in the nail group.
                This preliminary clinical study has shown the advantages of this mini-invasive technique. It could not evaluate all the possible disadvantages inherent in the method. These points will be evaluated in a multicenter study justified by these preliminary results.<doc-sep>[The gamma-nail as a resilient alternative to the dynamic hip screw in unstable proximal femoral fractures in the elderly].<doc-sep>In a prospective randomised trial between September 1989 and June 1990 one hundred patients with per- and subtrochanteric fractures were consecutively treated by gamma-nail or DHS. The average age of both groups was about 80 years. The operation time for gamma-nailing was longer than for DHS implantation and also the postoperative blood loss was higher in the gamma-nail group. We found no difference of intraoperative blood loss, of perioperative lethality and in duration of hospital care. 90% of gamma-nail patients and 80% of DHS patients were successfully able to walk four days after operation with full weight bearing on the operated limb. Three patients in the DHS group with unstable fractures got cranial perforation of the cephalic screw mobilisation. Five patients of the gamma-nail group were reoperated, one case because of missed distal locking, one because of cranial perforation of the cephalic screw after varus dislocation of the proximal fragment. One patient suffered intraoperatively a proximal femur shaft fracture which was corrected during operation. In one case a wound hematoma was evacuated, an other patient needed secondary wound closure. Despite technical imperfection of implant and instruments, we conclude that the gamma-nail allows a very high percentage early and full weight bearing immediately after operation. So we consider that in the treatment of unstable pertrochanteric fractures of geriatric patients, the gamma-nail has proven to be more efficient than the DHS.<doc-sep>Intramedullary hip screw versus sliding hip screw for unstable intertrochanteric femoral fractures in the elderly.<doc-sep>We report a randomised, prospective study comparing a standard sliding hip screw and the intramedullary hip screw for the treatment of unstable intertrochanteric fractures in the elderly. One hundred and two patients were randomised on admission to two treatment groups. Fifty-two patients were treated with a compression hip screw (CHS), and fifty had intramedullary fixation with an intramedullary hip screw (IMHS). Patients were followed for 1 year and had a clinical and radiological review at 3, 6 and 12 months. The mean duration of operation and fluoroscopy screening time was significantly greater for insertion of the intramedullary hip screw. There was no difference between the groups with regard to transfusion requirements or time to mobilise after surgery. There were two technical complications in the CHS group and three in the IMHS group. There was no significant difference between the two groups in radiological or functional outcome at 12 months. It remains to be shown whether the theoretical advantages of intramedullary fixation of extracapsular hip fractures bring a significant improvement in eventual outcome.<doc-sep>Functional outcome in treatment of unstable trochanteric and subtrochanteric fractures with the proximal femoral nail and the Medoff sliding plate.<doc-sep>To compare outcome between the proximal femoral nail (PFN) and the Medoff sliding plate (MSP) in patients with unstable trochanteric or subtrochanteric fractures.
                This was a consecutive prospective randomized clinical study. In all, 203 patients admitted to two university hospitals with an unstable trochanteric or a subtrochanteric fracture type were included. Surgery was performed with a short intramedullary nail or a dual-sliding plate device. Follow up visits occurred at 6 weeks, 4 months, and 12 months. Functional outcome was measured by walking ability, rising from a chair, curb test, and additional assessments of abductor strength, pain, living conditions, and complications.
                The ability to walk 15 m at 6 weeks was significantly better in the PFN group compared to the MSP group with an odds ratio 2.2 (P = 0.04, 95% confidence limits 1.03-4.67). No statistical difference in walking ability could be found between trochanteric and subtrochanteric fractures. The major complication rate (8% in the PFN group and 4% in the MSP group) did not differ statistically (P = 0.50) but reoperations were more frequent in the PFN group (9%) compared to the MSP group (1%; P < 0.02).
                There were no major differences in functional outcome or major complications between the treatment groups. Reasons other than the operated fracture seem to be equally important in determining the long-term functional ability of the patients in our study. An advantage with the MSP was the lower reoperation rate.<doc-sep>Systematic effects of surgical treatment of hip fractures: gliding screw-plating vs intramedullary nailing.<doc-sep>Numerous studies have been published regarding the comparison between intramedullary nail and the dynamic hip screw and plate for the fixation of intertrochanteric fractures in elderly patients. In this paper we present a comparative study of these two methods regarding their systemic effects on this group of patients.
                This is a randomized trial of 120 consecutive patients with an intertrochanteric fracture treated with either extramedullary fixation (dynamic hip screw and plate; DHS, Synthes-Stratec, Oberdorf, Switzerland) or intramedullary nail (Gamma nail, Stryker Howmedica, Freiburg, Germany and Endovis BA, Citieffe, Bologna, Italy). The parameters that we assessed pre-operatively, in addition to their demographics, included their mental state (MMSE), their nutritional and immune state and their pulmonary function. Intra-operatively we calculated the amount of radiation exposure, the amount of blood loss and the length of operative time for each procedure. Postoperatively we repeated the calculation of the mental and pulmonary state and the blood loss, during days 1, 3, and 10 and related them to the ease of the patient's mobilization.
                Decreased bleeding and post-operative pain, reduced post-operative morbidity and faster recovery of function were better but not significant in the group of intramedullary fixation (all p>0.05). However, in the same group there were slightly more patients in whom the MMSE was falling, together with their pulmonary function, suggesting that this method probably predisposes to higher chances of pulmonary dysfunction and the possibility of pulmonary embolism.
                We found no significant differences between the two methods of stabilization of these fractures regarding their systemic effects perioperatively. The classic dynamic hip screw can preserve its position as a safe and effective solution for these already vulnerable patients having sustained a trochanteric fracture against the novel intramedullary techniques.

A randomised study comparing post-operative rehabilitation.<doc-sep>We treated 108 patients with a pertrochanteric femoral fracture using either the dynamic hip screw or the proximal femoral nail in this prospective, randomised series. We compared walking ability before fracture, intra-operative variables and return to their residence. Patients treated with the proximal femoral nail (n = 42) had regained their pre-operative walking ability significantly (p = 0.04) more often by the four-month review than those treated with the dynamic hip screw (n = 41). Peri-operative or immediate post-operative measures of outcome did not differ between the groups, with the exception of operation time. The dynamic hip screw allowed a significantly greater compression of the fracture during the four-month follow-up, but consolidation of the fracture was comparable between the two groups. Two major losses of reduction were observed in each group, resulting in a total of four revision operations. Our results suggest that the use of the proximal femoral nail may allow a faster post-operative restoration of walking ability, when compared with the dynamic hip screw.<doc-sep>Pertrochanteric fractures: is there an advantage to an intramedullary nail?: a randomized, prospective study of 206 patients comparing the dynamic hip screw and proximal femoral nail.<doc-sep>To compare the results between a sliding compression hip screw and an intramedullary nail in the treatment of pertrochanteric fractures.

Current standards of surgical fixation for the myriad possible fracture patterns include the compression hip screw (CHS), the 90 degrees/95 degrees blade plate, and locked intramedullary nails. The gamma nail (GN) was designed as a ""hybrid"" of these devices, combining theoretical biomechanical advantages that should allow earlier postoperative weight bearing with surgical technique advantages that should decrease operative morbidity. Because these theoretical advantages were unproven in a clinical setting, we prospectively randomized 75 consecutive patients with peritrochanteric femur fractures into two groups to examine the fixation of these fractures with the GN as compared to the CHS. We found no significant differences in preoperative or intraoperative parameters. Postoperatively, the subtrochanteric fracture group treated with the GN achieved earlier weightbearing status, although this was not statistically significant. 72 patients were available for follow-up at a minimum of 6 months. All fractures had clinically and radiographically healed, and 94% of the patients continued to be ambulatory. Major complications included missed distal locking screws (one patient), cutting out of the lag screw superiorly in the femoral head (two patients), and a femur fracture at the distal end of the GN (one patient). In our series, the GN produced clinical results commensurate with current standards of fixation for peritrochanteric femur fractures. Although the GN allowed earlier independent weightbearing status in patients with subtrochanteric fractures, the procedure was technically more demanding and had a significant learning curve.<doc-sep>Trochanteric gamma nail and compression hip screw for trochanteric fractures: a randomized, prospective, comparative study in 210 elderly patients with a new design of the gamma nail.<doc-sep>To compare the results between a new intramedullary Gamma nail and a compression hip screw in the treatment of trochanteric fractures.

                Two hundred ten consecutive patients older than 65 years with trochanteric femoral fractures.
                Treatment with a compression hip screw or a new design of the Trochanteric Gamma nail (180 mm in length with a mediolateral angle of 4 degrees and available only with a proximal diameter of 17 mm and distal diameter of 11 mm).
                Operative and fluoroscopy times, blood loss, functional outcome, complication rate, and failure of fixation.
                The Trochanteric Gamma nail was used in 104 patients and the compression hip screw in 106. The 2 groups were similar in terms of their preoperative data, with a median follow-up of 13.6 months (range 12-30). The results show no difference in operating time (P = 0.21), but the Trochanteric Gamma nail group had a significantly shorter fluoroscopy time (P = 0.006), and the number of patients transfused and the mean of units of blood transfused were significantly less in the Trochanteric Gamma nail group (P = 0.013, 0.046, respectively). Mortality within 12 months was similar in both groups (P = 0.83). All fractures were radiographically healed at the last visit. There was no difference in intraoperative and postoperative complications or rate of fixation failure between the 2 groups, and no case of secondary shaft fracture of the femur was encountered in this study. In the entire series, there was no difference in the functional outcome (P = 0.74), but the postoperative walking ability was better in those patients with unstable fractures who were treated with the Trochanteric Gamma nail (P = 0.017).
                The new Trochanteric Gamma nail is an effective method for the treatment of trochanteric femoral fractures in elderly patients. The indication for either Trochanteric Gamma nail or compression hip screw is similar in stable fractures, but we recommend the use of the Trochanteric Gamma nail for unstable trochanteric fractures.<doc-sep>The standard Gamma nail or the Medoff sliding plate for unstable trochanteric and subtrochanteric fractures. A randomised, controlled trial.<doc-sep>We studied 217 patients with an unstable trochanteric or subtrochanteric fracture who had been randomly allocated to treatment by either internal fixation with a standard Gamma nail (SGN) or a Medoff sliding plate (MSP, biaxial dynamisation mode). Their mean age was 84 years (65 to 99) and they were reviewed at four and 12 months after surgery. Assessments of outcome included general complications, technical failures, revision surgery, activities of daily living (ADL), hip function (Charnley score) and the health-related quality of life (HRQOL, EQ-5D). The rate of technical failure in patients with unstable trochanteric fractures was 6.5% (6/93) (including intra-operative femoral fractures) in the SGN group and 5.2% (5/96) in the MSP group. In patients with subtrochanteric fractures, there were no failures in the SGN group (n = 16) and two in the MSP group (n = 12). In the SGN group, there were intra-operative femoral fractures in 2.8% (3/109) and no post-operative fractures. There was a reduced need for revision surgery in the SGN group compared with the MSP group (8.3%; 9/108; p = 0.072). The SGN group also showed a lower incidence of severe general complications (p < 0.05) and a trend towards a lower incidence of wound infections (p = 0.05). There were no differences between the groups regarding the outcome of ADL, hip function or the HRQOL. The reduction in the HRQOL (EQ-5D(index) score) was significant in both groups compared with that before the fracture (p < 0.005). Our findings indicate that the SGN showed good results in both trochanteric and subtrochanteric fractures. The limited number of intra-operative femoral fractures did not influence the outcome or the need for revision surgery. Moreover, the SGN group had a reduced number of serious general complications and wound infections compared with the MSP group. The MSP in the biaxial dynamisation mode had a low rate of failure in trochanteric fractures but an unacceptably high rate when used in the biaxial dynamisation mode in subtrochanteric fractures. The negative influence of an unstable trochanteric or subtrochanteric fracture on the quality of life was significant regardless of the surgical method.<doc-sep>[Osteosynthesis of per- and subtrochanteric fractures by blade plate versus gamma nail.

                Gamma nail allows early weight-bearing in all patients, fracture healing is acquired at 4.2 months; an operative diaphyseal fracture needed conversion to a long Gamma nail. We observed a slight cut-out that didn't need reoperation. In the blade plate group, we noticed three femoral head necrosis without major flattening, two non-unions, one plate's breakage and two malunions; fracture healing is acquired at 6.3 months. The two non-unions and the plate's breakage didn't need reoperation because of low functional demand.

In the CEA group, 15 ml of 0.375% bupivacaine and 150 micrograms fentanyl were injected into the epidural space at C7-D1 level. In the GA group, patients were anaesthetized with 0.2 mg.kg-1 flunitrazepam and 5 micrograms.kg-1 fentanyl; intubation was carried out using 0.08 mg.kg-1 vecuronium, and the patients were ventilated with a mixture of nitrous oxide and oxygen (50% of each). Further injections, every 30 min, of 2 micrograms.kg-1 fentanyl were given to the patients in group GA. Blood pressure was monitored continuously, up to 4 h postoperatively, with a radial arterial catheter. Per- or postoperative hypertension was defined as a rise in systolic arterial blood pressure (Pasys) over 180 mmHg for greater than 3 min; this was treated with 20 mg nifedipine intranasally (group CEA) or 100 micrograms fentanyl with 0.5 mg flunitrazepam with or without nifedipine (group GA). Per- or postoperative hypotension was defined as a fall in Pasys below 100 mmHg and or a 30% fall in mean arterial blood pressure for greater than 3 min; this was treated, in both groups, with an intravenous bolus of 3 mg ephedrine. Patients in group CEA experienced more frequent episodes of peroperative hypertension (8/2; p less than 0.02) and postoperative hypotension (5/1) than group GA.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)<doc-sep>Local versus general anaesthesia in carotid surgery. A prospective, randomised study.<doc-sep>A randomised, prospective study was performed to compare local (LA) and general anaesthesia (GA) in carotid surgery with special emphasis on complications and the need for intra-operative shunting. Fifty-six patients were randomised to LA and 55 to GA. Eight patients in the LA group required a GA for various reasons. During the same period 14 patients were not randomised. Seven perioperative neurological deficits occurred (5.6%), four in the LA group, two in the GA group, and one in the non-randomised group (NS). Selective shunting was used, in the Ga group according to stump pressure or in cases with a previous stroke and in the LA group according to the appearance of neurological symptoms. In the GA group 25 patients were shunted and in the LA group five patients (P less than 0.001) needed a shunt. If strict pressure criteria for shunting had been used in the LA patients, ten would have been shunted and three of the patients who developed symptoms during clamping would not have been shunted. During surgery the highest recorded systolic pressure was significantly higher in the LA group (210 mmHg versus 173 mmHg, P less than 0.001). LA for carotid endarterectomy is comparable with general anaesthesia regarding peroperative complications but produces significantly higher blood pressures than general anaesthesia. On the other hand it allows the possibility of neurologic monitoring of the patient and leads to significantly less use of an intra-operative shunt.<doc-sep>Hemodynamic status following regional and general anesthesia for carotid endarterectomy.<doc-sep>We prospectively studied 23 patients undergoing carotid endarterectomy under regional (n = 13) or general (n = 10) anesthesia to determine the hemodynamic basis of increased frequency in the need for postoperative vasopressor support when regional anesthesia was used. Anesthesia and postoperative care were conducted without reference to hemodynamic data from pulmonary artery catheterization. Although mean arterial pressure was similar in the two groups postoperatively, 11 of the 13 patients undergoing regional anesthesia and 3 of the 10 patients undergoing general anesthesia required phenylephrine postoperatively. No patient required therapy postoperatively to reduce a systolic pressure exceeding 160 mm Hg. Mean arterial pressure remained below the preoperative baseline value in both groups (p < 0.05 with general anesthesia; p = 0.06 with regional anesthesia) during follow-up. In the general anesthesia group, systemic vascular resistance declined significantly below baseline (p < 0.05) following the operation, accompanied by a decline in mean arterial pressure (p < 0.05) and a higher cardiac output. Intraoperative fluid requirements were greater during general anesthesia than during regional anesthesia (p < 0.01). Pulmonary artery occlusion pressure was lower postoperatively than at baseline in both groups (p < 0.05). Pulmonary artery occlusion pressure was higher in the general anesthesia group despite the greater use of phenylephrine in the regional anesthesia group.<doc-sep>General anaesthesia versus local anaesthesia for carotid surgery (GALA): a multicentre, randomised controlled trial.<doc-sep>The effect of carotid endarterectomy in lowering the risk of stroke ipsilateral to severe atherosclerotic carotid-artery stenosis is offset by complications during or soon after surgery. We compared surgery under general anaesthesia with that under local anaesthesia because prediction and avoidance of perioperative strokes might be easier under local anaesthesia than under general anaesthesia.
                We undertook a parallel group, multicentre, randomised controlled trial of 3526 patients with symptomatic or asymptomatic carotid stenosis from 95 centres in 24 countries. Participants were randomly assigned to surgery under general (n=1753) or local (n=1773) anaesthesia between June, 1999 and October, 2007. The primary outcome was the proportion of patients with stroke (including retinal infarction), myocardial infarction, or death between randomisation and 30 days after surgery. Analysis was by intention to treat. The trial is registered with Current Control Trials number ISRCTN00525237.
                A primary outcome occurred in 84 (4.8%) patients assigned to surgery under general anaesthesia and 80 (4.5%) of those assigned to surgery under local anaesthesia; three events per 1000 treated were prevented with local anaesthesia (95% CI -11 to 17; risk ratio [RR] 0.94 [95% CI 0.70 to 1.27]). The two groups did not significantly differ for quality of life, length of hospital stay, or the primary outcome in the prespecified subgroups of age, contralateral carotid occlusion, and baseline surgical risk.
                We have not shown a definite difference in outcomes between general and local anaesthesia for carotid surgery. The anaesthetist and surgeon, in consultation with the patient, should decide which anaesthetic technique to use on an individual basis.

Mean middle cerebral artery velocity (MCAV(mean)) was monitored using Transcranial Doppler (TCD) and mean arterial pressure (MAP) assessed by continuous intra-arterial blood pressure transducer.
                pre-op MCAV(mean) and MAP were similar in both groups. Pre-clamp MCAV(mean) was similar in both groups and did not differ from pre-op values. With carotid clamping the MCAV(mean) significantly dropped in both groups. The post-clamp MCAV(mean) was significantly less in the GA group (p < 0.05), and the percentage reduction in MCAV(mean) significantly more for GA procedures (p < 0.05). Pre-clamp MAP was significantly elevated in LA procedures and significantly lowered in GA procedures. Pre-clamp MAP was significant less for GA procedures (p < 0.001). Post clamp MAP did not differ from pre-clamp levels in either group. There was no correlation between MCAV(mean) and MAP. Complication rate, combined death/stroke rates were similar in each group.
                LA CEA is associated with better preservation of the ipsilateral cerebral circulation and increased tolerance of the effects of carotid clamping.

                Twenty post-CEA patients were interviewed. Data were content analysed and recurrent themes used to generate the specific carotid endarterectomy experience questionnaire (CEA-EQ). The CEA-EQ consists of 15 pre-op and 13 postoperative questions. Validity was established by correlation with the FRS Patient Satisfaction with Surgical Services (SSSQ) and State form of the State Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI-S) in 69 patients (35 LA, 34 GA). Subsequently 88 patients randomised to GA CEA and 88 to LA CEA received the CEA-EQ. A local anaesthetic intraoperative experience questionnaire (LA-EQ) was also developed and given to LA patients only.
                Validity was confirmed through significant correlations with the STAI-S (r=0.67, p<0.001) and the SSSQ (r=0.44, p<0.001). In the randomised prospective study response rates were greater than 90%. Overall experience and satisfaction with CEA was high. There was no statistically significant difference in anxiety, satisfaction or overall experience between anaesthetic techniques. LA CEA was associated with a significantly better perception of recovery. The majority of LA patients found the procedure acceptable.
                The CEA-EQ is a valid tool to assess qualitative aspects of CEA patient care. Overall satisfaction and experience with CEA is good and not related to anaesthetic technique. LA CEA is not associated with any increased anxiety, is tolerated by the majority of patients and is associated with a better perception of recovery.<doc-sep>[Comparison of the influence of general and regional anesthesia on basic haemodynamic parameters during carotid endarterectomy].<doc-sep>Carotid endarterectomy (CEA) is a preventive operation to reduce the incidence of embolic and thrombotic cerebral stroke. CEA carries a significant perioeperartive mortality rate from stroke and myocardial infarction, which may even approach 5%. Thus, anesthetic and surgical techniques are constantly under scrutiny to try to reduce this relatively high incidence of morbidity and mortality. Anesthetic technique for CEA is divided to general (GA) and regional (RA) anesthesia, performed by cervical plexus block. The aim this study was to examine changes of basic haemodynamic parameters, which routinely fallows during CEA in condition of GA and RA. After obtaining institutional approval and informed consent, we randomized 50 patients scheduled for CEA (Tab. 1) in two groups (GA and RA). We fallow blood pressure: systolic (BPs), mean (BPm), diastolic (BPd), heart rate (HR), and RPP index at the examined patients. The examination performed in six control times: before induction of anesthesia (T1), 10 minutes after beginning of operation (T2), 5 minutes after cross clamping of arteria carotis (T3), 5 minutes after declamping arteria carotis (T4), 10 minutes (T5) and 2 hours after operation (T6). The results of study shows significant changes of blood pressure (BPs and BPm) and RPP index in T2 time in patinets undergoing GA. The changes occurred under influence of induction agent thiopental. These changes were in homeostatic range. In RA patinets, no haemodynamic changes registrated in control times. Therefore, from haemodynamic aspect RA was superior to GA.<doc-sep>Locoregional versus general anesthesia in carotid surgery: is there an impact on perioperative myocardial ischemia? Results of a prospective monocentric randomized trial.<doc-sep>The incidence of cardiac morbidity and mortality in patients who undergo carotid surgery ranges from 0.7% to 7.1%, but it still represents almost 50% of all perioperative complications. Because no data are available in literature about the impact of the anesthetic technique on such complications, a prospective randomized monocentric study was undertaken to evaluate the role of local anesthesia (LA) and general anesthesia (GA) on cardiac outcome.
                From November 1995 to February 1998, 107 patients were classified by the cardiologist as cardiac patients (IHD; history of myocardial infarction, previous myocardial revascularization procedures, or myocardial ischemia documented by means of positive electrocardiogram [ECG] stress test results) or noncardiac patients (NIHD; no history of chest pain or negative results for an ECG stress test). The patients were operated on after the randomization for the type of anesthesia (general or local). Continuous computerized 12-lead ECG was performed during the operative procedure and 24 hours postoperatively. The end points of the study were ECG modifications (upsloping or downsloping more than 2 mm) of the sinus tachycardia (ST) segment.
                Fifty-five patients were classified as IHD, and 52 were classified as NIHD. Twenty-seven of the 55 IHD patients (49%) and 24 of 52 NIHD patients (46%) were operated on under GA. Thirty-six episodes of myocardial ischemia occurred in 22 patients (20.5%). Episodes were slightly more frequent (58%) and longer in the postoperative period (intraoperative, 10 +/- 5 min; postoperative, 60 +/- 45 min; P <. 001). As expected, the prevalence of myocardial ischemia was higher in the group of cardiac patients than in noncardiac group (15 of 55 patients [27%] vs 7 of 52 patients [13%]; P <.02). By comparing the two anesthetic techniques in the overall population, we found a similar prevalence of patients who had myocardial ischemia (GA, 12 of 52 [23%]; LA, 10 of 55 [18%]; P = not significant) and a similar number of ischemic episodes per patient (GA, 1.5 +/- 0.4; LA, 1.8 +/- 0.6; P = not significant). Episodes of myocardial ischemia were similarly distributed in intraoperative and postoperative periods in both groups. It is relevant that under GA, IHD patients represent most of the population who suffered myocardial ischemia (83%). On the contrary, in the group of patients operated on under LA, the prevalence was equally distributed in the two subpopulations.
                The results confirm the different hemodynamic impact of the two anesthetic techniques. Patients who received LA had a rate of myocardial ischemia that was half that of patients who had GA. The small number of cardiac complications do not permit us to make any definitive conclusion on the impact of the two anesthetic techniques on early cardiac morbidity, but the relationship between perioperative ischemic burden and major cardiac events suggests that LA can be used safely, even in high-risk patients undergoing carotid endarterectomy.<doc-sep>General versus locoregional anesthesia in carotid surgery: a prospective randomised trial.<doc-sep>To evaluate the influence of anesthetic technique on perioperative neurological and cardiopulmonary complication rates in patients undergoing carotid endarterectomy.
                186 patients with symptomatic internal carotid artery (ICA) stenosis > 70% or asymptomatic ICA stenosis > 80% were prospectively randomized for either locoregional (LA) or general anesthesia (GA).
                Neurological complication rates were similar in both groups (GA 2% vs. LA 2%). Cardiopulmonary complication rates were not significantly different (GA 4% vs LA 1%). There were no stroke-related deaths, but one patient from the GA group died from severe postoperative pneumonia. Thus, a significant difference in combined stroke/cardiopulmonary related death between the two groups (GA 1% vs LA 0%) could not be found. However, perioperative cardiopulmonary monitoring showed that significantly more patients operated under general anesthesia had hypertensive events, with systolic blood pressure values greater than 180 mmHg on postoperative day one. There were no differences in the number of postoperatively hypotensive episodes (systolic blood pressure values < 100 mmHg) between the two groups.
                Significant differences in the perioperative neurological and cardiopulmonary complication rates between general and locoregional anesthesia in patients undergoing carotid endarterectomy could not be observed.<doc-sep>","The risk of stroke and death did not differ significantly between the two types of anaesthetic technique during carotid endarterectomy.

It is known that high dose carnitine activates surfactant synthesis. Given to women with imminent premature delivery, its benefit on the post natal period is proved. Own studies showed an increased need of carnitine during pregnancy. Therefore the questions rose if carnitine substitution improves placental insufficiency. 15 pregnant women were treated with 2 x 1 g carnitine orally for one week and with 1 x 1 g carnitine during the following 7 days when their fetus showed a retardation of 1-3 weeks. The control group were 15 untreated patients with the same problems of retardation. The placental insufficiency was diagnosed by fetometry, by blood parameters and the doppler ultrasound flow measurement. In the group of the treated patients 11 out of 15 showed an improvement, in 4 patients no effect of carnitine was seen and in 1 patient the retardation increased. In the control group 8 out of 15 patients showed a spontaneous improvement of fetal growth, 2 women did not have a change in their retardation and 5 patients had to be hospitalized because of increasing placental insufficiency. Inspite of the small number of patients a tendency towards a profit in carnitine treatment for placental insufficiency seems to be real.<doc-sep>[Therapy of suspected intrauterine fetal retardation].<doc-sep>In a randomized prospective study, performed on 45 pregnancies with clinical and sonographic suspicion for intrauterine fetal growth retardation, examinations were done to evaluate the therapeutic effect of bed rest and of additional daily administered glucose infusions or oral galactose applications respectively on the fetal growth, the hemodynamic, respiratory and endocrine insufficiency of the materno-feto-placental unit as well as selected biochemical parameters of the umbilical blood. There is no positive therapeutic effect, either on the impaired endocrine partial function nor on the reduced respiratory function of the feto-placental unit. It is obvious, that despite the improvement of the nutritional supply of the fetus and the revival of the regular fetal growth, the previous lack of fetal growth can not be altered. This can be demonstrated in all three therapeutic groups due to the fact of a resulting high hypotrophy-rate of the newborns. The results prove that the additional supply of the fetus with glucose or galactose does not remarkably improve the therapeutic effectivity as opposed by strict bed rest alone.<doc-sep>[Maternal blood and amniotic fluid insulin-like growth factor detection and amniotic cavity drug delivery for early diagnosis and management of fetal growth restriction].<doc-sep>To explore the relationship between insulin-like growth factors (IGFs) and fetal growth restriction (FGR) and early treatment of FGR.
                The levels of IGF-I and IGF-II were detected with radioimmunoassay in maternal blood and amniotic fluid samples of 44 pregnant women with FGR and 36 normal gravidas. The 44 gravidas with FGR were randomized into treatment group with amino acid by a pediatric administration to the amniotic cavity formula and control group with intravenous infusion of compound amino acid. The therapeutic effects were compared between the two groups on the basis of B-type ultrasound findings.
                Maternal blood IGF-I and amniotic fluid IGF-I and IGF-II levels in the pregnant women with FGR were significantly lower than those in normal gravidas (P<0.01). After therapy, IGF-I and IGF-II levels were significantly increased in the treatment group (P<0.01), but no obvious changes in IGF-I and IGF-II levels were observed in the control group (P>0.05). Compared with the control group, IGF-I and IGF-II levels increased significantly in the amniotic fluid in the treatment group, with also marked elevation of IGF-I levels in maternal blood (P<0.01). Better therapeutic effects were achieved in the treatment group than in the control group (P<0.01), and the birth weights of the neonates in the treatment group were basically normal.
                Detection of amniotic fluid IGF-I and IGF-II and maternal blood IGF-I can help predict the condition and facilitate early diagnosis of FGR. Injection of pediatric amino acid into the amniotic cavity can be effective for treatment of FGR.<doc-sep>",There is not enough evidence to evaluate the use of nutrient therapy for suspected impaired fetal growth.

9,"Antenatal phenobarbital therapy and neonatal outcome. I: Effect on intracranial hemorrhage.<doc-sep>To evaluate the effect of antenatal phenobarbital (PB) therapy on neonatal intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) in preterm infants.
                Prospective, randomized, controlled trial.
                Single institution study.
                Women in preterm labor ( < 35 weeks' gestation) were assigned to control and treatment groups. The treatment group received 10 mg/kg (maximum, 1000 mg) PB intravenously, followed by 100 mg orally daily, until delivery. Neonates did not receive PB after birth. Head sonograms were performed on days 3, 7, and 14 and at discharge. Hemorrhage was classified as mild, moderate, or severe by a single reader.
                Incidence of neonatal ICH in all infants, infants weighing less than 1250 g, and infants of multiple gestations.
                The study population comprised 110 women, 60 in the control group and 50 in the PB group. Neonates in the control group (n = 74, including 10 pairs of twins and 2 sets of triplets) were comparable to those in the treatment group (n = 62, including 7 pairs of twins, 1 set of triplets, and 1 set of quadruplets) regarding birth weight, gestational age, and other clinical risk factors for ICH. There was a trend for the incidence of any grade of hemorrhage to be lower in the PB group (22% [14 of 62]) compared with the control group (35% [26 of 74]). Moderate and severe hemorrhages were significantly lower in the PB group (1.6% [1 of 62]) compared with the control group (9.4% [7 of 74]). Among infants weighing less than 1250 g, overall ICH was lower in the PB group (23% [6 of 26]) compared with the control group (51% [18 of 35]). Among multiple-gestation infants, overall ICH was 4.7% (1 of 21) in the PB group, compared with 31% (8 of 26) in the control group.
                Antenatal PB therapy results in a significant decrease in moderate and severe ICH in infants born at less than 35 weeks' gestation. Antenatal PB therapy also resulted in a decrease in the incidence of all grades of ICH in infants weighing less than 1250 g and infants born of multiple gestations.<doc-sep>Antenatal phenobarbital for the prevention of periventricular and intraventricular hemorrhage: a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, multihospital trial.<doc-sep>To determine whether the neuroprotective properties of phenobarbital would alter the incidence and severity of intracranial hemorrhage in premature infants, we randomly assigned 110 women at less than 31 weeks of gestation to receive 10 mg/kg phenobarbital or placebo in a blinded fashion before delivery. Infants were examined postnatally with real-time ultrasonography for evidence of intracranial hemorrhage. Maternal demographics, pregnancy complications, antenatal management, and route of delivery did not differ between the phenobarbital group (n = 50) and the placebo group (n = 60). The total incidence of periventricular-intraventricular hemorrhage did not differ between the phenobarbital-treated (n = 54) and the placebo-treated (n = 67) infants. However, the frequency of grade 3 and grade 4 hemorrhages was 15% (10 infants) in the placebo group and 3.7% (2 infants) in the phenobarbital group (p less than 0.05). There were no differences in the severity of associated conditions in the babies to explain the difference in the incidence of severe hemorrhage between the study groups. We conclude that antenatal administration of phenobarbital appears to be effective in decreasing the severity of periventricular-intraventricular hemorrhage in infants delivered at less than 31 weeks of gestation.<doc-sep>Use of prenatal phenobarbital in the prevention of subependymal/intraventricular hemorrhage in premature infants.<doc-sep>Subependymal/intraventricular hemorrhage (SE/IVH) is a frequent cause of disability and mortality.
                This is a prospective, randomized, double-blind study which included 100 pregnant Mexican women who need to interrupt their pregnancy within 28-32 weeks of gestation. One group was given a single dose of intravenous (IV) phenobarbital 10 micrograms/kg (phenobarbital group, n = 50), and the other was provided with diluted distilled water (control group). Measurements of phenobarbital serum concentrations were taken by both mother and newborn, and head sonograms were applied during the first 24 hours, at the 3rd and 7th days of life.
                The sample was made up of 42 newborns in the phenobarbital group, and 46 in the control group; the newborns had phenobarbital levels of 11.5 5.7 g/microliter at birth, and of 9.5 +/- 5.9 g/microliter 24 hours later. SE/IVH was found in 12 patients from the phenobarbital group and in 29 from the control group (p < 0.005), the first group were 11 mild SE/IVH (2 grade I, and 9 grade II), and 26 in the control group (4 grade I, and 22 grade II), p < 0.005. Severe hemorrhages were similar between groups. A larger frequency of SE/IVH was found in the newborn group which received mechanical ventilation (p = 0.0008).
                Prenatal phenobarbital can reduce the SE/IVH frequency in premature infants younger than 32 weeks at birth. Its main effect could be shown in patients with mechanical ventilation.<doc-sep>Prevention of intraventricular hemorrhage in very low birth weight infants by maternally administered phenobarbital.<doc-sep>One hundred fifty pregnant women destined to deliver infants less than 32 weeks were randomly assigned to two groups. One group received phenobarbital in doses sufficient to achieve blood levels of 15 to 40 micrograms/mL, and this level was maintained in the neonate after birth. The second group received no antenatal treatment, but the infants were treated with phenobarbital after birth for at least four days. The infants were followed with ultrasound examinations of the head on postnatal days 1, 4, and 10 to assess the grade and progression of intraventricular hemorrhage. Intraventricular hemorrhage was significantly less frequent in the experimental group, 16 of 75 (21%) versus 35 of 75 (47%), P less than .01. Similarly, the experimental group had significantly fewer cases of severe intraventricular hemorrhage (grades III and IV), four of 75 (5%) versus 15 of 75 (20%), P less than .05 and mortality three of 75 (4%) versus ten of 75 (13%), P less than .05.

This report reviews our experience with maternal phenobarbital therapy and fetal bilirubin conjugation in the very premature fetus. Mothers with arrested premature labor between 26 and 33 weeks' gestation were randomly assigned to receive oral phenobarbital (90 mg daily) or not. Infants in the two groups were similar in race, birth weight, and gestational age. Conjugated bilirubin levels at birth were significantly higher for infants receiving several days of phenobarbital in utero than no therapy (0.31 +/- 0.03 vs 0.16 +/- 0.01 mg dl, p less than 0.01). A smaller portion of infants exposed to phenobarbital in utero required phototherapy (10/23, 43% vs 24/29, 83%, p less than 0.01), which was also more likely to be delayed beyond 48 hours after delivery.

                Patients at imminent risk for spontaneous or indicated premature delivery between 24-34 weeks' gestation were randomized to receive either placebo or vitamin K and phenobarbital. All patients received betamethasone and antibiotics and were managed uniformly by a single perinatal group in one hospital. All newborns were managed uniformly in the same facility by a single neonatal group.
                There was a nonsignificant reduction in all grades of intraventricular hemorrhage in the treatment group when compared to the placebo group (48.2 versus 38.3%; P > .05). Frequencies were reduced for severe intraventricular hemorrhage (grades 3 and 4) (6.0 versus 2.5%; P > .05) and mild intraventricular hemorrhage (grades 1 and 2) (42.2 versus 35.8%; P > .05).
                Antepartum phenobarbital and vitamin K effected a nonsignificant reduction in both mild and severe intraventricular hemorrhage.

The time interval between the dose of phenobarbital and delivery was 5.5 +/- 4.8 hours (mean +/- SD). The infants in the control group (n = 23) and those in the phenobarbital-treated group (n = 25) were comparable regarding birth weight, gestational age, and other obstetric and neonatal risk factors associated with intracerebral hemorrhage. The incidence of intracerebral hemorrhage was 56.5% (13 of 23 infants) in the control group and 32% (eight of 25 infants) in the phenobarbital-treated group (p = 0.08). Moderate or severe hemorrhage was diagnosed in six of 13 control infants and in none of the phenobarbital-treated infants (p less than 0.01). The mortality rate was significantly lower in the phenobarbital-treated group (two of 25 infants) than in the control group (eight of 23 infants; p less than 0.05).

10,"Adoption, reach and effectiveness of computer-based, practitioner delivered and combined smoking interventions in general medical practices: a three-arm cluster randomized trial.<doc-sep>Brief advice for smoking patients has not been sufficiently integrated in routine care. Computer-based interventions emerged as a time saving option that might help to exhaust the potential population impact of the general practice setting.
                151 practices were randomly assigned to one of three intervention programs consisting in the delivery of: (1) brief advice by the practitioner; (2) individually tailored computer-generated letters; or (3) a combination of both interventions. We assessed three dimensions of population impact: (1) adoption, i.e., the rate of practices participating in the program; (2) reach, measured as the number of interventions provided within 7 months; (3) effectiveness, measured as smoking abstinence at 12-months follow-up.
                Among the practices, 70% adopted the program with no significant differences across study groups. Treatment was provided to 3086 adult smokers. Negative binomial regression analysis revealed that the number of interventions provided was higher in practices allocated to the tailored letter and combination intervention groups by 215% (p<.01) and 127% (p=.02), respectively, compared to the brief advice intervention group. Among the patients who received the combination of both intervention, the odds of point abstinence from smoking was increased by 65% (p=.02) and 32% (p=.01) compared to the brief advice and tailored letters intervention respectively. Comparing the number of abstinent patients at follow-up revealed that the tailored letter and combination interventions were superior to the brief advice intervention.

Four hundred and twenty-six male and 42 female clients were randomly assigned to an intervention group (I), and 413 males and 76 females were assigned to a control (C) group. The I group was given an approximately 2-minute smoking cessation instruction by physicians, answered a quiz concerning tobacco, chose their own behavioral goals and were handed a leaflet on how to quit smoking. Subjects in both groups responded to a self-administered questionnaire and a 6-month and 12-month follow-up was performed by post card or telephone. The I group received an encouragement card one month after instruction and abstainers of the I group were awarded a telephone card at the 6-month follow-up. The results were as follows: 1) The male I group exhibited 7.3% (6 months), 10.1% (12 months) abstinence rates and the male C group 4.4% (6 months), 5.3% (12 months), respectively. The difference in 12-month abstinence rates was statistically significant. 2) The female I group exhibited abstinence rates of 16.7% (6 months), 23.8% (12 months) and the female C group 14.5% (6 months), 17.1% (12 months), respectively. 3) A multivariate analysis of smoking cessation showed that lower nicotine dependency, strong determination for smoking cessation, and being female were significant factors for abstinence at the 6-month follow-up. At 12 months, the smoking cessation instruction also became a significant factor.

Of these, 101 were assigned to a structured behavioural change programme, 104 to a simple advice programme adapted from previous research, and 106 to a control group. No significant differences were found between groups for demographic and smoking related variables before the study.
                Patients in the simple advice group received a brief statement of advice from the general practitioner as well as three pamphlets; those in the structured intervention group were given strategies which included attitude and behavioural change programmes as well as techniques to aid compliance. The amount of smoking in all groups was assessed by self reports with validation by measurement of salivary cotinine concentrations.

The present study tested three hypotheses: (a) providing 3 to 5 min of behavioral counseling regarding a cessation strategy would be more effective than simply warning the smoker to quit smoking; (b) smokers with abnormal pulmonary function would be more likely to comply with medical advice than would smokers with normal pulmonary function; and (c) that smokers with abnormal pulmonary function who receive behavioral counseling would be the group most likely to achieve prolonged abstinence. Asbestos-exposed smoking men undergoing screening in a mandated program for naval shipyard workers were categorized as having normal or abnormal pulmonary status on the basis of chest X ray and pulmonary function tests (PFT). They were then randomly assigned within PFT categories to receive either a simple warning or 3 to 5 min of behavioral cessation counseling from the physician who gave them the results of their pulmonary tests. Subjects' smoking status was evaluated at 3- and 11-month intervals following the physician intervention. Smokers who received behavioral counseling were more likely to quit and remain abstinent over the 11-month period (8.4% abstinent) than were smokers given a minimal warning (3.6% abstinent). Prolonged abstinence rates among abnormal PFT subjects (3.7%) did not differ from those of normals (5.9%). The group with normal PFT who received behavioral counseling achieved the highest level of abstinence (9.5%).

In addition to routine advice on the health hazards of smoking, half the patients and their families also received further counselling during a home visit by a health visitor. After 6 months many of the 60 patients claimed to have reduced their cigarette consumption. However, the urinary cotinine concentrations did not confirm this. Only one patient actually stopped smoking and he had sustained a myocardial infarction during the study. There was a small but significant reduction of breath CO in the patients seen at home by the health visitor but the urinary cotinine concentrations were unchanged. This suggests that these patients abstained from smoking for only a few hours before attending the 'Stop Smoking' clinic.<doc-sep>Nicotine chewing gum in general practice: effect of follow up appointments.<doc-sep>Two hundred smokers who were judged by their general practitioner to be motivated to stop smoking were allocated to one of two groups. All were offered an initial appointment at which they were advised to stop smoking and offered nicotine gum. One group then received no further appointments. The other was offered four further appointments over three months. Both groups were followed up at six and 12 months. At one year follow up 15.5% overall had stopped smoking, 14% in the low and 17% in the high contact group. This is better than most results so far reported for nicotine chewing gum in general practice, suggesting that general practitioners can use it to good effect. We compare this result with others achieved in general practice.<doc-sep>Smoking cessation at the workplace. Results of a randomised controlled intervention study. Worksite physicians from the AIREL group.<doc-sep>To compare the effects of a worksite intervention by the occupational physician offering simple advice of smoking cessation with a more active strategy of advice including a ""quit date"" and extra support.
                Employees of an electrical and gas company seen at the annual visit by their occupational physicians. CRITERIA END POINTS: Smoking point prevalence defined as the percentage of smokers who were non-smokers at one year. Secondary criteria were the percentage of smokers who stopped smoking for more than six months and the difference in prevalence of smoking in both groups.
                Randomised controlled trial. The unit of randomisation was the work site physician and a random sample of the employees of whom he or she was in charge. The length of the follow up was one year. Each of 30 work site physicians included in the study 100 to 150 employees.
                Among 504 subjects classified as smokers at baseline receiving simple advice (group A) and 591 the more active programme (group B), 68 (13.5%) in group A and 109 (18. 4%) were non-smokers one year later (p=0.03; p=0.01 taking the occupational physician as the statistical unit and using a non-parametric test). Twenty three subjects (4.6%) in group A and 36 (6.1%) in group B (p=0.26) declared abstinence of six months or more. Among non-smokers at baseline, 3.4% in both groups were smokers after one year follow up. The prevalence of smokers did not differ significantly at baseline (32.9% and 32.4%, p=0.75). After the intervention the prevalence of smoking was 30.8% in group A and 28. 7% in group B (p=0.19). An increase of the mean symptoms score for depression in those who quit was observed during this period.
                A simple cessation intervention strategy during a mandatory annual examination, targeting a population of smokers independently of their motivation to stop smoking or their health status, showed a 36% relative increase of the proportion of smokers who quit smoking as compared with what can be achieved through simple advice.<doc-sep>A randomised controlled trial of the effect on middle-aged men of advice to stop smoking.<doc-sep>A randomised controlled trial of smoking cessation is reported in 1445 male smokers aged 40-59 at high risk of cardiorespiratory disease. The 714 men in the intervention group were recalled for a series of personal interviews with a doctor. After one year, 51% of the intervention group reported that they were not smoking any cigarettes, and most of the others reported a reduction. Compared with the ""normal care"" group, the men in the intervention group showed a decline in the prevalence of sputum production and dyspnoea; ventilatory function did not improve but its rate of decline was significantly slowed. There were no evident effects on blood pressure levels, nor on electrocardiographic findings over three years, nor on sickness absence over one year. Mortality follow-up has continued for an average of 7.9 years; 98 (13.7%) of the intervention group have died, compared with 94 (12.9%) of the ""normal care"" group. The 95% confidence limits on mortality range from 2.63% in favour of intervention to 4.37% in favour of normal care. The power of the trial has been reduced by smoking cessation in the ""normal care"" group. It is concluded that smoking cessation in these middle-aged men improved the symptoms and progress of chronic bronchitis; but the reversibility of the risk of cigarettes to the smoker's life may have been overestimated in observational studies.<doc-sep>""Sick of Smoking"": evaluation of a targeted minimal smoking cessation intervention in general practice.<doc-sep>Several smoking intervention studies have been conducted overseas which use a minimal amount of general practitioners' time and are conducted within the constraints of a normal consultation. However, there are no published reports of minimal interventions in Australian general practice. This study reports on 1238 South Australian smokers who were assigned to a non-intervention control group or a group which received firm general practitioner advice to quit smoking plus literature. At one-year follow-up, 7.5% of smokers in the minimal advice group who had quit for six or more months remained non-smokers compared with 3.2% in the control group. If similar analytical procedures had been used in this study as were used in the benchmark study in England in 1979, the quit rate for this study would have been 11.3% in the intervention group, and 4.8% in the control group--a net gain of 6.5%. These results are discussed with regard to widespread implementation in Australian general practice.<doc-sep>Smoking cessation in family practice: the effects of advice and nicotine chewing gum prescription.<doc-sep>The efficacy of physician anti-smoking intervention with 289 patients in a family practice setting was assessed. The design included two treatment conditions, physician advice and physician advice plus the offer of nicotine chewing gum (NCG) prescription. A no-advice group permitted assessment of the effects of repeated testing. The NCG group had higher rates of abstinence at all follow-up points, but the difference approached statistical significance at 3 months only (p less than .10). Comparison of those who actually used NCG to all other groups revealed significantly more users were abstinent at 1- and 3-month follow-up. A similar pattern occurred for proportion attempting cessation and smoking reduction. A dose-response relationship of gum use to outcome was identified. Long-term users (greater than 20 days) had 86% abstinence at 3 months versus 18% for short-term users. Thus, NCG does appear to have a role in family practice for promoting short-term cessation.<doc-sep>Evaluation of a minimal-contact smoking cessation intervention in an outpatient setting.<doc-sep>We examined the ability of a provider-initiated, minimal-contact intervention to modify the smoking behavior of ambulatory clinic patients. Smokers at two outpatient sites were assigned to one of three groups: provider intervention only (PI); provider intervention plus self-help manual (PI/M); and usual care (control) group (C). The physician message emphasized the patient's personal susceptibility, the physician's concern, and the patient's ability to quit (self-efficacy). The nurse consultation concentrated on benefits and barriers associated with stopping, and on strategies for cessation. Telephone interviews were conducted with the 250 participants within a few days of their clinic visit and again at one and six months. Both PI and PI/M proved to be superior to usual care in motivating attempts to quit at both one-month and six-month follow-ups, and logistic regression analyses indicated that participants receiving the self-help manual in addition to the health provider message were between two and three times more likely to quit smoking during the study period than were participants in either of the other study groups.<doc-sep>Proactive interventions for smoking cessation in general medical practice: a quasi-randomized controlled trial to examine the efficacy of computer-tailored letters and physician-delivered brief advice.<doc-sep>To test the efficacy of (i) computer-generated tailored letters and (ii) practitioner-delivered brief advice for smoking cessation against an assessment-only condition; and to compare both interventions directly.
                Quasi-randomized controlled trial.
                A total of 34 randomly selected general practices from a German region (participation rate 87%).
                A total of 1499 consecutive patients aged 18-70 years with daily cigarette smoking (participation rate 80%).
                The tailored letters intervention group received up to three individualized personal letters. Brief advice was delivered during routine consultation by the practitioner after an onsite training session. Both interventions were based on the Transtheoretical Model of behaviour change.
                Self-reported point prevalence and prolonged abstinence at 6-, 12-, 18- and 24-month follow-ups.
                Among participants completing the last follow-up, 6-month prolonged abstinence was 18.3% in the tailored letters intervention group, 14.8% in the brief advice intervention group and 10.5% in the assessment-only control group. Assuming those lost to follow-up to be smokers, the rates were 10.2%, 9.7% and 6.7%, respectively. Analyses including all follow-ups confirmed statistically significant effects of both interventions compared to assessment only. Using complete case analysis, the tailored letters intervention was significantly more effective than brief advice for 24-hour [odds ratio (OR) = 1.4; P = 0.047] but not for 7-day point prevalence abstinence (OR = 1.4; P = 0.068) for prolonged abstinence, or for alternative assumptions about participants lost to follow-up.
                The study demonstrated long-term efficacy of low-cost interventions for smoking cessation in general practice. The interventions are suitable to reach entire populations of general practices and smoking patients. Computer-generated letters are a promising option to overcome barriers to provide smoking cessation counselling routinely.<doc-sep>Smoking cessation in patients: two further studies by the British Thoracic Society. Research Committee of the British Thoracic Society.<doc-sep>The effects of various smoking cessation strategies were studied in two multicentre trials with new patients attending hospital or a chest clinic because of a smoking related disease. In the first trial (study A, 1462 patients) the effect of the physician's usual advice to stop smoking was compared with the effect of the same advice reinforced by a signed agreement to stop smoking by a target date within the next week, two visits by a health visitor in the first six weeks, and a series of letters of encouragement from the physician. The second trial (study B, 1392 patients) compared (1) advice only, (2) advice supplemented by a signed agreement, (3) advice supplemented by a series of letters of encouragement, and (4) advice supplemented by a signed agreement and a series of letters of encouragement. Patients were reviewed at six months and those claiming to have stopped smoking were seen again at 12 months. Claims of abstinence were checked by carboxyhaemoglobin measurement. In study A 9% of the intervention group had succeeded in stopping smoking at six months compared with 7% of the ""advice only"" patients (p = 0.17). In study B success rates were 5.2%, 4.9%, 8.5%, and 8.8% respectively. The signed agreement did not influence outcome, whereas postal encouragement increased the effect of the physician's advice. In both studies patients reviewed clinically between the initial and the six month visit were more likely to stop smoking than those not reviewed. Success rates increased with age and men tended to do better than women. The studies suggest that physician's advice alone will persuade 5% of outpatients with a smoking related disease to stop smoking. Subsequent postal encouragement will increase the cessation rate by more than half as much again. Such small improvements in success rates are worth while, especially if they can be achieved cheaply and on a wide scale.<doc-sep>Brief physician-initiated quit-smoking strategies for clinical oncology settings: a trial coordinated by the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group.<doc-sep>Although tobacco use by cancer patients increases the risk of relapse, diminishes treatment efficacy, and worsens quality of life, about one third of patients who smoked before their diagnosis continue to smoke. Because patients have regular contact with oncologists, the efficacy of a physician-based smoking cessation treatment was evaluated.
                Cancer patients (n = 432) were randomly assigned to either usual care or a National Institutes of Health (NIH) physician-based smoking intervention. The primary outcome was 7-day point prevalence abstinence at 6 and 12 months after study entry.
                At the 6-month follow-up, there was no significant difference in quit rates between the usual care (11.9%) and intervention (14.4%) groups, and there was no significant difference between the usual care (13.6%) and intervention (13.3%) groups at the 12-month follow-up. Patients were more likely to have quit smoking at 6 months if they had head and neck or lung cancer, began smoking after the age of 16, reported at baseline using a cessation self-help guide or treatment in the last 6 months, and showed greater baseline desire to quit. Patients were more likely to have quit smoking at 12 months if they smoked 15 or fewer cigarettes per day, had head and neck or lung cancer, tried a group cessation program, and showed greater baseline desire to quit. Finally, there was greater adherence among physicians to the NIH model for physician smoking treatment for patients in the intervention versus the usual care group.
                While training physicians to provide smoking cessation treatment to cancer patients can enhance physician adherence to clinical practice guidelines, physician smoking cessation interventions fail to yield significant gains in long-term quit rates among cancer patients.<doc-sep>Three year evaluation of a programme by general practitioners to help patients to stop smoking.<doc-sep>A controlled study was undertaken to measure the effectiveness of general practitioners' use of an intensive programme to help patients to stop smoking. Two hundred cigarette smokers who attended a general practice were allocated to either a treatment (n = 100) or a non-intervention control (n = 100) group. After the initial visit treatment consisted of an educational consultation and four follow up visits. Smoking state was assessed biochemically at six months and three years. Thirty five patients in the treatment group were abstinent at three years compared with eight in the control group (p less than 0.001). Sixty four patients attended the educational consultation and first follow up visit; of these, 45 were not smoking at the first follow up visit, 30 maintained abstinence up to six months, and 22 were still not smoking after three years. Among the 37 patients who completed the treatment programme and attended all the follow up visits 57% were abstinent at three years. The results of this study suggest that general practitioners can help patients to stop smoking.<doc-sep>A randomized trial of smoking cessation interventions in general practice in Italy.<doc-sep>The purpose of this study was to examine the effectiveness of different practice-based approaches to assist patients of primary care physicians to quit smoking and sustain cessation. Forty-four nonsmoking general practitioners volunteered for the study. After a period of training, they randomized 923 smoking clients, unselected for motivation toward quitting, to four different intervention groups: (i) minimal intervention, consisting of one single counselling session and a brief handout on quitting techniques; (ii) repeated counselling including reinforcing sessions at Months 1, 3, 6, and 9; (iii) repeated counselling and use of nicotine gum; and (iv) repeated counselling and spirometry. Biochemically validated smoking status was assessed at six and 12 months after recruitment. The proportion of verified quitters at 12 months was 4.8 percent among subjects randomized to the minimal intervention group, compared to 5.5 percent, 7.5 percent, and 6.5 percent among those randomized to the three repeated-counselling groups. In no treatment group was the outcome significantly different from that for one-time counselling at the (P less than 0.05) level. Lack of power, contamination, and low attendance at reinforcing sessions should be taken into account in interpreting the results.<doc-sep>Reaching midlife and older smokers: tailored interventions for routine medical care.<doc-sep>Although older adults can achieve significant health benefits from smoking cessation, few programs have specifically targeted this population. This study tested the effectiveness of an office-based smoking cessation program tailored to midlife and older smokers.
                This paper describes a randomized controlled trial comparing usual care with physician-delivered brief quit-smoking advice and counseling for midlife and older smokers (ages 50-74). Outpatient medical practices assigned to the Immediate Intervention (experimental) condition were trained to deliver brief quit-smoking advice and counseling. Delayed Intervention (control) practices followed usual care procedures. Thirty-nine practices accruing five or more patients per practice were included in the analyses.
                Using conservative measure of quitting, self-reported quit rates at 6-month follow-up were 15.41% for the Immediate Intervention group versus 8.16% of subjects in the Delayed Intervention group (P < 0.005). Baseline subject (N = 659) characteristics related to 6-month abstinence included number of previous quit attempts, quitting for 24 hr in the past year, desire to quit, confidence in quitting, perceived health benefits, and lower nicotine dependence.
                Smoking abstinence was significantly increased by training physicians and key office and clinical staff to intervene with older smokers. Brief interventions are tailored to this age cohort can be successfully and efficaciously integrated into routine care.<doc-sep>Is smoking intervention in general practice more successful among pregnant than non-pregnant women?<doc-sep>The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of a simple smoking intervention programme, carried out by a large number of general practitioners (GPs) among pregnant and non-pregnant women. Four groups of women were defined by the dichotomies pregnant versus non-pregnant and intervention versus control. The intervention was semistructured, using a flip-over and a booklet, and it was implemented in an ordinary sequence of consultations. The study involved 187 GPs in western Norway. The subjects were 350 daily smoking pregnant women and 274 daily smoking non-pregnant women, 18-34 years of age. The point prevalence abstinence rate at 18 months was 15 and 20% for pregnant and non-pregnant women, respectively, in the intervention groups, and 7% in the control groups (Ppregnant = 0.06, Pnon-pregnant = 0.006). Twenty-five per cent of the pregnant women and 34% of the non-pregnant women reported that they had reduced their cigarette consumption, but had not stopped smoking entirely. If we include all drop-outs as smokers, the continuous abstinence rate during 15 months was 6%/0% among pregnant women (intervention/control) and 5%/1% among non-pregnant women. Stopping smoking was associated with having a non-smoking partner (P = 0.001), and being encouraged to do so by their partner (P = 0.004). The prevalence of both pregnant and non-pregnant women who stopped smoking was higher in the intervention than in the control groups. Pregnant women stopped smoking as frequently as non-pregnant individuals.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)<doc-sep>Effects of nicotine chewing gum and follow-up appointments in physician-based smoking cessation.<doc-sep>The effect of different follow-up programs reinforced or not reinforced with the nicotine chewing gum Nicorette was tested by 13 physicians working in the open health care system. A total of 151 patients were advised to stop smoking, and were asked to participate in the program if judged sufficiently motivated by the physicians. After inclusion they were randomized into short or long follow-up, and nicotine gum vs no gum. The physicians conducted the follow-up therapy in their own personal way. Short follow-up was comprised of one appointment 14 days after cessation, while long follow-up consisted of a telephone call (1 week), an appointment (2 weeks), a second appointment (1 month), and a letter (3 months). The results at 12 months were that long follow-up showed a trend (P less than 0.12 toward being better than short follow-up, while nicotine gum was significantly better than no gum (P less than 0.05) in maintaining abstinence. The group with the best outcome was the one receiving long follow-up and nicotine gum, which yielded an expired air carbon monoxide-controlled, 12-month abstinence rate of 27%. The abstinence outcomes at 12 months for the other groups were short follow-up and nicotine gum, 22%; long follow-up and no gum, 15%; and short follow-up and no gum, 3%. The physicians' reactions to the smoking cessation treatment were largely positive. The nicotine gum seems to be a relatively simple, cost-effective, and practical tool for physicians to enhance and reinforce their antismoking advice. With a longer active follow-up period than was used here (1 month), even better results may be possible.<doc-sep>Controlled trial of three different antismoking interventions in general practice.<doc-sep>Of 6052 adult patients who consulted their doctors in six Oxfordshire general practices between October 1980 and February 1981, 2110 (35%) were smokers. The smokers were allocated to one of four study groups--a control (non-intervention) group; a group that received verbal and written antismoking advice from the general practitioner; a group that received this advice and also a demonstration of exhaled carbon monoxide; and a group that received the advice plus the offer of further help from a health visitor. After one year 72% of smokers replied to a postal follow up questionnaire: 11% of the control group claimed to have stopped smoking compared with 15% in the group that received advice alone, 17% in the exhaled carbon monoxide group, and 13% in the health visitor group. Validation of these findings by assays of urinary concentrations of cotinine showed that between 24% and 40% of subjects may have misreported their smoking habits, but there was no indication that the rate of misreporting was higher in the intervention groups than in the control group. Giving advice routinely against smoking has a useful effect, and showing an immediate, personal, and potentially harmful consequence of smoking using a CO-oximeter may improve this, particularly in lower socioeconomic groups.<doc-sep>The impact of physicians' brief smoking cessation counseling: a MIRNET study.<doc-sep>Although many family physicians may discuss smoking cessation with their patients, few do so consistently. A common belief among many physicians is that such efforts will not deter their patients from smoking. Others believe the time commitment required for a successful intervention is excessive. The present study addressed the above issues by examining the effect of a 3- to 5-minute unstructured physician discussion encouraging smoking cessation with family practice patients. Cigarette-smoking patients of two busy family practices in southeast Michigan were randomly assigned to either a control group receiving routine care or an intervention group receiving, in addition to routine care, smoking cessation counseling from their physician. A third comparison group was drawn from smokers in practices not involved in delivering the intervention. Two hundred thirty-eight patients from the intervention group, 178 from the control group, and 47 from the comparison group were followed up with a telephone interview at 6 months. Intervention group patients made significantly more quit attempts than did those in the control group (P less than .001), which was similar to the comparison group. At the 6-month follow-up, 8% of intervention group members, and 4% of both the comparison and control groups reportedly were abstinent from smoking. Among those contacted at the 1-year follow-up, the respective percentages abstinent were 8%, 3%, and 4%. Although these differences in quit rates were not statistically significant, the findings suggest that physicians can positively affect patient smoking cessation. This intervention was feasible in busy family practices, highlighting its generalizability and applicability to other family practice settings in the United States.<doc-sep>Reducing maternal smoking and relapse: long-term evaluation of a pediatric intervention.<doc-sep>Pediatric well-care visits provide a clinical opportunity to counsel new mothers about their smoking and the deleterious effects of environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) on infant health.
                Forty-nine Oregon pediatric offices enrolled 2,901 women who were currently smoking or had quit for pregnancy, using a brief survey at the newborn's first office visit. Randomly assigned offices provided advice and materials to mothers at each well-care visit during the first 6 months postpartum to promote quitting or relapse prevention.
                The intervention reduced smoking (5.9% vs 2.7%) and relapse (55% vs 45%) at 6-month follow-up, but logistic regression analysis at 12 months revealed no significant treatment effect. The intervention had a positive effect on secondary outcome variables, such as readiness to quit and attitude toward and knowledge of ETS. Multiple logistic regression analysis indicated that husband/partner smoking was the strongest predictor of maternal quitting or relapse.
                A pediatric office-based intervention can significantly affect smoking and relapse prevention for mothers of newborns, but the effect decreases with time. Consistent prompting of the provider to give brief advice and materials at well-care visits could provide a low-cost intervention to reduce infant ETS exposure.<doc-sep>A family physician smoking cessation program: an evaluation of the role of follow-up visits.<doc-sep>Our purpose in this randomized clinical trial was to compare a two-visit smoking cessation intervention by family physicians with the same intervention supplemented by additional follow-ups. Forty-one southern Ontario family physicians volunteered for the study and subsequently participated in a four-hour training program on smoking cessation techniques. Physicians advised patients who smoked and indicated an interest in attempting to quit with the help of their physician to stop smoking at the end of a regularly scheduled visit. Physicians instructed patients to make a specific appointment for an evaluation of their smoking habits. Six hundred forty-seven patients returned for that assessment and were than randomized into either the two-visit intervention group (with risk assessment, support, the setting of a cessation date, self-help literature, and a prescription for nicotine gum, where appropriate) or into the other intervention group (with the same maneuvers as well as the offer of four more supportive follow-up visits). We found no statistically significant difference in one-year, biochemically validated, sustained cessation rates between the group offered the long-term follow-up visits (12.5%) and the group given the brief intervention (10.2%). The 95% confidence interval on the difference between the groups was 2.8% in favor of the brief intervention group to 7.3% in favor of the group offered follow-up. The results do not support the value of long-term follow-up visits for smokers.<doc-sep>Facilitating autonomous motivation for smoking cessation.<doc-sep>Physicians used either an autonomy-supportive or a controlling interpersonal style to counsel smokers based on National Cancer Institute guidelines. Physician autonomy support was rated from audiotapes, and patients' perceived competence and autonomous motivation for quitting were self-reported on questionnaires. Validated point prevalences for 6, 12, and 30 months and for continuous cessation were examined. The intervention did not have a direct effect on quit rates; however, structural equation modeling supported the self-determination process model of smoking cessation. The model indicated that the autonomy-supportive intervention was rated as more autonomy supportive, that rated autonomy support predicted autonomous motivation, and that autonomous motivation predicted cessation at all points in time. Perceived competence contributed independent variance to cessation only at 6 months.<doc-sep>Randomized controlled trial of a computer-based, tailored intervention to increase smoking cessation counseling by primary care physicians.<doc-sep>The primary care visit represents an important venue for intervening with a large population of smokers. However, physician adherence to the Smoking Cessation Clinical Guideline (5As) remains low. We evaluated the effectiveness of a computer-tailored intervention designed to increase smoking cessation counseling by primary care physicians.
                Physicians and their patients were randomized to either intervention or control conditions. In addition to brief smoking cessation training, intervention physicians and patients received a one-page report that characterized the patients' smoking habit and history and offered tailored recommendations. Physician performance of the 5As was assessed via patient exit interviews. Quit rates and smoking behaviors were assessed 6 months postintervention via patient phone interviews. Intervention effects were tested in a sample of 70 physicians and 518 of their patients. Results were analyzed via generalized and mixed linear modeling controlling for clustering.
                Intervention physicians exceeded controls on ""Assess"" (OR 5.06; 95% CI 3.22, 7.95), ""Advise"" (OR 2.79; 95% CI 1.70, 4.59), ""Assist-set goals"" (OR 4.31; 95% CI 2.59, 7.16), ""Assist-provide written materials"" (OR 5.14; 95% CI 2.60, 10.14), ""Assist-provide referral"" (OR 6.48; 95% CI 3.11, 13.49), ""Assist-discuss medication"" (OR 4.72;95% CI 2.90, 7.68), and ""Arrange"" (OR 8.14; 95% CI 3.98, 16.68), all p values being < 0.0001. Intervention patients were 1.77 (CI 0.94, 3.34,p = 0.078) times more likely than controls to be abstinent (12 versus 8%), a difference that approached, but did not reach statistical significance, and surpassed controls on number of days quit (18.4 versus 12.2, p < .05) but not on number of quit attempts.
                The use of a brief computer-tailored report improved physicians' implementation of the 5As and had a modest effect on patients' smoking behaviors 6 months postintervention.<doc-sep>The impact of routine advice on smoking cessation from family physicians.<doc-sep>Cigarette smoking continues to be a major health problem. Therefore, physicians have been asked to advise all their patients on the hazards of smoking. A controlled trial was undertaken to measure the impact of family physicians' advice to cigarette smokers during a routine office visit. No significant differences were found in the three measures used to determine outcome--desire to stop smoking, an attempt to stop and success in stopping--between the control and intervention groups. These results are discussed in relation to the health belief model, and suggestions are made on how to increase the impact family physicians could have on smoking cessation to their practices.<doc-sep>Randomized clinical trial of supportive follow-up for cigarette smokers in a family practice.<doc-sep><doc-sep>Smoking prevention among people aged 60 and over: a randomized controlled trial.<doc-sep>This study aimed to test the hypothesis that people aged 60 and older respond to assistance in stopping smoking. Using a single general practitioner visit backed up by a practice nurse, 14% of the smokers had discontinued the habit 6 months after the intervention period. The intervention group also showed some improvements in a standardized measure of breathlessness.<doc-sep>[Effectiveness of the physician's advice to quit smoking: evaluation of the impact a year after the fact].<doc-sep>The results of a physician-based intervention on smoking done by general practitioners in Barcelona (Spain) are described one month and one year after its inception. Among the 208 smokers in the intervention group there were more attempts to quit, and they were more successful than in the 216 smokers in the control group. The proportions of quitters after a year was 5.3% and 2.3% in each group (p less than 0.05). Among the variables related to success in quitting are self-reliance, the willingness to reduce or quit smoking, the intensity of the habit and the family environment.<doc-sep>Effect of nicotine chewing gum as an adjunct to general practitioner's advice against smoking.<doc-sep>This study was designed to see whether the offer and prescription of nicotine chewing gum would enhance the efficacy of general practitioners' advice to stop smoking. A sample of 1938 cigarette smokers who attended the surgeries of 34 general practitioners in six group practices were assigned by week of attendance (in a balanced design) to one of three groups: (a) non-intervention controls, (b) advice plus booklet, and (c) advice plus booklet plus the offer of nicotine gum. Follow up was done after four months and one year. The results show a clear advantage for those offered the nicotine gum (p less than 0.001). After correction for those who refused or failed chemical validation and those who switched from cigarettes to a pipe or cigars, the proportions who were abstinent at four months and still abstinent at one year were 3.9%, 4.1%, and 8.8% in the three groups, respectively. These percentages are based on all cigarette smokers who attended the surgeries including those who did not wish to stop and those in the gum group who did not try the gum (47%). The effect of the offer and prescription of gum was to motivate more smokers to try to stop, to increase the success rate among those who tried, and to reduce the relapse rate of those who stopped. The self selected subgroup of 8% who used more than one box of 105 pieces of gum achieved a success rate of 24%. It would be feasible and effective for general practitioners to include the offer of nicotine gum and brief instructions on its use as part of a minimal intervention routine with all cigarette smokers. A general practitioner who adopts such a routine with similar success could expect to achieve about 35-40 long term ex-smokers a year and so save the lives of about 10 of them. If replicated by all general practitioners throughout the country the yield of ex-smokers would be about one million a year.<doc-sep>Smoking cessation in patients with COPD in daily general practice (SMOCC): six months' results.<doc-sep>Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) forms an increasing health problem. Despite smoking cessation improving the prognosis of the disease, many patients persist smoking. The present study presents the results of a smoking cessation counseling protocol in general practice (Smoking Cessation in patients with COPD in general practice (SMOCC)).
                A randomized controlled trial of patients with COPD compared smoking cessation counseling according to an intensified minimal intervention strategy with usual care. In total 43 general practices with 392 patients participated in Nijmegen, The Netherlands, in 2001-2002.
                Significantly more smokers in the experimental group made a quit attempt (44.9% versus 36.5%) and actually quit smoking than in the control group (16.0% versus 8.8%). The motivation to stop smoking at baseline was not associated with smoking cessation.
                The SMOCC strategy doubled the self-reported quit rates and was complied well by the general practitioners. Implementation in general practice is recommended.<doc-sep>Effectiveness of a minimal contact smoking cessation program for Dutch general practitioners: a randomized controlled trial.<doc-sep>Until recently, Dutch general practitioners contributed little to tobacco control. This is due to several factors, among which is the lack of a feasible intervention program for adult smokers. Such a minimal contact behavioral intervention, using the Stage-of-Change concept, is now available. Effectiveness was tested in a randomized trial.
                Twenty-two general practitioners and their practice assistants were trained in applying the program. In all, 530 smoking patients were enrolled, randomly assigned to either the intervention or the usual treatment condition. Analysis of treatment effects was performed with logistic regression analysis. In a backward stepwise procedure confounding effects of baseline differences were eliminated.
                At 12-month follow-up, self-reported abstinence rates (including nonrespondents as smokers) differed significantly between intervention subjects and controls: 13.4 vs 7.3% point prevalence (odds ratio 1.51, P < 0.05). An analysis of consecutive abstinence, defined as being abstinent at both 6- and 12-month follow-up, showed that 8.2% of the intervention group compared to 3.1% of the controls had sustained abstinence for more than 6 months (odds ratio 3.04, P < 0.001).
                Results indicate that an effective smoking cessation program for use in Dutch general practice, already shown to be feasible, is now available. Outcomes are generally consistent with recent international literature.

The interventions tested were 1) physician counseling, 2) mailed letters and educational materials designed by the National Cancer Institute (NCI), and 3) referral to smoking cessation classes. Thirty-seven family practice physicians at three of Group Health's outpatient facilities participated. Patient participation rates were 95%, and follow-up was complete for 92% of those participating. None of the interventions had any effect on point prevalence of quitting as determined 8-9 months later by self-report. However, the combination of physician counseling and NCI materials doubled the odds of occurrence of significant antismoking behavior (quit, quit and relapse, or cut down) during the ensuing 8-9 months in those individuals receiving that combination. Referral to smoking cessation classes was strikingly ineffective in this setting. Of 369 individuals designated by study design for referral, only 14% even investigated the classes. This compares with a 10% self-referral rate for those persons not designated for referral by our study design. Our results and other recent work suggest that more intensive interventions on multiple occasions based on relapse prevention strategies hold promise for future success in smoking cessation efforts in primary care.<doc-sep>","Simple advice has a small effect on cessation rates. Assuming an unassisted quit rate of 2 to 3%, a brief advice intervention can increase quitting by a further 1 to 3%. Additional components appear to have only a small effect, though there is a small additional benefit of more intensive interventions compared to very brief interventions.",There is insufficient evidence to support the use of pharmacological interventions to promote smoking cessation in the general medical practice setting.,CD000165
11,"Indobufen versus warfarin in the secondary prevention of major vascular events in nonrheumatic atrial fibrillation. SIFA (Studio Italiano Fibrillazione Atriale) Investigators.<doc-sep>The results of a large prospective randomized trial have shown the efficacy of oral anticoagulation in the secondary prevention of major vascular events in patients with nonrheumatic atrial fibrillation (NRAF); less well established is the role of antiplatelet agents. The present study compared the effects of indobufen, a reversible inhibitor of platelet cyclooxygenase, with those of warfarin in this setting.
                A total of 916 patients with NRAF and a recent (< or = 15 days) cerebral ischemic episode were admitted to this multicenter, randomized study, during which they were treated with either indobufen (100 or 200 mg BID) or warfarin (to obtain an international normalized ratio of 2.0 to 3.5) for 12 months. The two groups (462 on indobufen and 454 on warfarin) were well balanced in terms of their main baseline characteristics. The primary outcome of the study was the combined incidence of nonfatal stroke (including intracerebral bleeding), pulmonary or systemic embolism, nonfatal myocardial infarction, and vascular death.
                At the end of follow-up, the incidence of primary outcome events was 10.6% in the indobufen group (95% confidence interval, 7.7% to 13.5%) and 9.0% in the warfarin group (95% confidence interval, 6.3% to 11.8%), with no statistically significant difference between treatments. The frequency of noncerebral major bleeding complications was low: only four cases (0.9%) of gastrointestinal bleeding were observed, all of them in the warfarin group.
                We conclude that, within the limitations of its design, this study may help the medical community in devising appropriate antithrombotic strategies for NRAF patients for whom oral anticoagulants are contraindicated or do not represent a feasible approach to treatment.<doc-sep>",The evidence from two trials suggests that anticoagulant therapy is superior to antiplatelet therapy for the prevention of stroke in people with NRAF and recent non-disabling stroke or TIA.

12,"Abu Dhabi third stage trial: oxytocin versus Syntometrine in the active management of the third stage of labour.<doc-sep>To compare the effect of oxytocin and Syntometrine when used as part of active management of third stage of labour on postpartum haemorrhage, hypertension, nausea/vomiting and retained placenta.
                A randomised double blind trial was conducted in the Obstetric Unit of Corniche Hospital, Abu Dhabi in the United Arab Emirates. Between 1 January 1991 and 30 June 1991, 2040 women were randomly allocated either to the oxytocin (n = 1017) or the Syntometrine (n = 1023) group. Twelve patients had to be excluded from the trial (oxytocin, 5; Syntometrine, 7) after randomisation because they no longer fulfilled the inclusion criteria. All women in the trial received either oxytocin 10 units or Syntometrine 1 ml (oxytocin 5 units+ergometrine (ergonovine) 0.5 mg) by intramuscular injection with delivery of the anterior shoulder of the baby. Relative risk with 95% confidence intervals was calculated for each variable.
                Oxytocin (10 units) alone was as effective as Syntometrine (1 ml) in preventing post-partum haemorrhage without an increase in the incidence of retained placenta. Median blood loss was similar in both groups. The incidences of nausea, vomiting and headache were significantly lower in the oxytocin group, as was the occurrence of a mean rise in diastolic and systolic blood pressures of 20 and 30 mmHg or more, respectively.
                Prophylactic administration of oxytocin 10 U in the third stage of labour, as part of active management, reduces the incidence of maternal nausea, vomiting, headache and rise in blood pressure than does Syntometrine 1 ml without adversely affecting the rate of post partum haemorrhage.<doc-sep>Randomised controlled trial of oxytocin alone versus oxytocin and ergometrine in active management of third stage of labour.<doc-sep>To compare intramuscular oxytocin alone and intramuscular oxytocin with ergometrine (Syntometrine) for their effect in reducing the risk of postpartum haemorrhage when both are used as part of the active management of the third stage of labour.

                3497 women were randomly allocated to receive oxytocin-ergometrine (n = 1730) or oxytocin (n = 1753). Rates of postpartum haemorrhage (> or = 500 ml or > or = 1000 ml) were similar in both arms (odds ratio 0.90 (0.82); 95% confidence interval 0.75 to 1.07 (0.59 to 1.14) at 500 ml (1000 ml) threshold). The use of oxytocin-ergometrine was associated with nausea, vomiting, and increased blood pressure.
                There are few advantages but several disadvantages for the routine use of oxytoxinergometrine when prophylactic active management of the third stage of labour is practised. Further investigation of dose-response for oxytocin may be warranted.<doc-sep>The Salford Third Stage Trial.

                Postpartum blood loss, the length of the 3rd stage of labor, and the need for manual removal of the placenta.
                Four hundred sixty-one women were recruited, 230 allocated to ergometrine plus oxytocin and 231 to oxytocin alone. The duration of the 3rd stage of labor in each group was similar (difference in means 0.2 mins; 95% confidence interval [CI], -1.0 to 1.5) and the need for manual removal of the placenta (odds ratio [OR] 1.21; 95% CI, 0.37 to 4.00). There was less postpartum blood loss in the oxytocin plus ergometrine group, reflected in the lower incidence of primary postpartum hemorrhage (> 500 mL) (OR 0.37; 95% CI, 0.16 to 0.85).
                Judged on the basis of this trial alone, oxytocin plus ergometrine is more effective than oxytocin alone in the prevention of postpartum hemorrhage. However, evidence from other trials shows that the ergometrine component not uncommonly has side effects of nausea, vomiting, and raised blood pressure. The implications for practice therefore depend on the relative weights placed on these competing risks by women and clinicians. Further research is needed to quantify these along with research into possible differential effects on longer-term outcomes and into the implications of a higher dose of oxytocin.<doc-sep>A randomised double blind comparison of Syntometrine and Syntocinon in the management of the third stage of labour.<doc-sep>To compare the effect of intramuscular Syntometrine and Syntocinon in the management of the third stage of labour.

                One thousand consecutive patients with singleton pregnancy and vaginal delivery in February and March 1993.
                The use of Syntometrine in the management of the third stage not only reduced the blood loss after delivery but was associated with a 40% reduction in the risk of postpartum haemorrhage (odds ratio 0.60; 95% CI 0.21-0.88), and the need for repeat oxytocic injections (odds ratio of 0.63; 95% CI 0.44-0.89). The two drugs did not differ in their effect on the duration of the third stage. However, the incidence of manual removal of the placenta was higher when Syntometrine was used (odds ratio 3.7; 95% CI 1.03-12.5), although the overall incidence remained low. Side effects from both drugs, such as nausea, vomiting, headache and hypertension, were uncommon.
                Intramuscular Syntometrine is a better choice than Syntocinon in the management of the third stage of labour.<doc-sep>","The use of ergometrine-oxytocin as part of the routine active management of the third stage of labour appears to be associated with a small but statistically significant reduction in the risk of PPH when compared to oxytocin for blood loss of 500 ml or more. No statistically significant difference was observed between the groups for blood loss of 1000 ml or more. A statistically significant difference was observed in the presence of maternal side-effects, including elevation of diastolic blood pressure, vomiting and nausea, associated with ergometrine-oxytocin use compared to oxytocin use. Thus, the advantage of a reduction in the risk of PPH, between 500 and 1000 ml blood loss, needs to be weighed against the adverse side-effects associated with the use of ergometrine-oxytocin.",Oxytocin alone or in combination with Syntocinon reduces the risk of postpartum haemorrhage without increasing the need for manual removal of the placenta.

13,"A double-blind controlled trial of etretinate (Tigason) and ibuprofen in psoriatic arthritis.<doc-sep>Etretinate (Tigason) and ibuprofen have been compared in a double-blind controlled trial in psoriatic arthritis to see if we could confirm a specific action for this vitamin A derivative suggested from earlier uncontrolled studies. Eleven out of 20 patients completed 24 weeks of therapy with etretinate (up to 0.5 mg/kg/day) whereas only 1/20 patients completed 24 weeks of therapy with ibuprofen alone. Etretinate improved skin lesions, and this may have encouraged patients to persist with it. Improvement of statistical significance was seen for articular index in both groups. In addition significant improvement in ESR, haemoglobin, C-reactive protein, and histidine occurred in the etretinate group. The main side effects of etretinate (which may preclude its use at a higher dose in this condition) included cracked and dried lips and sore mouth.<doc-sep>Therapeutic value of colchicine in the treatment of patients with psoriatic arthritis.<doc-sep>To test the hypothesis that colchicine is an effective treatment of psoriatic arthritis.
                Twenty five patients with psoriatic arthritis were entered into a two centre, double blind, crossover study of 23 weeks' duration comparing the therapeutic effect of colchicine (0.6-1.8 mg/day) with placebo.
                No significant difference was noted between colchicine or placebo treatment for the primary outcome measure (Lansbury joint count) or any of the seven secondary outcome measures. No change in the psoriasis was noted during active or placebo treatment. Adverse clinical effects were reported more often during treatment with colchicine (14 patients) than with the placebo (four patients), resulting in the early withdrawal of three patients receiving colchicine from the trial. Increased creatine kinase values, without weakness, occurred during treatment with colchicine (five patients) and placebo (four patients).
                In conclusion, our study did not provide evidence that colchicine is of therapeutic value in the treatment of psoriatic arthritis.<doc-sep>Sulfasalazine therapy for psoriatic arthritis: a double blind, placebo controlled trial.<doc-sep>Psoriatic arthritis (PsA) is often poorly responsive to 2nd line antirheumatic drug therapy. Sulfasalazine has recently gained wide acceptance in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, and beneficial effects have also been noted in ankylosing spondylitis and reactive arthritis. We report a double blind placebo controlled study of sulfasalazine in PsA.
                Twenty-four patients with active PsA were randomized to receive either sulfasalazine (3 g/day) (n = 10) or placebo (n = 14) for 8 weeks, in a double blind manner, followed by an 8 week open label crossover phase for nonresponding placebo patients.
                Compared with placebo controls, sulfasalazine treated patients were significantly improved at Weeks 4 and 8 with respect to physician (p < 0.01) and patient (p < 0.05) global assessments. Duration of morning stiffness was significantly decreased at Week 8 (p < 0.01). Clinical variables of disease activity returned to baseline after a 4 week drug washout period in 5 evaluable patients. Six patients in the placebo group crossed over to an 8 week open label phase and demonstrated significant improvements in joint scores, 50 ft walking time, and global patient assessment. Sulfasalazine treated patients also showed significant improvements in cutaneous involvement.
                Sulfasalazine was effective in PsA, with efficacy observed as early as the 4th week of treatment. Longterm studies are needed to determine whether such therapy can modify disease outcome.<doc-sep>A multicentre double-blind comparison of auranofin, intramuscular gold thiomalate and placebo in patients with psoriatic arthritis.<doc-sep>The efficacy and safety of the oral gold compound auranofin and intramuscular gold thiomalate have been compared in a placebo-controlled, double-blind, four-centre trial in 82 patients with psoriatic arthritis requiring remittive drug therapy. There were statistically significant falls in Ritchie articular index, visual analogue pain score and ESR at 12 and 24 weeks following i.m. gold but no significant changes in the auranofin group. Intramuscular gold was safe and more effective than auranofin as a second-line, suppressive antirheumatic agent for patients with psoriatic arthritis when followed for 6 months.<doc-sep>Randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled trial of low-dose pulse methotrexate in psoriatic arthritis.<doc-sep>Thirty-seven patients with psoriatic arthritis were entered into a 12-week prospective, controlled, double-blind multicenter trial comparing placebo and oral pulse methotrexate therapy. Methotrexate was given in a dose of 2.5-5.0 mg every 12 hours in 3 consecutive doses per week. A stable background medication program with nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs was allowed. Methotrexate was superior to placebo only in physician assessment of arthritis activity and in improvement of the amount of skin surface area with psoriasis. A small but statistically significant rise of serum total bilirubin occurred in the methotrexate-treated patients. No patients were withdrawn from the study for adverse drug effects.<doc-sep>A double-blind placebo-controlled study of auranofin in patients with psoriatic arthritis.<doc-sep>Two hundred thirty-eight patients with psoriatic arthritis were entered into a 6-month, multicenter, double-blind trial comparing auranofin and placebo. Polyarthritis (greater than 5 tender joints) was present in 90% of the patients, and 94% were seronegative. Auranofin treatment was statistically superior to placebo treatment, according to physician's global assessment and functional scores. A trend in favor of auranofin treatment was seen for each of the other disease parameters studied. Psoriasis worsened in 6 auranofin-treated patients and in 3 placebo-treated patients. The incidence and nature of other side effects were similar to those observed in similar trials of patients with rheumatoid arthritis. Our observations suggest that the use of auranofin in the treatment of psoriatic arthritis is safe, although its therapeutic advantage over treatment with nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs alone is modest.<doc-sep>Fumaric acid therapy for psoriatic arthritis.

                Two hundred twenty-one patients with PsA were recruited from 15 clinics, randomized (double-blind) to SSZ or placebo treatment, and followed up for 36 weeks. Treatment response was based on joint pain/ tenderness and swelling scores and physician and patient global assessments.
                Longitudinal analysis revealed a trend favoring SSZ treatment (P = 0.13). At the end of treatment, response rates were 57.8% for SSZ compared with 44.6% for placebo (P = 0.05). The Westergren erythrocyte sedimentation rate declined more in the PsA patients taking SSZ than in those taking placebo (P < 0.0001). Adverse reactions were fewer than expected and were mainly due to nonspecific gastrointestinal complaints, including dyspepsia, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea.

An earlier open study suggested that it was well tolerated and potentially beneficial. The present double-blind placebo-controlled trial of 30 patients has now confirmed its efficacy. Greater improvement occurred in those patients on active treatment than on placebo, with more benefit being detected in those patients with the symmetrical polyarticular but seronegative pattern of arthritis associated with a high acute-phase response. SASP was stopped in 26% because of side-effects but these were mild. No exacerbation or remission of psoriasis was observed.

A total of 120 patients were included in nine centres. All patients had active disease and fulfilled the criteria of definite psoriatic arthritis of at least 3 months duration. They received either SSZ (2.0 g/day) or placebo. Efficacy variables included pain, patient's overall assessment of joint and skin improvement, morning stiffness, Ritchie articular index, ESR and CRP. An intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis was performed for the 117 patients who qualified (three patients did not qualify due to missing data after baseline). A per-protocol analysis was performed for the 81 patients who completed the 6 months study period (SSZ = 38, placebo = 43). Major reasons for withdrawal were inadequate response (SSZ = 4, placebo = 7) and adverse events (SSZ = 8, placebo = 12). Pain was the only statistically significantly different primary outcome variable at end point in favour of SSZ in the ITT analysis. No significant differences were present in other clinical or biological variables, although there was a trend in favour of SSZ for some variables. SSZ, at a dose of 2.0 g/day, appeared to be a safe treatment in patients with psoriatic arthritis. At this dosage, its efficacy was only demonstrated for the pain variable.<doc-sep>Sulphasalazine in the management of psoriatic arthritis.<doc-sep>There are few 'second-line' drugs available for the treatment of PSA and their use is often limited by toxicity.

Six patients in the SASP group and 11 on placebo discontinued therapy before 24 wk. Evaluation of effect of treatment revealed significant improvements in articular index in both groups at 12 wk. By 24 wk the articular index in placebo group was still showing benefit. In addition to articular index the SASP group improved significantly in terms of visual analogue scale, duration of morning stiffness and ESR. SASP is effective in PSA but the partial clinical response to placebo indicates the importance of placebo-controlled studies in this variable disease.<doc-sep>","Parenteral high dose methotrexate and sulfasalazine are the only two agents with well demonstrated published efficacy in psoriatic arthritis.

14,"Prediction and prevention of delayed ischemic dysfunction after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage and early operation.<doc-sep>Mean hemispheric cerebral blood flow (CBF) was studied after the intravenous administration of xenon-133 in 20 anesthetized patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage. Before early aneurysm operation, repeated CBF measurements were made to evaluate the cerebral vascular reactivity to controlled hyperventilation. Thirteen individuals received intravenous treatment with the calcium channel blocker nimodipine, whereas the other seven patients did not receive such specific antiischemic treatment. Five of the latter patients had an impaired CO2 response, and three showed delayed ischemic deterioration (DID), whereas none of the seven nimodipine-treated patients with impaired CO2 response showed DID. One nimodipine-treated patient with a preserved CO2 response, in whom operation was complicated, developed DID. The observed findings indicate that DID after uncomplicated early aneurysm operation may be associated with an early disturbance of cerebral vasoreactivity. Treatment with nimodipine may counteract the development of DID in patients with an impaired CBF CO2 response.<doc-sep>Magnesium sulfate therapy after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage.<doc-sep>Vasospasm remains a significant source of neurological morbidity and mortality following aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), despite advances in current medical, surgical, and endovascular therapies. Magnesium sulfate therapy has been demonstrated to be both safe and effective in preventing neurological complications in obstetrical patients with eclampsia. Evidence obtained using experimental models of brain injury, cerebral ischemia, and SAH indicate that Mg may also have a role as a neuroprotective agent. The authors hypothesize that MgSO4 therapy is safe, feasible, and has a beneficial effect on vasospasm and, ultimately, on neurological outcome following aneurysmal SAH.
                A prospective randomized single-blind clinical trial of high-dose MgSO4 therapy following aneurysmal SAH (Hunt and Hess Grades II-IV) was performed in 40 patients, who were enrolled within 72 hours following SAH and given intravenous MgSO4 or control solution for 10 days. Serum Mg++ levels were maintained in the 4 to 5.5 mg/dl range throughout the treatment period. Clinical management principles were the same between groups (including early use of surgery or endovascular treatment, followed by aggressive vasospasm prophylaxis and treatment). Daily transcranial Doppler (TCD) ultrasonographic recordings were obtained, and clinical outcomes were measured using the Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS). The patients' GOS scores and the TCD recordings were analyzed using the independent t-test. Forty patients were enrolled in the study: 20 (15 female and five male patients) received treatment and 20 (11 female and nine male patients) comprised a control group. The mean ages of the patients in these groups were 46 and 51, respectively, and the mean clinical Hunt and Hess grades were 2.6 +/- 0.68 in the MgSO4 treatment group and 2.3 +/- 0.73 in the control group (mean +/- standard deviation [SD], p = 0.87). Fisher grades were similar in both groups. Mean middle cerebral artery velocities were 93 +/- 27 cm/second in MgSO4-treated patients and 102 +/- 34 cm/second in the control group (mean +/- SD, p = 0.41). Symptomatic vasospasm, confirmed by angiography, occurred in six of 20 patients receiving MgSO4 and in five of 16 patients receiving placebo. Mean GOS scores were 3.8 +/- 1.6 and 3.6 +/- 1.5 (mean +/- SD, p = 0.74) in the treatment and control groups, respectively. Significant adverse effects from treatment with MgSO4 did not occur.
                Administration of high-dose MgSO4 following aneurysmal SAH is safe, and steady Mg++ levels in the range of 4 to 5.5 mg/dl are easily maintained. This treatment does not interfere with neurological assessment, administration of anesthesia during surgery, or other aspects of clinical care. We observed a trend in which a higher percentage of patients obtained GOS scores of 4 or 5 in the group treated with MgSO4, but the trend did not reach a statistically significant level. A larger study is needed to evaluate this trend further.<doc-sep>Effect of AT877 on cerebral vasospasm after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage. Results of a prospective placebo-controlled double-blind trial.<doc-sep>With the cooperation of 60 neurosurgical centers in Japan, a prospective randomized placebo-controlled double-blind trial of a new calcium antagonist AT877 (hexahydro-1-(5-isoquinolinesulfonyl)-1H-1,4-diazepine hydrochloride, or fasudil hydrochloride) was undertaken to determine the drug's effect on delayed cerebral vasospasm in patients with a ruptured cerebral aneurysm. A total of 276 patients, who underwent surgery within 3 days after subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) of Hunt and Hess Grades I to IV, were entered into the study. Nine patients were excluded because of protocol violation. The remaining 267 patients received either 30 mg AT877 or a placebo (saline) by intravenous injection over 30 minutes, three times a day for 14 days following surgery. Demographic and clinical data were well matched between the two groups. It was found that AT877 reduced angiographically demonstrable vasospasm by 38% (from 61% in the placebo group to 38% in the AT877 group, p = 0.0023), low-density regions on computerized tomography associated with vasospasm by 58% (from 38% to 16%, p = 0.0013), and symptomatic vasospasm by 30% (from 50% to 35%, p = 0.0247). Furthermore, AT877 reduced the number of patients with a poor clinical outcome associated with vasospasm (moderate disability or worse on the Glasgow Outcome Scale at 1 month after SAH) by 54% (from 26% to 12%, p = 0.0152). There were no serious adverse events reported in the AT877 group. This is the first report of a placebo-controlled double-blind trial that has demonstrated a significant reduction in angiographically revealed vasospasm by intravenous drug therapy.<doc-sep>Effect of nimodipine on platelet function in patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage.<doc-sep>We studied platelet function in 41 patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage who were randomized to receive either nimodipine or placebo in a double-blind fashion. Nimodipine was given to 21 patients, intravenously for 7-10 days and then orally until 21 days after the subarachnoid hemorrhage. The other 20 patients received placebo in a similar manner. Nimodipine did not significantly influence platelet aggregability. For the first 1-5 days after the subarachnoid hemorrhage, nimodipine treatment did not have any notable effect on adenosine diphosphate-induced platelet thromboxane B2 release, but a significant (p less than 0.05) inhibitory effect was observed thereafter. During intravenous administration, nimodipine prevented the increase in thromboxane release otherwise observed after subarachnoid hemorrhage. Concomitant with the decrease in thromboxane release, nimodipine increased the platelet count both before and after surgery so that the capacity for thromboxane formation per liter of blood decreased less than expected on the basis of thromboxane release per 10(7) platelets. Our study suggests that nimodipine might diminish the chance of cerebral ischemia by inhibiting platelet thromboxane release.<doc-sep>Controlled study of nimodipine in aneurysm patients treated early after subarachnoid hemorrhage.<doc-sep>We enrolled 75 consecutive patients admitted with subarachnoid hemorrhages in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to determine the effect of early intervention with nimodipine on outcome and cerebral blood flow. The cardioprotective effect of nimodipine was assessed by measuring the electrocardiographic changes over the first 3 days of drug treatment. There was a mild lowering of the mean cerebral blood flow in the nimodipine-treated group over the 21-day period. Analysis of the continuous electrocardiographic traces showed no difference between the nimodipine and placebo groups in the frequency or type of abnormality detected. At 3 months, 4 of the 38 patients receiving nimodipine had died, compared with 10 of the 37 placebo-receiving patients. Of the 50 eligible patients who had a proven cerebral aneurysm, 1 patient (4%) on nimodipine died compared with 6 (24%) receiving placebo (0.01 less than P less than 0.05, chi 2 test; approximate 95% confidence interval for mortality difference, 0.4% to 39.6%). We conclude that nimodipine does not increase the cerebral blood flow or protect the heart after a subarachnoid hemorrhage. There were no side effects from nimodipine. The trend toward improved outcome should be verified in a larger series of patients.<doc-sep>Magnesium sulfate in aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage: a randomized controlled trial.<doc-sep>Magnesium reverses cerebral vasospasm and reduces infarct volume after experimental subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) in rats. We aimed to assess whether magnesium reduces the frequency of delayed cerebral ischemia (DCI) in patients with aneurysmal SAH.
                Patients were randomized within 4 days after SAH. Magnesium sulfate therapy consisted of a continuous intravenous dose of 64 mmol/L per day, to be started within 4 days after SAH and continued until 14 days after occlusion of the aneurysm. The primary outcome DCI (defined as the occurrence of a new hypodense lesion on computed tomography compatible with clinical features of DCI) was analyzed according to the ""on-treatment"" principle. For the secondary outcome measures ""poor outcome"" (Rankin >3) and ""excellent outcome"" (Rankin 0), we used the ""intention-to-treat"" principle.
                A total of 283 patients were randomized. Magnesium treatment reduced the risk of DCI by 34% (hazard ratio, 0.66; 95% CI, 0.38 to 1.14). After 3 months, the risk reduction for poor outcome was 23% (risk ratio, 0.77; 95% CI, 0.54 to 1.09). At that time, 18 patients in the treatment group and 6 in the placebo group had an excellent outcome (risk ratio, 3.4; 95% CI, 1.3 to 8.9).
                This study suggests that magnesium reduces DCI and subsequent poor outcome, but the results are not yet definitive. A next step should be a phase III trial to confirm the beneficial effect of magnesium therapy, with poor outcome as primary outcome.<doc-sep>Prevention of vasospasm in subarachnoid haemorrhage. A controlled study with nimodipine.<doc-sep>A prospective randomized double blind study was conducted in 70 patients suffering from subarachnoid haemorrhage, due to aneurysm rupture, to determine if the use of nimodipine reduces the severity of ischaemic deficits secondary to vasospasm. At the end of the study, two patients had severe deficit or died in the treated group, while 10 had a bad outcome in the placebo group. Angiographic vasospasm was not significantly different in its frequency or its severity between the two groups. However, the association of extensive and diffuse vasospasm was less frequent in the nimodipine group. This study confirms the effectiveness of Nimodipine in reducing the occurrence of neurological deficit due to vasospasm, even if this action is not observed in all cases.<doc-sep>Cerebral arterial spasm--a controlled trial of nimodipine in patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage.<doc-sep>We enrolled 125 neurologically normal patients with intracranial aneurysms in a multi-institution, prospective, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial within 96 hours of their subarachnoid hemorrhage, to determine whether treatment with the calcium blocker nimodipine would prevent or reduce the severity of ischemic neurologic deficits from arterial spasm. A deficit from cerebral arterial spasm that persisted and was severe or caused death by the end of the 21-day treatment period occurred in 8 of 60 patients given placebo and in 1 of 56 given nimodipine (P = 0.03, Fisher's exact test). Analysis of the amount of basal subarachnoid blood on pre-entry CAT scans in patients with deficits from spasm showed that an increase in subarachnoid blood was not associated with a worse neurologic outcome among patients who received nimodipine, unlike the situation in patients given a placebo. There were no side effects from nimodipine. We conclude that nimodipine should be given to patients who are neurologically normal after subarachnoid hemorrhage in order to reduce the occurrence of severe neurologic deficits due to cerebral arterial spasm.<doc-sep>Effect of oral nimodipine on cerebral infarction and outcome after subarachnoid haemorrhage: British aneurysm nimodipine trial.<doc-sep>To determine the efficacy of oral nimodipine in reducing cerebral infarction and poor outcomes (death and severe disability) after subarachnoid haemorrhage.
                Double blind, placebo controlled, randomised trial with three months of follow up and intention to treat analysis. To have an 80% chance with a significance level of 0.05 of detecting a 50% reduction in an incidence of cerebral infarction of 15% a minimum of 540 patients was required.
                Four regional neurosurgical units in the United Kingdom.
                In all 554 patients were recruited between June 1985 and September 1987 out of a population of 1115 patients admitted with subarachnoid haemorrhage proved by the results of lumbar puncture or computed tomography, or both. The main exclusion criterion was admission to the neurosurgical units more than 96 hours after subarachnoid haemorrhage. There were four breaks of code and no exclusions after entry. One patient was withdrawn and in 130 treatment was discontinued early. All patients were followed up for three months and were included in the analysis, except the patient who had been withdrawn.
                Placebo or nimodipine 60 mg was given orally every four hours for 21 days to 276 and 278 patients, respectively. Treatment was started within 96 hours after subarachnoid haemorrhage.
                Incidence of cerebral infarction and ischaemic neurological deficits and outcome three months after entry.
                Demographic and clinical data, including age, sex, history of hypertension and subarachnoid haemorrhage, severity of haemorrhage according to an adaptation of the Glasgow coma scale, number and site of aneurysms on angiography, and initial findings on computed tomography were measured at entry. Deterioration, defined as development of a focal sign or fall of more than one point on the Glasgow coma scale for more than six hours, was investigated by using clinical criteria and by computed tomography, by lumbar puncture, or at necropsy when appropriate. All episodes of deterioration and all patients with a three month outcome other than a good recovery were assessed by a review committee.
                Demographic and clinical data at entry were similar in the two groups. In patients given nimodipine the incidence of cerebral infarction was 22% (61/278) compared with 33% (92/276) in those given placebo, a significant reduction of 34% (95% confidence interval 13 to 50%). Poor outcomes were also significantly reduced by 40% (95% confidence interval 20 to 55%) with nimodipine (20% (55/278) in patients given nimodipine v 33% (91/278) in those given placebo).
                Oral nimodipine 60 mg four hourly is well tolerated and reduces cerebral infarction snd improves outcome after subarachnoid haemorrhage.<doc-sep>","Calcium antagonists reduce the risk of poor outcome and secondary ischaemia after aneurysmal SAH. The results for 'poor outcome' depend largely on a single large trial of oral nimodipine; the evidence for other calcium antagonists is inconclusive. The evidence for nimodipine is not beyond all doubt, but given the potential benefits and modest risks of this treatment, oral nimodipine is currently indicated in patients with aneurysmal SAH. Intravenous administration of calcium antagonists cannot be recommended for routine practice on the basis of the present evidence. Magnesium sulphate is a promising agent but more evidence is needed before definite conclusions can be drawn.",There is insufficient evidence to support the routine use of calcium antagonists in the treatment of people with aneurysmal SAH.,CD000277
15,"National Cooperative Crohn's Disease Study: results of drug treatment.<doc-sep>The response of active and quiescent Crohn's disease to prednisone, sulfasalazine, or azathioprine has been studied in 569 patients in a placebo-controlled, randomized, multicenter cooperative trial. The response of active symptomatic disease to prednisone or sulfasalazine was significantly better than to placebo. Response to azathioprine was better than to placebo, but the difference did not reach conventional levels of statistical significance. Patients with colonic involvement were especially responsive to sulfasalazine, and those with small bowel involvement were especially responsive to prednisone. Patients' drug therapy immediately before entry to the study significantly affected subsequent response. For patients with quiescent disease, none of the drugs was superior to placebo in prophylaxis against flare-up or recurrence. There is less than a 5% risk that a clinically significant prophylactic effect of any of the drug regimens was missed.<doc-sep>European Cooperative Crohn's Disease Study (ECCDS): results of drug treatment.<doc-sep>A multicenter double-blind study of the effectiveness of sulfasalazine and 6-methylprednisolone, alone and in combination, was conducted on 452 patients with Crohn's disease. One hundred sixty patients were previously untreated; 292 patients were previously treated. The Crohn's disease activity index (CDAI) was used to determine whether a patient had active (CDAI greater than or equal to 150, n = 215) or quiescent disease (CDAI less than 150, n = 237). Treatment of active disease consisted of high-dose 6-methylprednisolone, 6-methylprednisolone combined with 3 g of sulfasalazine, 3 g of sulfasalazine alone, or placebo, and lasted 6 wk. Patients in remission received maintenance doses of one of these drug regimens for periods of up to 2 yr. One hundred ninety-two patients completed the 2-yr study period. Results were evaluated using life-table analysis and outcome ranking. These methods showed 6-methylprednisolone to be the most effective drug in overall comparison of all patients (p less than 0.001); in previously treated patients (p less than 0.001); and in subgroups: active disease (p less than 0.001), only small bowel disease (p less than 0.05), and both small bowel and colon disease (p less than 0.05). Combination of 6-methylprednisolone and sulfasalazine was the most effective regimen in previously untreated patients (p less than 0.05) and when disease was localized in the colon (p less than 0.001). Sulfasalazine alone was least effective in overall comparison of all patients (p less than 0.05) and in all strata. Drug treatment was of no significant benefit to patients with quiescent disease. Continuous administration of low doses of 6-methylprednisolone, or the combination regimen, was beneficial in patients who responded initially to treatment of active disease. The addition of sulfasalazine, however, offered no advantage.<doc-sep>Low dose steroids and clinical relapse in Crohn's disease: a controlled trial.<doc-sep>The long-term effect of prednisone in Crohn's disease has been examined in a double-blind controlled trial.

16,"Case management in a heterogeneous congestive heart failure population: a randomized controlled trial.<doc-sep>Both randomized and nonrandomized controlled studies have linked congestive heart failure (CHF) case management (CM) to decreased readmissions and improved outcomes in mostly homogeneous settings. The objective of this randomized controlled trial was to test the effect of CHF CM on the 90-day readmission rate in a more heterogeneous setting.
                A total of 287 patients admitted to the hospital with the primary or secondary diagnosis of CHF, left ventricular dysfunction of less than 40%, or radiologic evidence of pulmonary edema for which they underwent diuresis were randomized. The intervention consisted of 4 major components: early discharge planning, patient and family CHF education, 12 weeks of telephone follow-up, and promotion of optimal CHF medications.
                The 90-day readmission rates were equal for the CM and usual care groups (37%). Total inpatient and outpatient median costs and readmission median cost were reduced 14% and 26%, respectively, for the intervention group. Patients in the CM group were more likely to be taking CHF medication at target doses, but dosages did not increase significantly throughout 12 weeks. Although both groups took their medications as prescribed equally well, the rest of the adherence to treatment plan was significantly better in the CM group. Subgroup analysis of patients who lived locally and saw a cardiologist showed a significant decrease in CHF readmissions for the intervention group (P =.03).
                These results suggest several limitations to the generalizability of the CHF CM-improved outcome link in a heterogeneous setting. One explanation is that the lack of coordinated system supports and varied accessibility to care in an extended, nonnetworked physician setting limits the effectiveness of the CM.<doc-sep>The effect of a clinical pharmacist discharge service on medication discrepancies in patients with heart failure.<doc-sep>Heart failure patients are regularly admitted to hospital and frequently use multiple medication. Besides intentional changes in pharmacotherapy, unintentional changes may occur during hospitalisation. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of a clinical pharmacist discharge service on medication discrepancies and prescription errors in patients with heart failure.
                A general teaching hospital in Tilburg, the Netherlands.
                An open randomized intervention study was performed comparing an intervention group, with a control group receiving regular care by doctors and nurses. The clinical pharmacist discharge service consisted of review of discharge medication, communicating prescribing errors with the cardiologist, giving patients information, preparation of a written overview of the discharge medication and communication to both the community pharmacist and the general practitioner about this medication. Within 6 weeks after discharge all patients were routinely scheduled to visit the outpatient clinic and medication discrepancies were measured.
                The primary endpoint was the frequency of prescription errors in the discharge medication and medication discrepancies after discharge combined.
                Forty-four patients were included in the control group and 41 in the intervention group. Sixty-eight percent of patients in the control group had at least one discrepancy or prescription error against 39% in the intervention group (RR 0.57 (95% CI 0.37-0.88)). The percentage of medications with a discrepancy or prescription error in the control group was 14.6% and in the intervention group it was 6.1% (RR 0.42 (95% CI 0.27-0.66)).
                This clinical pharmacist discharge service significantly reduces the risk of discrepancies and prescription errors in medication of patients with heart failure in the 1st month after discharge.<doc-sep>Comprehensive discharge planning for the hospitalized elderly. A randomized clinical trial.<doc-sep>To study the effects of a comprehensive discharge planning protocol, designed specifically for the elderly and implemented by nurse specialists, on patient and caregiver outcomes and cost of care.
                Randomized clinical trial.
                Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania.
                276 patients and 125 caregivers. Patients were 70 years and older and were placed in selected medical and surgical cardiac diagnostic-related groups.
                Group differences in patient outcomes (length of initial hospital stay, length of time between initial hospital discharge and readmission, and rehospitalization rates) and charges for care (charges for initial hospitalization, rehospitalizations, health services after discharge, and nurse specialist services) were measured 2, 6, and 12 weeks after discharge.
                From the initial hospital discharge to 6 weeks after discharge, patients in the medical intervention group had fewer readmissions, fewer total days rehospitalized, lower readmission charges, and lower charges for health care services after discharge. No differences in these outcomes were found between the surgical intervention and control groups during this period.
                Study findings support the need for comprehensive discharge planning designed for the elderly and implemented by nurse specialists to improve their outcomes after hospital discharge and to achieve cost savings. The findings also suggest that this intervention had its greatest effect in delaying or preventing rehospitalization of patients in the medical intervention group during the first 6 weeks after discharge.<doc-sep>A new multimodal geriatric discharge-planning intervention to prevent emergency visits and rehospitalizations of older adults: the optimization of medication in AGEd multicenter randomized controlled trial.<doc-sep>To determine whether a new multimodal comprehensive discharge-planning intervention would reduce emergency rehospitalizations or emergency department (ED) visits for very old inpatients.
                Six-month prospective, randomized (Zelen design), parallel-group, open-label trial.
                Six acute geriatric units (AGUs) in Paris and its surroundings.
                Six hundred sixty-five consecutive inpatients aged 70 and older (intervention group (IG) n = 317; control group (CG) n = 348).
                Intervention-dedicated geriatricians different from those in the study centers implemented the intervention, which targeted three risk factors for preventable readmissions and consisted of three components: comprehensive chronic medication review, education on self-management of disease, and detailed transition-of-care communication with outpatient health professionals.
                Emergency hospitalization or ED visit 3 and 6 months after discharge, as assessed by telephone calls to the participant, the caregiver, and the general practitioner and confirmed with the hospital administrative database.
                Twenty-three percent of IG participants were readmitted to hospital or had an ED visit 3 months after discharge, compared with 30.5% of CG participants (P = .03); at 6 months, the proportions were 35.3% and 40.8%, respectively (P = .15). Event-free survival was significantly higher in the IG at 3 months (hazard ratio (HR) = 0.72, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.53-0.97, P = .03) but not at 6 months (HR = 0.81, 95% CI = 0.64-1.04, P = .10).
                This intervention was effective in reducing rehospitalizations and ED visits for very elderly participants 3 but not 6 months after their discharge from the AGU. Future research should investigate the effect of this intervention of transitional care in a larger population and in usual acute and subacute geriatric care.

                randomized controlled trial.
                we randomized patients aged 75 years and older on four or more medicines who had been discharged from three acute general and one long-stay hospital to a pharmacy intervention or usual care.
                the hospital pharmacist developed discharge plans which gave details of medication and support required by the patient. A copy was given to the patient and to all relevant professionals and carers. This was followed by a domiciliary assessment by a community pharmacist. In the control group, patients were discharged from hospital following standard procedures that included a discharge letter to the general practitioner listing current medications.
                the primary outcome was re-admission to hospital within 6 months. Secondary outcomes included the number of deaths, attendance at hospital outpatient clinics and general practice and proportion of days in hospital over the follow-up period, together with patients' general well-being, satisfaction with the service and knowledge of and adherence to prescribed medication.
                we recruited 362 patients, of whom 181 were randomized to each group. We collected hospital and general practice data on at least 91 and 72% of patients respectively at each follow-up point and interviewed between 43 and 90% of the study subjects. There were no significant differences between the groups in the proportion of patients re-admitted to hospital between baseline and 3 months or 3 and 6 months. There were no significant differences in any of the secondary outcomes.
                we found no evidence to suggest that the co-ordinated hospital and community pharmacy care discharge plans in elderly patients in this study influence outcomes.<doc-sep>To evaluate the effectiveness of a discharge-planning programme for hip fracture patients.<doc-sep>This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of a comprehensive discharge-planning service for hip fracture patients, including length of stay, functional status, self-care knowledge and quality of life (QOL).
                Hip fractures are the most devastating result of osteoporosis. Care of these patients from the moment they enter the hospital until discharge and postdischarge is a challenging task, requiring a coordinated approach by an interdisciplinary team.
                An experimental design was used. Methods. Fifty hip fracture patients were recruited from a medical centre in Taipei, Taiwan and randomly divided into two groups. The control group received routine discharge nursing care and the experimental group received comprehensive discharge planning. After patient admission, researchers assessed discharge-planning needs, provided discharge nursing instruction, coordinated services and determined discharge placement based on assessment results.
                (i) Mean age of 50 hip fracture patients was 78.75 (SD 6.99) years. Mean length of stay was 6.04 (SD 2.41) days for the experimental group and 6.29 (SD 2.17) for the control group. Difference between groups was not significant (t = -0.394, p = 0.696). (ii) The self-care knowledge of the experimental group was higher than that of the control group (F = 11.569, p = 0.001). (iii) Significant improvements were observed in functional status of both groups at three months postdischarge, with no significant differences observed between groups. However, the functional status of experimental group patients showed a slightly better trend than that of the control group. (iv) At three months postdischarge, QOL of experimental group patients was better than control group patients.
                A comprehensive discharge-planning service can improve hip fracture patients' self-care knowledge and QOL. Relevance TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: Results of this study can be used clinically as a basis for practical implementation of discharge-planning services in fracture patients.<doc-sep>Benefits of home visits for falls and autonomy in the elderly: a randomized trial study.<doc-sep>To investigate whether home visits by a occupational therapist reduces the risk of falling and improves the autonomy of older patients hospitalized for falling.
                In this randomized, controlled trial set in a geriatric hospital, 60 patients (mean age, 83.5 yr) who were hospitalized for falling were recruited from the acute medicine department. A home visit from an occupational therapist and an ergotherapist assessed patients' homes for environmental hazards and recommended modifications. The outcomes measured were falls, autonomy, hospitalization for falling, institutionalization, and death.
                During the follow-up period, the rate of falls, hospitalization for falls, institutionalization, and death were not significantly different between the two groups. Both groups had a loss of dependence at 12 mo. This loss of dependence was significant in the control group but not in the intervention group.
                Home visits from occupational therapists during hospitalization of older patients at risk for falling can help to preserve the patient's autonomy.<doc-sep>Effects of a multidisciplinary, post-discharge continuance of care intervention on quality of life, discharge satisfaction, and hospital length of stay: a randomized controlled trial.<doc-sep>To determine the impact of a hospital-coordinated discharge care plan, involving a multidisciplinary team of primary health care providers, on hospital length of stay, quality of life, and both patient and general practitioner inclusion in, and satisfaction with, discharge procedures.
                This investigation comprised a prospective, randomized, controlled, clinical trial.
                This multicentre and cross-jurisdictional study focused on areas of tertiary and primary health care as well as community allied health in Western Australia.
                Patients (n = 189) with chronic cardiorespiratory diagnoses were recruited from respiratory, cardiovascular, and general medical wards at two tertiary hospitals.
                Subjects were randomly assigned to one of two groups. Intervention group patients received a discharge care plan in accordance with that outlined in the Australian Enhanced Primary Care Package, completed before discharge and sent to the patient's general practitioner and other community service providers for review. Control patients were discharged under existing hospital processes. Outcome measures. Patients and general practitioners were surveyed pre-discharge and 7 days post-discharge for quality of life and opinion of discharge procedures. Hospital length of stay was also determined.
                Significant improvements in discharge planning involvement, health service access, confidence with discharge procedures, and opinion of discharge based on previous experience were seen for patients who received the discharge care plan. Further, improved perceptions of mental quality of life were observed within the first week post-discharge for intervention patients. Length of stay showed no difference between groups. Extent and speed of hospital-general practitioner communication were significantly improved via the intervention.
                Our results indicate that a multidisciplinary discharge care plan, initiated before separation, improves quality of life, involvement, and satisfaction with discharge care, and hospital-general practitioner integration. As such, it possesses benefits over current Western Australian hospital discharge procedures for the care of chronically ill populations.<doc-sep>A reengineered hospital discharge program to decrease rehospitalization: a randomized trial.<doc-sep>Emergency department visits and rehospitalization are common after hospital discharge.

                General medical service at an urban, academic, safety-net hospital.
                749 English-speaking hospitalized adults (mean age, 49.9 years).
                A nurse discharge advocate worked with patients during their hospital stay to arrange follow-up appointments, confirm medication reconciliation, and conduct patient education with an individualized instruction booklet that was sent to their primary care provider. A clinical pharmacist called patients 2 to 4 days after discharge to reinforce the discharge plan and review medications. Participants and providers were not blinded to treatment assignment.
                Primary outcomes were emergency department visits and hospitalizations within 30 days of discharge. Secondary outcomes were self-reported preparedness for discharge and frequency of primary care providers' follow-up within 30 days of discharge. Research staff doing follow-up were blinded to study group assignment.
                Participants in the intervention group (n = 370) had a lower rate of hospital utilization than those receiving usual care (n = 368) (0.314 vs. 0.451 visit per person per month; incidence rate ratio, 0.695 [95% CI, 0.515 to 0.937]; P = 0.009). The intervention was most effective among participants with hospital utilization in the 6 months before index admission (P = 0.014). Adverse events were not assessed; these data were collected but are still being analyzed.
                This was a single-center study in which not all potentially eligible patients could be enrolled, and outcome assessment sometimes relied on participant report.
                A package of discharge services reduced hospital utilization within 30 days of discharge.

A nurse employed by the Municipality particularly for this project visited the hospital daily and followed the 135 participants in the intervention group with the objects of obtaining information from the primary sector if necessary, discussing discharge with the patient and the hospital staff, coordinating possible supportive measures in the patient's home and visiting the patient in his home immediately after discharge from hospital in order to ensure continuity in care and treatment. The 138 participants in the control group underwent the usual procedures in connection with admission to hospital. In this article, the consequences of the contributions by the health visitor in the hospital are described in relation to the course of hospitalization. The intervention group had an average stay in hospital of 11.0 days as compared with 14.3 days in the control group (p greater than 0.05), and the total number of bed-days were 1,490 and 1,970, respectively. In addition, the two groups were compared as regards the number of diagnostic procedures during hospitalization, the number of deaths, the diagnoses on discharge and the functional capacity. No differences were observed in these respects between the two groups. Three patients from the control group were discharged to residential institutions as compared with none in the intervention group.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)<doc-sep>Quality of life of individuals with heart failure: a randomized trial of the effectiveness of two models of hospital-to-home transition.<doc-sep>The growing number of patients with congestive heart failure has increased both the pressure on hospital resources and the need for community management of the condition. Improving hospital-to-home transition for this population is a logical step in responding to current practice guidelines' recommendations for coordination and education. Positive outcomes have been reported from trials evaluating multiple interventions, enhanced hospital discharge, and follow-up through the addition of a case management role. The question remains if similar gains could be achieved working with usual hospital and community nurses.
                A 12-week, prospective, randomized controlled trial was conducted of the effect of transitional care on health-related quality of life (disease-specific and generic measures), rates of readmission, and emergency room use. The nurse-led intervention focused on the transition from hospital-to-home and supportive care for self-management 2 weeks after hospital discharge.
                At 6 weeks after hospital discharge, the overall Minnesota Living with Heart Failure Questionnaire (MLHFQ) score was better among the Transitional Care patients (27.2 +/- 19.1 SD) than among the Usual Care patients (37.5 +/- 20.3 SD; P = 0.002). Similar results were found at 12 weeks postdischarge for the overall MLHFQ and at 6- and 12-weeks postdischarge for the MLHFQ's Physical Dimension and Emotional Dimension subscales. Differences in generic quality life, as assessed by the SF-36 Physical component, Mental Component, and General Health subscales, were not significantly different between the Transition and Usual Care groups. At 12 weeks postdischarge, 31% of the Usual Care patients had been readmitted compared with 23% of the Transitional Care patients (P = 0.26), and 46% of the Usual Care group visited the emergency department compared with 29% in the Transitional Care group (chi2 = 4.86, df 1, P = 0.03).
                There were significant improvements in health-related quality of life (HRQL) associated with Transitional Care and less use of emergency rooms.<doc-sep>Evaluation of a hospital-based community liaison pharmacy service in Northern Ireland.<doc-sep>To evaluate the impact of a hospital based community liaison pharmacy service on a range of outcomes in patients aged more than 55 years and taking more than 3 prescribed drugs, who had been admitted to the medical unit of a district general hospital in Northern Ireland.
                Having recruited 243 patients, a total of 162 patients completed the full protocol (81 randomly assigned to intervention and 81 to control; mean age of control patients 75 years; mean age of intervention patients 73 years). The interventions by the community liaison pharmacist included: preparation of an accurate medication record following a full review of current medication use; medication counselling; provision of a medicines record sheet informing the patient how to take their drugs; provision of a pharmaceutical discharge letter detailing changes made to drug therapy (this was faxed to the patient's GP and community pharmacist on the day of discharge); provision of a Medicines Helpline.
                The key findings were as follows: problems were identified in 80% of the intervention patients' prescription charts, 49% of which related to drug omissions from the patients' domiciliary prescriptions. The GP practice record was the most accurate (mean error rate 12.6%) while the GP referral letter was the least accurate (mean error rate 47.3%) source of medication information. Drugs patients brought to hospital were also an inaccurate source (mean error rate 44.0%). The intervention group patients, when compared with control patients, had a significant reduction (P = 0.005) in drug mismatch between drugs prescribed at discharge and taken at home, and had a greater knowledge of their drug regimen 10-14 days after discharge (P < 0.001). The vast majority of patients (96%) felt that the provision of a medicine helpline was a useful service.
                The study indicated clear benefits from the involvement of a hospital based community liaison pharmacist in achieving seamless pharmaceutical care between the primary and secondary healthcare settings.<doc-sep>A multidisciplinary intervention to prevent the readmission of elderly patients with congestive heart failure.<doc-sep>Congestive heart failure is the most common indication for admission to the hospital among older adults. Behavioral factors, such as poor compliance with treatment, frequently contribute to exacerbations of heart failure, a fact suggesting that many admissions could be prevented.
                We conducted a prospective, randomized trial of the effect of a nurse-directed, multidisciplinary intervention on rates of readmission within 90 days of hospital discharge, quality of life, and costs of care for high-risk patients 70 years of age or older who were hospitalized with congestive heart failure. The intervention consisted of comprehensive education of the patient and family, a prescribed diet, social-service consultation and planning for an early discharge, a review of medications, and intensive follow-up.
                Survival for 90 days without readmission, the primary outcome measure, was achieved in 91 of the 142 patients in the treatment group, as compared with 75 of the 140 patients in the control group, who received conventional care (P = 0.09). There were 94 readmissions in the control group and 53 in the treatment group (risk ratio, 0.56; P = 0.02). The number of readmissions for heart failure was reduced by 56.2 percent in the treatment group (54 vs. 24, P = 0.04), whereas the number of readmissions for other causes was reduced by 28.5 percent (40 vs. 29, P not significant). In the control group, 23 patients (16.4 percent) had more than one readmission, as compared with 9 patients (6.3 percent) in the treatment group (risk ratio, 0.39; P = 0.01). In a subgroup of 126 patients, quality-of-life scores at 90 days improved more from base line for patients in the treatment group (P = 0.001). Because of the reduction in hospital admissions, the overall cost of care was $460 less per patient in the treatment group.
                A nurse-directed, multidisciplinary intervention can improve quality of life and reduce hospital use and medical costs for elderly patients with congestive heart failure.<doc-sep>Does increased access to primary care reduce hospital readmissions? Veterans Affairs Cooperative Study Group on Primary Care and Hospital Readmission.<doc-sep>For chronically ill patients, readmission to the hospital can be frequent and costly. We studied the effect of an intervention designed to increase access to primary care after discharge from the hospital, with the goals of reducing readmissions and emergency department visits and increasing patients' quality of life and satisfaction with care.
                In a multicenter randomized, controlled trial at nine Veterans Affairs Medical Centers, we randomly assigned 1396 veterans hospitalized with diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or congestive heart failure to receive either usual care or an intensive primary care intervention. The intervention involved close follow-up by a nurse and a primary care physician, beginning before discharge and continuing for the next six months.
                The patients were severely ill. Half of those with congestive heart failure (504 patients) had disease in New York Heart Association class III or IV; 30 percent of those with diabetes (751 patients) had end-organ damage; and a quarter of those with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (583 patients) required home oxygen treatment or oral corticosteroids. The patients had extremely poor quality-of-life scores. Although they received more intensive primary care than the controls, the patients in the intervention group had significantly higher rates of readmission (0.19 vs 0.14 per month, P = 0.005) and more days of rehospitalization (10.2 vs 8.8, P = 0.041). The patients in the intervention group were more satisfied with their care (P < 0.001), but there was no difference between the study groups in quality-of-life scores, which remained very low (P = 0.53).
                For veterans discharged from Veterans Affairs hospitals, the primary care intervention we studied increased rather than decreased the rate of rehospitalization, although patients in the intervention group were more satisfied with their care.<doc-sep>Prevention of readmission in elderly patients with congestive heart failure: results of a prospective, randomized pilot study.<doc-sep>To determine the feasibility and potential impact of a non-pharmacologic multidisciplinary intervention for reducing hospital readmissions in elderly patients with congestive heart failure.
                Prospective, randomized clinical trial, with 2:1 assignment to the study intervention or usual care.
                550-bed secondary and tertiary care university teaching hospital.
                98 patients > or = 70 years of age (mean 79 +/- 6 years) admitted with documented congestive heart failure.
                Comprehensive multidisciplinary treatment strategy consisting of intensive teaching by a geriatric cardiac nurse, a detailed review of medications by a geriatric cardiologist with specific recommendations designed to improve medication compliance and reduce side effects, early consultation with social services to facilitate discharge planning, dietary teaching by a hospital dietician, and close follow-up after discharge by home care and the study team.
                All patients were followed for 90 days after initial hospital discharge. The primary study endpoints were rehospitalization within the 90-day interval and the cumulative number of days hospitalized during follow-up. The 90-day readmission rate was 33.3% (21.7%-44.9%) for the patients receiving the study intervention (n = 63) compared with 45.7% (29.2%-62.2%) for the control patients (n = 35). The mean number of days hospitalized was 4.3 +/- 1.1 (2.1-6.5) for the treated patients vs 5.7 +/- 2.0 (1.8-9.6) for the usual-care patients. In a prospectively defined subgroup of patients at intermediate risk for readmission (n = 61), readmissions were reduced by 42.2% (from 47.6% to 27.5%; p = 0.10), and the average number of hospital days during follow-up decreased from 6.7 +/- 3.2 days to 3.2 +/- 1.2 days (p = NS).
                These pilot data suggest that a comprehensive, multidisciplinary approach to reducing repetitive hospitalizations in elderly patients with congestive heart failure may lead to a reduction in readmissions and hospital days, particularly in patients at moderate risk for early rehospitalization. Further evaluation of this treatment strategy, including an assessment of the cost-effectiveness, is warranted.<doc-sep>Effects of a medical team coordinator on length of hospital stay.<doc-sep>To determine the effect of a medical team coordinator (MTC) on the length of stay in a teaching hospital.
                Randomized controlled trial.
                Two of four general medical clinical teaching units (CTUs).
                Patients admitted to the CTUs between July and October 1990 except those who were admitted directly to an intensive care unit or whose death was expected within 48 hours. The 267 patients were randomly assigned to receive either standard medical care or standard medical care plus MTC services.
                The MTC was a baccalaureate nurse whose role was to facilitate administrative tasks such as discharge planning, to coordinate tests and procedures, and to collect and collate patient information.
                Length of hospital stay. A subgroup of 40 patients was asked to complete a brief survey on medical care information and satisfaction.
                The MTC intervention reduced the mean length of stay by 1.97 days (p less than or equal to 0.04, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.02 to 2.92 days). Subanalysis by diagnostic group revealed that most of this effect was in an ill-defined group of disorders. In the survey more patients in the MTC group than in the other group reported being satisfied with their medical care (89% v. 62%; p less than or equal to 0.05, 95% CI 2% to 52%).
                The services of an MTC help to reduce the length of hospital stay for some groups of patients. Further research is necessary to examine which components of the MTC intervention are most effective and in what conditions.<doc-sep>Evaluating hospital discharge planning: a randomized clinical trial.<doc-sep>To select patients for early discharge planning, a randomized clinical trial evaluated a protocol that used risk factors identified upon hospital admission. The goal of the study was to determine if intervention with high-risk patients could reduce the need for hospital admission or skilled care. Of 13,255 patients screened, 835 study participants were identified as ""at risk"" for frequent health care resource use. Half of the high-risk patients were randomly assigned to the experimental group (n = 417) and received discharge planning from day 3 of their hospital stay, while the control group (n = 418) received discharge planning only if there was a written physician request. Those patients receiving early, systematic discharge planning experienced an increased likelihood of successful return to home after hospital admission and a decreased chance of unscheduled readmission for the 9-month study period. Length of the index hospital stay was not affected by early planning, however. The major clinical implication is the potential for discharge planners to decrease the need for, and use of, health care resources after hospital admission.<doc-sep>Reducing hospital costs for the geriatric patient admitted from the emergency department: a randomized trial.<doc-sep>To test the impact of a geriatric evaluation and management model on the costs of acute hospital management of emergently admitted older adults.
                Randomized controlled trial. Patients were followed in the acute hospital from admission through discharge. Results based on both univariate and multiple regression analyses.
                Private, nonprofit, academic medical center in a densely populated urban area.
                Adults 70 years of age and older admitted from the Emergency Department to the medicine service (non-ICU admission) who did not have an internist on staff at the admitting hospital. Of 141 randomized patients, 111 (78.7%) met eligibility criteria.
                Assignment of a geriatrician and a social worker as the primary managing team during the hospital stay.
                Length of stay, total cost of acute hospital care, cost of laboratory, pharmacy, and rehabilitation services.
                Patients in the intervention group had 2.1 fewer days of hospitalization, but this shorter length of stay was not statistically significant (P = 0.108). There were no differences in mortality or discharge disposition. In risk-adjusted, multiple regression analysis the intervention group had a statistically significant lower predicted total cost per patient than the usual care group (-$2,544, P = 0.029); assignment to the intervention group was associated with a lower predicted cost per patient for laboratory (including cardiology graphics) services (P = 0.007) and pharmacy costs (P = 0.047).
                When controlled for important predictors of expected resource use, care provided by a geriatric management team resulted in a significant reduction in the cost of hospitalization. A reduction in the cost of laboratory, cardiographic, and pharmacy services is consistent with the team's philosophy of defining the services needed based on goals related to functional outcomes.<doc-sep>Randomized controlled trial of integrated (managed) care pathway for stroke rehabilitation.<doc-sep>Integrated Care Pathway (ICP) is an organized, goal-defined, and time-managed plan that has the potential of facilitating timely interdisciplinary coordination, improving discharge planning, and reducing length of hospital stay.
                An ICP for stroke rehabilitation based on evidence of best practice, professional standards, and existing infrastructure was developed. Its effectiveness was tested in 152 stroke patients undergoing rehabilitation who were randomized to receive ICP care coordinated by an experienced nurse (n=76) or conventional multidisciplinary care (n=76).
                The age, sex, premorbid functional ability, and stroke characteristics of the 2 groups were comparable. There were no differences in mortality rates (10 [13%] versus 6 [8%]), institutionalization (10 [13%] versus 16 [21%]), or length of hospital stay (50+/-19 versus 45+/-23 days) between patients receiving ICP or multidisciplinary care. Patients receiving conventional multidisciplinary care improved significantly faster between 4 and 12 weeks (median change in Barthel Activities of Daily Living Index 6 versus 2; P<0.01) and had higher Quality of Life scores at 12 weeks (65 versus 59; P=0.07) and 6 months (72 versus 63; P<0.005). There were no significant differences in the mean duration of physiotherapy (42.8+/-41.2 versus 39.4+/-36.4 hours) or occupational therapy (8.5+/-7.5 versus 8.0+/-7.5 hours) received between the 2 groups.
                ICP management offered no benefit over conventional multidisciplinary care on a stroke rehabilitation unit. Functional recovery was faster and Quality of Life outcomes better in patients receiving conventional multidisciplinary care.<doc-sep>The feasibility and efficacy of early discharge planning initiated by the admitting department in two acute care hospitals.<doc-sep>To determine the feasibility and efficacy of early discharge planning, initiated by admitting department personnel, a randomized, controlled trial was undertaken in 2 acute care, university-affiliated hospitals. The intervention tested was referral of patients by admitting personnel to nursing, social work, physiotherapy, occupational therapy, or dietary services for potential discharge planning. A 1-page, 65-item questionnaire was designed to identify patients for referral to the various allied health services. A copy of this was sent to the appropriate service, according to predefined criteria. The questionnaire took an average of 4 min to complete. The criteria used were highly predictive of length of stay, the most important being age, followed by living outside St. John's, admission within the previous 3 months, emergency admission, and being in need of community services. In Hospital A, the cases (n = 421) referred for early discharge planning had significantly shorter length of stay (Mantel-Cox, p = 0.03) than controls (n = 420), who were identical for all factors predictive of prolonged length of stay. The reduction in length of stay amounted to a mean of 0.8 d. In Hospital B (n = 758), the intervention was less effective because of a lower proportion of patients with factors associated with prolonged hospital stay and, perhaps, because of inadequate implementation of the program. We conclude that identification, by admitting department personnel, of patients who may benefit from early discharge planning is feasible. This process will reduce length of hospital stay, but its effectiveness is dependent on case mix variables and enthusiastic implementation of the program.<doc-sep>Redefining and redesigning hospital discharge to enhance patient care: a randomized controlled study.<doc-sep>Patients are routinely ill-prepared for the transition from hospital to home. Inadequate communication between Hospitalists and primary care providers can further compromise post-discharge care. Redesigning the discharge process may improve the continuity and the quality of patient care.
                To evaluate a low-cost intervention designed to promptly reconnect patients to their ""medical home"" after hospital discharge.
                Randomized controlled study. Intervention patients received a ""user-friendly"" Patient Discharge Form, and upon arrival at home, a telephone outreach from a nurse at their primary care site.
                A culturally and linguistically diverse group of patients admitted to a small community teaching hospital.
                Four undesirable outcomes were measured after hospital discharge: (1) no outpatient follow-up within 21 days; (2) readmission within 31 days; (3) emergency department visit within 31 days; and (4) failure by the primary care provider to complete an outpatient workup recommended by the hospital doctors. Outcomes of the intervention group were compared to concurrent and historical controls.
                Only 25.5% of intervention patients had 1 or more undesirable outcomes compared to 55.1% of the concurrent and 55.0% of the historical controls. Notably, only 14.9% of the intervention patients failed to follow-up within 21 days compared to 40.8% of the concurrent and 35.0% of the historical controls. Only 11.5% of recommended outpatient workups in the intervention group were incomplete versus 31.3% in the concurrent and 31.0% in the historical controls.
                A low-cost discharge-transfer intervention may improve the rates of outpatient follow-up and of completed workups after hospital discharge.<doc-sep>","The evidence suggests that a discharge plan tailored to the individual patient probably brings about reductions in hospital length of stay and readmission rates for older people admitted to hospital with a medical condition.

17,"Early randomized intervention with high-frequency jet ventilation in respiratory distress syndrome.<doc-sep>To determine whether early use of high-frequency jet ventilation reduces neonatal mortality or pulmonary morbidity rates, we randomly selected 42 infants with clinical and radiographic evidence of severe respiratory distress syndrome to receive either high-frequency jet ventilation or conventional ventilation. Separate sequential analyses (two-sided, alpha = 0.05, power = 0.95 to detect 85:15 advantage) were performed for mortality rates, air leaks, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, intraventricular hemorrhage, and assignment crossover, and a combined analysis was performed, with death overriding other outcome variables. Enrollment was completed when the combined analysis reached the sequential design boundary indicating no treatment difference. Mortality rates (19% among infants receiving high-frequency jet ventilation vs 24% among infants receiving conventional ventilation), the incidence of air leaks (48% vs 52%), bronchopulmonary dysplasia (39% vs 41%), and intraventricular hemorrhage (33% vs 43%), and assignment crossovers (14% vs 24%) did not differs significantly between the treatment groups. We conclude that early use of high-frequency jet ventilation does not prevent or substantially reduce mortality or morbidity rates associated with assisted ventilation.<doc-sep>Multicenter controlled clinical trial of high-frequency jet ventilation in preterm infants with uncomplicated respiratory distress syndrome.<doc-sep>To test the hypothesis that high-frequency jet ventilation (HFJV) will reduce the incidence and/or severity of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) and acute airleak in premature infants who, despite surfactant administration, require mechanical ventilation for respiratory distress syndrome.
                Multicenter, randomized, controlled clinical trial of HFJV and conventional ventilation (CV). Patients were to remain on assigned therapy for 14 days or until extubation, whichever came first. Crossover from CV to HFJV was allowed if bilateral pulmonary interstitial emphysema or bronchopleural fistula developed. Patients could cross over to the other ventilatory mode if failure criteria were met. The optimal lung volume strategy was mandated for HFJV by protocol to provide alveolar recruitment and optimize lung volume and ventilation/perfusion matching, while minimizing pressure amplitude and O2 requirements. CV management was not controlled by protocol.
                Eight tertiary neonatal intensive care units.
                Preterm infants with birth weights between 700 and 1500 g and gestational age <36 weeks who required mechanical ventilation with FIO2 >0.30 at 2 to 12 hours after surfactant administration, received surfactant by 8 hours of age, were <20 hours old, and had been ventilated for <12 hours. Outcome Measures. Primary outcome variables were BPD at 28 days and 36 weeks of postconceptional age. Secondary outcome variables were survival, gas exchange, airway pressures, airleak, intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH), periventricular leukomalacia (PVL), and other nonpulmonary complications.
                A total of 130 patients were included in the final analysis; 65 were randomized to HFJV and 65 to CV. The groups were of comparable birth weight, gestational age, severity of illness, postnatal age, and other demographics. The incidence of BPD at 36 weeks of postconceptional age was significantly lower in babies randomized to HFJV compared with CV (20.0% vs 40.4%). The need for home oxygen was also significantly lower in infants receiving HFJV compared with CV (5.5% vs 23.1%). Survival, incidence of BPD at 28 days, retinopathy of prematurity, airleak, pulmonary hemorrhage, grade I-II IVH, and other complications were similar. In retrospect, it was noted that the traditional HFJV strategy emphasizing low airway pressures (HF-LO) rather than the prescribed optimal volume strategy (HF-OPT) was used in 29/65 HFJV infants. This presented a unique opportunity to examine the effects of different HFJV strategies on gas exchange, airway pressures, and outcomes. HF-OPT was defined as increase in positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) by >/=1 cm H2O from pre-HFJV baseline and/or use of PEEP of >/=7 cm H2O. Severe neuroimaging abnormalities (PVL and/or grade III-IV IVH) were not different between the CV and HFJV infants. However, there was a significantly lower incidence of severe IVH/PVL in HFJV infants treated with HF-OPT compared with CV and HF-LO. Oxygenation was similar between CV and HFJV groups as a whole, but HF-OPT infants had better oxygenation compared with the other two groups. There were no differences in PaCO2 between CV and HFJV, but the PaCO2 was lower for HF-LO compared with the other two groups. The peak inspiratory pressure and DeltaP (peak inspiratory pressure-PEEP) were lower for HFJV infants compared with CV infants.
                HFJV reduces the incidence of BPD at 36 weeks and the need for home oxygen in premature infants with uncomplicated RDS, but does not reduce the risk of acute airleak. There is no increase in adverse outcomes compared with CV. HF-OPT improves oxygenation, decreases exposure to hypocarbia, and reduces the risk of grade III-IV IVH and/or PVL.<doc-sep>High-frequency jet ventilation in the early management of respiratory distress syndrome is associated with a greater risk for adverse outcomes.<doc-sep>The objective of this investigation was to determine if high-frequency jet ventilation (HFJV) used early in the treatment of premature infants with respiratory distress syndrome was effective in reducing pulmonary morbidity without increasing the occurrence of adverse neurologic outcomes.
                A total of 73 premature infants who met the inclusion criteria (gestational age of less than 33 weeks, birth weight of more than 500 g, age of less than 24 hours, need for assisted ventilation with peak inspiratory pressure of more than 16 and FIO2 more than 0.30, and roentgenographic evidence of respiratory distress syndrome) were randomized to either conventional (n = 36) or to high-frequency jet (n = 37) ventilation. Our goals were to maintain the infants on the assigned ventilator for at least 7 days unless they could either be extubated or meet crossover criteria. Univariate analyses were initially used to compare the two groups. Stepwise logistic regression was subsequently used to assess whether various factors independently influenced adverse outcomes.
                The two groups of infants were similar in all obstetrical, perinatal, and neonatal demographic characteristics. The mean birth weight and gestational age in the conventional group were 930 g and 26.6 weeks and in the HFJV group, 961 g and 26.9 weeks. The infants were randomized at similar ages (7.1 and 7.3 hours of life, respectively). Their prerandomization ventilator settings and arterial blood gases were nearly identical. There were no differences in pulmonary outcomes (occurrence of air leaks, need for oxygen or ventilation at 36 weeks postconception), and there were no differences in the mean number of days oxygen was required, number of days ventilated, or length of hospital stay. Infants ventilated with HFJV were significantly more likely to develop cystic periventricular leukomalacia (10 vs 2, P = .022) or to have a poor outcome (grade IV hemorrhage, cystic periventricular leukomalacia, or death) (17 vs 7, P = .016). Logistic regression analysis revealed HFJV to be a significant independent predictor of both cystic periventricular leukomalacia and a poor outcome. The presence of hypocarbia was not an independently significant predictor of adverse outcomes.
                With the HFJV treatment strategy that we used, use of the high-frequency jet ventilator in the early management of premature infants with respiratory distress syndrome resulted in significantly more adverse outcomes than in those treated with conventional mechanical ventilation.<doc-sep>",The overall analysis shows a benefit in pulmonary outcomes in the group electively ventilated with HFJV. Of concern is the significant increase in acute brain injury in one trial which used lower mean airway pressures when ventilating with HFJV. There are as yet no long term pulmonary or neurodevelopmental outcomes from any of the trials.,There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of HFJV in preterm infants with uncomplicated RDS.,CD000328
18,"Availability of iron and degree of inflammation modifies the response to recombinant human erythropoietin when treating anemia of chronic disease in patients with rheumatoid arthritis.<doc-sep>Forty-six patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and documented anemia of chronic disease (Hb < 100/110 g/l) were randomized to receive either human recombinant erythropoietin (r-HuEPO, n = 36, 300 U/kg body weight) or placebo (n = 10) for 12 weeks in a multicenter study. An adequate response was defined as elevation of Hb > or = 120 g/l. Relevant clinical and laboratory assessments were made to evaluate efficacy and secure safety. A significant elevation in Hb from week 10 onwards was noted in twenty-six patients (five drop-outs) out of nine patients receiving placebo (one drop-out) (12 +/- 1.2 g/l vs 4 +/- 0.5 g/l; Hb elevation from 95 g/l to 107 g/l vs 93 g/l to 97 g/l, P < 0.05). Only 14.6%, however, were considered responders according to preset criteria. In the responders a lower initial CRP, a significant reduction in ESR but not in CRP was seen compared to the remaining r-HuEPO group. A significant elevation of energy level was noted in the r-HuEPO group; otherwise, no differences in clinical variables were seen. No serious adverse effects were noted. When analyzing patients receiving oral iron in combination with r-HuEPO and adding five additional, openly selected patients receiving both adequate iron supplementation and r-HuEPO, there was a significant weekly elevation of Hb from week 8 onwards in favor of combination therapy over the ones only receiving r-HuEPO (18 +/- 1.1 g/l vs 7 +/- 1.1 g/l, P < 0.05). The initial six responders had now reached ten of whom seven belonged to the combination therapy group. Response to r-HuEPO in RA patients appears to be dependent on availability of iron and on the degree of inflammation. If r-HuEPO treatment is considered, iron deficiency should always be corrected and strenuous efforts should have been made to control the disease itself.<doc-sep>Multicenter study of recombinant human erythropoietin in correction of anemia in rheumatoid arthritis.<doc-sep>To administer recombinant erythropoietin to patients with rheumatoid arthritis who had significant anemia, while monitoring hematologic and rheumatologic clinical responses as well as potential toxicity.
                Seventeen patients with rheumatoid arthritis from five rheumatology care settings were studied. The patients had initial hematocrits of 34% or less and stable clinical status, and were not being treated with second-line drugs or corticosteroids. An 8-week randomized double-blind study involving various dosages of recombinant erythropoietin, as well as placebo, was followed by a 24-week open-label study in which dosage could be titrated to achieve a normal hematocrit.
                In the 8-week randomized study, four of 13 patients who received injections of recombinant erythropoietin showed a hematologic response, arbitrarily defined as at least a 6-unit increase in hematocrit. None of four placebo-treated patients showed a meaningful hematologic response. All 11 patients who completed the subsequent 24-week open-label study reached a normal hematocrit level at some time during the study, and 10 of 11 showed an increase of hematocrit 6 units or greater. At least one adjustment, i.e., an increase, decrease, or omission of the erythropoietin dosage, was required in all patients to maintain the hematocrit at a target range of 35% for women or 40% for men. Meaningful changes were not seen in patients' capacity to perform activities of daily living or pain levels during either the 8-week randomized study or the 24-week open-label study. No adverse effects were associated with recombinant erythropoietin therapy.
                Patients with rheumatoid arthritis showed excellent hematologic responses to recombinant erythropoietin, without toxicity, during careful monitoring for appropriate dosage adjustment, although a meaningful change in rheumatologic clinical status was not seen.<doc-sep>Effect of recombinant human erythropoietin on anaemia and disease activity in patients with rheumatoid arthritis and anaemia of chronic disease: a randomised placebo controlled double blind 52 weeks clinical trial.<doc-sep>To study whether recombinant human erythropoietin (r-hu-Epo) improves anaemia and reduces disease activity in patients with rheumatoid arthritis and anaemia of chronic disease (ACD).
                A 52 week placebo controlled randomised double blind trial with r-hu-Epo was performed in 70 patients with active rheumatoid arthritis and ACD. Thirty four patients were treated with 240 U kg-1 r-hu-Epo subcutaneously, initially three doses weekly, while 36 patients received placebo.
                A significant increase of haemoglobin from a median of 112 to 135 g litre-1 occurred in the Epo group within six weeks and could be sustained with reduced doses (median 240 U kg-1 once weekly). Sustained benefit compared to placebo was also apparent by six weeks for disease activity, as indicated by the Paulus 20% response rate. Of patients in the Epo group, 32% eventually showed a Paulus 20% response, compared to 8% of the placebo group (P = 0.016). Significant differences in favour of the Epo group were also observed in the secondary disease activity measures Ritchie index, number of swollen joints, pain score, ESR, and patients' global assessment of disease activity. C reactive protein concentrations did not change significantly.

19,"Individualised homeopathy as an adjunct in the treatment of childhood asthma: a randomised placebo controlled trial.<doc-sep>Homeopathy is frequently used to treat asthma in children. In the common classical form of homeopathy, prescriptions are individualised for each patient. There has been no rigorous investigation into this form of treatment for asthma.
                In a randomised, double blind, placebo controlled trial the effects of individualised homeopathic remedies were compared with placebo medication in 96 children with mild to moderate asthma as an adjunct to conventional treatment. The main outcome measure was the active quality of living subscale of the Childhood Asthma Questionnaire administered at baseline and follow up at 12 months. Other outcome measures included other subscales of the same questionnaire, peak flow rates, use of medication, symptom scores, days off school, asthma events, global assessment of change, and adverse reactions.
                There were no clinically relevant or statistically significant changes in the active quality of life score. Other subscales, notably those measuring severity, indicated relative improvements but the sizes of the effects were small. There were no differences between the groups for other measures.
                This study provides no evidence that adjunctive homeopathic remedies, as prescribed by experienced homeopathic practitioners, are superior to placebo in improving the quality of life of children with mild to moderate asthma in addition to conventional treatment in primary care.<doc-sep>","There is not enough evidence to reliably assess the possible role of homeopathy in asthma.

0,"Fetal lung maturation: the combined use of corticosteroids and thyrotropin-releasing hormone.<doc-sep>The purpose of this randomized study was to evaluate whether the combined use of corticosteroids and thyrotropin-releasing hormone would enhance fetal lung maturation to a greater degree than would corticosteroids alone. The study was restricted to patients under 34 weeks' gestation with a lecithin/sphingomyelin (L/S) ratio less than 2.0. The patients were randomized into a study group receiving intravenous thyrotropin-releasing hormone along with intramuscular corticosteroids over 48 hours and a control group receiving only corticosteroids. Patients undelivered 1 week after the onset of therapy underwent a repeat amniocentesis to document changes in the L/S ratio. In those patients delivering within 1 week of therapy, the neonatal clinical course was established by two investigators blinded to the antenatal therapy. Compared with the control group, the group receiving antenatal corticosteroids plus thyrotropin-releasing hormone showed a greater post-therapy increase in L/S ratio, fewer respirator days, and a lower incidence of bronchopulmonary dysplasia. The results of this study suggest that the combined use of corticosteroids and thyrotropin-releasing hormone results in enhanced fetal pulmonic maturation superior to that achieved with corticosteroids alone.<doc-sep>Combined hormonal therapy for the prevention of respiratory distress syndrome and its consequences.<doc-sep>In performing this meta-analysis, we have attempted to use comparable data, but there are limitations to the information that is available at present. Some studies reported results for all patients entered, whereas others reported only optimally treated patients (Table 2). Many of the trials have not yet been published in final form and subjected to peer review. In addition, all the studies reported here were conducted before the widespread use of surfactant therapy. It is unclear whether the benefit of antenatal TRH and steroid therapy on end points such as death or BPD would persist if surfactant was also used. (Surfactant has, however, little impact on the percentage of survivors with BPD, perhaps because sicker infants survive with this treatment and go on to develop BPD.) Studies comparing antenatal TRH plus steroid plus postnatal surfactant to antenatal steroid plus postnatal surfactant are clearly required, and are in progress in a number of centers around the world. Because of these limitations, the routine use of antenatal TRH plus steroid cannot be currently recommended. However, the apparent benefits of this therapy in terms of RDS, death, and CLD that have been reported here do suggest that it might be used in selected situations. An example is threatened delivery of a very premature infant with an immature amniotic fluid pulmonary maturation profile. These infants are at risk for RDS and CLD, even if antenatal steroid and postnatal surfactant therapy is used.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)<doc-sep>A randomized, controlled trial of antepartum thyrotropin-releasing hormone and betamethasone in the prevention of respiratory disease in preterm infants.<doc-sep>The objective was to investigate whether the addition of thyrotropin-releasing hormone to antepartum betamethasone further reduces the incidence of respiratory disease in preterm infants.
                A randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial of antepartum thyrotropin-releasing hormone (400 micrograms given intravenously four times) and betamethasone (5 mg given intramuscularly four times) was conducted in 378 mothers likely to be delivered between 24 and 32.6 weeks' gestation. Statistical analysis was by relative risk, chi 2, t tests, and multiple logistic regression analysis.
                Four hundred five live-born infants were delivered. In infants without lethal abnormalities delivered between 24 hours and 10 days from entry (n = 175) the incidence of respiratory distress syndrome was reduced from 52% to 31% (relative risk 0.61, 95% confidence interval 0.41 to 0.89) and that of severe respiratory distress syndrome from 42% to 20% (relative risk 0.48, 95% confidence interval 0.29 to 0.78) in the placebo and thyrotropin-releasing hormone groups, respectively. The number of deaths fell from 14 to one (relative risk 0.08, 95% confidence interval 0.01 to 0.63). The incidence of chronic lung disease was not significantly different, but that of an adverse outcome (chronic lung disease or death by 36 weeks' gestation) fell from 29% in the placebo group to 16% with thyrotropin-releasing hormone (relative risk 0.55, 95% confidence interval 0.31 to 0.99).

Neonates weighing < 1.0 kg received prophylactic surfactant and those above that weight received rescue therapy.
                One hundred ninety women received thyrotropin-releasing hormone and 180 were given placebo. There were no differences in the frequency of respiratory distress syndrome (relative risk 1.17 [95% confidence interval 0.93 to 1.48]), use of oxygen at age 28 days (1.14 [0.80 to 1.62]), or neonatal mortality (1.05 [0.79 to 1.38]). Air leaks were more frequent in the thyrotropin-releasing hormone group (1.57 [1.23 to 2.01]).

                Primary: death of the baby or chronic lung disease (defined as oxygen dependency at 28 days after birth). Secondary: other measures of respiratory morbidity, in particular respiratory distress syndrome. Other measures of short term neonatal morbidity including intraventricular haemorrhage and necrotising enterocolitis. Measures of maternal side effects.
                The antenatal TRH trial was halted early on the basis of external evidence. Overall a total of 225 women were recruited who delivered 275 babies. The primary outcome of death or chronic lung disease occurred in 33 babies in the TRH group and 43 babies in the placebo group (RR 0.8, 95% CI 0.5-1.2). There were no other differences between the two groups. Stratified analysis did not reveal any differences between the two groups depending on how long before the time of delivery the mother had received the TRH or placebo.
                These trials are too small to provide convincing evidence of the effect of antenatal TRH on neonatal outcome. When added to the existing systematic review and meta-analysis, however, these data should provide evidence on which subsequent practice can be based.

TRH Study Group.<doc-sep>Although prenatal glucocorticoid treatment reduces neonatal respiratory morbidity, respiratory distress syndrome and chronic lung disease (CLD) develop in many very-low-birthweight infants despite therapy. To investigate the effect of additional prenatal treatment with thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH), we did a multicentre, blinded, randomised trial. 404 women with threatened preterm delivery at less than 32 weeks' gestation received betamethasone plus TRH (4 doses of 400 micrograms 8-hourly) or betamethasone plus placebo. 103 infants who were fully treated and of less than 1500 g birthweight were evaluated during the neonatal period. TRH treatment (55 infants) did not affect the total incidence of respiratory distress syndrome (47% vs 58% in controls) or of severe respiratory distress syndrome (13% vs 25% in controls, p = 0.11). CLD (defined as requirement for supplemental oxygen at 28 days after birth) developed in significantly fewer TRH-treated infants (18% vs 44% of controls, p less than 0.01). The unadjusted relative risk of CLD with TRH therapy was 0.40 (95% CI 0.26-0.80, p less than 0.05), and this was not materially changed after adjustment for potentially modifying variables. There were significantly fewer adverse outcomes, defined as death or continuing oxygen requirement, in the TRH group than in the steroid-alone group both at 28 days and when infants reached 36 weeks' postconceptional age. The incidence of other complications of prematurity was similar in the two groups.

                We enrolled 996 women at 13 North American centers who were in preterm labor at <30 weeks' gestation in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized trial of antenatal thyrotropin-releasing hormone, given intravenously in four doses of 400 microg each at eight-hour intervals. The primary outcome was chronic lung disease or death of the infant on or before the 28th day after delivery, and secondary outcomes were respiratory distress syndrome and chronic lung disease or death at 36 weeks' postmenstrual age. Complete data were available for 981 women and their 1134 live-born infants. The 769 infants born at < or = 32 weeks' gestation were defined as the group at risk.
                There were no significant differences between the at-risk treatment and placebo groups in mean (+/-SD) birth weight (1109+/-354 vs. 1097+/-355 g), gestational age (27.9+/-2.1 vs. 27.9+/-2.1 weeks), sex, or race. The frequencies of respiratory distress syndrome (66 percent vs. 65 percent), death at 28 days (11 percent vs. 11 percent), chronic lung disease or death at 28 days (45 percent vs. 42 percent) and at 36 weeks (32 percent vs. 34 percent), and other neonatal complications as well as the severity of lung disease were not significantly different in the at-risk treatment and placebo groups. Similarly, there were no differences in outcome between the treatment and placebo groups for the infants born at >32 weeks' gestation.

Results of a multicenter study carried out in the Paris region].<doc-sep>1,969 non immunized rhesus negative primiparous women were followed up in 23 maternity units in the geographical region of Paris. 1,882 could be retained to study antepartum protection and 1,884 to study transplacental passage of fetal blood cells. Two groups were defined according to whether they were born in even or uneven years, so that: 955 were the ""control"" group who delivered 590 rhesus D positive infants, and 927 were the ""treated"" group who delivered 599 rhesus D positive infants. The ""control"" group were used as controls at the 28th and 34th weeks of pregnancy, while the ""treated"" group received two injections of anti-D immunoglobulin given on the same dates after taking the necessary tests. Immunological testing at the time of the delivery and after the delivery showed that 7 women had become Rh D immunized in the ""control"" group whereas only one in the ""treated"" group. This difference, which is statistically significant, confirms the results of other authors about the efficiency of antepartum rhesus disease prevention. The incidence of immunisation during or immediately after the first pregnancy in women who had no previous story of blood transfusions or of terminations of pregnancy is 1.11%, which is a figure relatively low as compared with studies of series carried out in North America, but close to those carried out in other European centres. When primipara of all categories are lumped together the frequency rises to 1.5%. A study of the passage of fetal red blood cells into the maternal circulation shows that at the 29th week of pregnancy out of 1,884 cases there were 5.5% positive kleihauer tests, without a large volume of blood being detected and at the 34th week of pregnancy when 957 tests were carried out, 7% were positive with one of them being of a massive transfusion of blood from the fetus to the mother, which was life-threatening for the fetus. It may be that the incidence had been under-estimated and that the positive results in the two groups, control and treated, show that there is a statistically significant difference that demonstrates that antepartum treatment in the trial has eliminated a worthwhile percentage of positive kleihauer tests which arose from the transfusion of small quantities of blood.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)<doc-sep>Multicentre trial of antepartum low-dose anti-D immunoglobulin.<doc-sep>Routine antenatal Rh immunoprophylaxis would substantially increase the use of anti-D Ig in the U.K. As availability of anti-D Ig is one factor influencing a decision to introduce routine antenatal prophylaxis, a trial was undertaken to test the efficacy of a lower dose of anti-D Ig than that used in earlier studies. RhD-negative primigravidae were randomized as controls or recipients of two doses of 250iu of anti-D Ig given at 28 and 34 weeks gestation.

Division of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Torreon, Coah, Mexico. The patients were all the women admitted to the labor and delivery ward with diagnosis of severe pre-eclampsia and viable conceptus were assigned at random to receive either Diazepam (Group A, n = 19) or Magnesium sulfate (group B, n = 19). There were no significant differences between both groups. All of the patients remained alert, conscious and well oriented. None of the newborns showed hiporreflexia, flaccidity or neonatal respiratory distress that could be implicated to the anticonvulsivant therapy. It is concluded that Diazepam and Magnesium sulfate are good alternatives as anticonvulsivant therapy in cases of severe pre-eclampsia.<doc-sep>A comparison of magnesium sulfate with phenytoin for the prevention of eclampsia.<doc-sep>Magnesium sulfate is used widely to prevent eclamptic seizures in pregnant women with hypertension, but few studies have compared the efficacy of magnesium sulfate with that of other drugs. Anticonvulsant prophylaxis with phenytoin for eclampsia has been recommended, but there are virtually no data to support its efficacy. Our objective was to compare magnesium sulfate with phenytoin in preventing seizures in hypertensive women during labor.
                We randomly assigned women with hypertension who were admitted for delivery to receive either magnesium sulfate or phenytoin. The magnesium sulfate regimen consisted of a 10-g intramuscular loading dose followed by a maintenance dose of 5 g given intramuscularly every four hours. For women with severe preeclampsia, an additional 4-g loading dose was given intravenously. The phenytoin regimen included a 1000-mg loading dose infused over a period of 1 hour, followed by a 500-mg oral dose 10 hours later. With either regimen, anticonvulsant therapy was continued for 24 hours post partum.
                Ten of 1089 women randomly assigned to the phenytoin regimen had eclamptic convulsions, as compared with none of 1049 women randomly assigned to magnesium sulfate (P = 0.004). There were no significant differences in any risk factors for eclampsia between the two study groups. Maternal and infant outcomes were also similar in the two study groups.
                Magnesium sulfate is superior to phenytoin for the prevention of eclampsia in hypertensive pregnant women. These results validate the long-practiced use of magnesium sulfate in the prevention of eclampsia.<doc-sep>Comparison of magnesium and methyldopa for the control of blood pressure in pregnancies complicated with hypertension.<doc-sep>Although magnesium is now the drug of choice for the prevention of eclamptic seizures only few studies have evaluated whether magnesium may reduce blood pressure in pregnancies complicated with hypertension.
                A total of 33 patients with pregnancy-induced hypertension were randomized to either magnesium or methyldopa treatment. Of these 16 received magnesium and 17 methyldopa. The treatment comprised a 48-hour magnesium infusion followed by oral magnesium tablets until 3 days after delivery or 250 mg methyldopa 4 times a day in a similar period.
                Patients treated with magnesium had 1 day after inclusion a statistically significantly lower systolic blood pressure compared to the level in the methyldopa group (138.1 +/- 11 vs. 147.6 +/- 11 mm Hg; p < 0.05), but no difference was observed in diastolic blood pressure (92.0 +/- 6.6 vs. 96.0 +/- 10.1 mm Hg; NS). From the 5th day of inclusion and until delivery both systolic and diastolic blood pressure were significantly lower in the magnesium group (p < 0.05). Including all blood pressure measurements in a single analysis showed that both systolic (138 +/- 13 vs. 148 +/- 15 mm Hg; p < 0.0001) and diastolic (92 +/- 10 vs. 94 +/- 10 mm Hg; p < 0.05) blood pressure were lower in the magnesium group compared to the methyldopa group. There was no difference between the two groups regarding gestational age at delivery, birth weight, Apgar scores and pH in umbilical cord blood.
                This preliminary study demonstrates that magnesium treatment lowers blood pressure in pregnancies complicated with hypertension. The effect is without any adverse effect on maternal and neonatal well-being.

Karger AG, Basel<doc-sep>The effect of magnesium sulfate therapy on the duration of labor in women with mild preeclampsia at term: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial.<doc-sep>The primary outcome was to determine whether magnesium sulfate therapy prolongs the duration of labor in women with mild preeclampsia. Secondary outcomes were to assess the side effects associated with magnesium sulfate therapy: hours and maximum dose of oxytocin, incidence of progression to severe preeclampsia, incidence of cesarean delivery, change in maternal hematocrit, incidence of postpartum hemorrhage, incidence of maternal infection, and Apgar scores.
                Women with a diagnosis of mild preeclampsia at term were randomized to receive standard therapy during labor and for 12 hours post partum with either magnesium sulfate (n = 67) or a matching placebo solution (n = 68).
                There was no difference between magnesium sulfate and placebo with respect to the primary outcome variables: total length of labor (median 17.8 hours vs 16.5 hours, p = 0.7) and length of the active phase of labor (median 5.4 hours vs 6.0 hours, p = 0.5). In addition, no difference was observed in the secondary outcome variables: hours of oxytocin use, change in hematocrit, frequency of maternal infection, progression to severe preeclampsia, incidence of cesarean delivery, and Apgar scores. Although not statistically significant, the incidence of postpartum hemorrhage was approximately fourfold greater in the magnesium sulfate group (relative risk 4.1, 95% confidence interval 0.5 to 35.4). There was a significant difference in the maximum dose of oxytocin used (13.9 +/- 8.6 mU/min with magnesium sulfate vs 11.0 +/- 7.6 mU/min with placebo, p = 0.036).
                The use of magnesium sulfate during labor in women with mild preeclampsia at term does not affect any component of labor but did necessitate a higher dose of oxytocin.<doc-sep>Do women with pre-eclampsia, and their babies, benefit from magnesium sulphate? The Magpie Trial: a randomised placebo-controlled trial.<doc-sep>Anticonvulsants are used for pre-eclampsia in the belief they prevent eclamptic convulsions, and so improve outcome. Evidence supported magnesium sulphate as the drug to evaluate.
                Eligible women (n=10141) had not given birth or were 24 h or less postpartum; blood pressure of 140/90 mm Hg or more, and proteinuria of 1+ (30 mg/dL) or more; and there was clinical uncertainty about magnesium sulphate. Women were randomised in 33 countries to either magnesium sulphate (n=5071) or placebo (n=5070). Primary outcomes were eclampsia and, for women randomised before delivery, death of the baby. Follow up was until discharge from hospital after delivery. Analyses were by intention to treat.
                Follow-up data were available for 10,110 (99.7%) women, 9992 (99%) of whom received the allocated treatment. 1201 of 4999 (24%) women given magnesium sulphate reported side-effects versus 228 of 4993 (5%) given placebo. Women allocated magnesium sulphate had a 58% lower risk of eclampsia (95% CI 40-71) than those allocated placebo (40, 0.8%, vs 96, 1.9%; 11 fewer women with eclampsia per 1000 women). Maternal mortality was also lower among women allocated magnesium sulphate (relative risk 0.55, 0.26-1.14). For women randomised before delivery, there was no clear difference in the risk of the baby dying (576, 12.7%, vs 558, 12.4%; relative risk 1.02, 99% CI 0.92-1.14). The only notable difference in maternal or neonatal morbidity was for placental abruption (relative risk 0.67, 99% CI 0.45-0.89).
                Magnesium sulphate halves the risk of eclampsia, and probably reduces the risk of maternal death. There do not appear to be substantive harmful effects to mother or baby in the short term.<doc-sep>Does magnesium sulfate affect the length of labor induction in women with pregnancy-associated hypertension?<doc-sep>Our purpose was to determine whether seizure prophylaxis with magnesium sulfate prolongs induction of labor in women with pregnancy-associated hypertension.

Women with rupture of the membranes, spontaneous contractions resulting in cervical change, or an initial cervical examination showing > 2 cm dilatation and 50% effacement were excluded.
                Fifty-four women were randomized to receive either magnesium sulfate (n = 28) or phenytoin (n = 26). The two groups were similar for selected maternal antepartum, intrapartum, and postpartum characteristics that have been associated with a prolongation or failure of labor induction. The two groups were also similar for the interval from the start of induction to (1) the first examination > or = 5 cm cervical dilatation and (2) delivery and in the frequency of women requiring cesarean delivery.
                Compared with phenytoin, magnesium sulfate seizure prophylaxis in women with pregnancy-associated hypertension does not prolong the induction of labor nor does it result in an increase in cesarean deliveries.<doc-sep>Magnesium sulfate in women with mild preeclampsia: a randomized controlled trial.<doc-sep>To determine whether magnesium sulfate prevents disease progression in women with mild preeclampsia.
                A total of 222 women with mild preeclampsia were randomized to receive intravenous magnesium sulfate (n = 109) or matched placebo (n = 113). Mild preeclampsia was defined as blood pressure of at least 140/90 mm Hg taken on two occasions in the presence of new-onset proteinuria. Patients with chronic hypertension or severe preeclampsia were excluded. Patients were considered to have disease progression if they developed signs or symptoms of severe preeclampsia, eclampsia, or laboratory abnormalities of full or partial HELLP (hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, low platelets) syndrome.
                The groups were similar with respect to maternal age, ethnicity, gestational age, parity, and maternal weight at enrollment. Fourteen women (12.8%) in the magnesium group and 19 (16.8%) in the placebo group developed severe preeclampsia after randomization (relative risk = 0.8, 95% confidence interval 0.4, 1.5, P =.41). None in either group developed eclampsia or thrombocytopenia. Women assigned magnesium had similar rates of cesarean delivery (30% versus 25%), chorioamnionitis (3% versus 2.7%), endometritis (5.3% versus 4.3%), and postpartum hemorrhage (1% versus 0.9%), compared to those assigned placebo. Neonates born to women assigned magnesium had similar mean Apgar scores at 1 and 5 minutes as those born to women assigned placebo (7.7 +/- 1.5 versus 7.8 +/- 1.6 and 8.7 +/- 0.7 versus 8.8 +/- 0.6, respectively).
                Magnesium sulfate does not have a major impact on disease progression in women with mild preeclampsia. Magnesium use does not seem to increase rates of cesarean delivery, infectious morbidity, obstetric hemorrhage, or neonatal depression.<doc-sep>A randomised controlled trial of intravenous magnesium sulphate versus placebo in the management of women with severe pre-eclampsia.<doc-sep>To determine whether the administration of prophylactic intravenous magnesium sulphate reduces the occurrence of eclampsia in women with severe pre-eclampsia.

                Eight hundred and twenty-two women with severe pre-eclampsia requiring termination of pregnancy by induction of labour or caesarean section.

                The occurrence of eclampsia in the two groups.
                The data of 699 women were evaluated. Fourteen were withdrawn after randomisation. The overall incidence of eclampsia was 1.8%. Of 345 women who received magnesium sulphate, one developed eclampsia (0.3%); in the placebo group, 11/340 women (3.2%) developed eclampsia (relative risk 0.09; 95% confidence interval 0.01-0.69; P = 0.003).
                The use of intravenous magnesium sulphate in the management of women with severe pre-eclampsia significantly reduced the development of eclampsia.<doc-sep>Phenytoin versus magnesium sulfate in preeclampsia: a pilot study.<doc-sep>A randomized clinical trial was designed to determine whether there are clinically demonstrable advantages of phenytoin over magnesium sulfate in preeclamptic patients because of the latter drug's uterine relaxant properties. An intravenous infusion, immediately after randomization, of either phenytoin or magnesium sulfate, with subsequent measurement of serum concentrations and maintenance of therapeutic levels was given to 103 preeclamptic and two eclamptic women. Observed were the rate of cervical dilation during active labor and change in hematocrit between predelivery and 24-hour postdelivery values and the incidence of side effects ascertained by interview. Compared with those receiving magnesium sulfate, patients receiving phenytoin had more rapid cervical dilation (3.3 cm/hr versus 1.5 cm/hr, p = 0.016) and a smaller fall in hematocrit after delivery (-4.7% versus -7.6%, p = 0.034). A significantly lower incidence of hot flushes (15% versus 46%, p < 0.005) and a trend toward less dyspnea and weakness were reported by phenytoin-treated patients. Our phenytoin regimen produced acceptable serum phenytoin levels (10 to 25 micrograms/ml) in 96% of patients.<doc-sep>Expectant management in severe preeclampsia: does magnesium sulfate prevent the development of eclampsia?<doc-sep>Although magnesium sulfate has been traditional or standard treatment for severe preeclampsia and eclampsia to prevent convulsions, its efficiency has always been in doubt and its induced side-effects also make it controversial for use. In this study, 64 patients, diagnosed with severe preeclampsia, were randomized into group I (34 patients) managed with MgSO4, and group II (30 patients) managed without MgSO4. There were no occurrences of eclampsia in either group. Although there was no statistical significance in the final delivery method, group I had a higher rate in cesarean section, in which most were significantly due to fetal distress (p < 0.05). Furthermore, group I had significantly more babies with poor apgar score than group II (p = 0.019). During the treatment period for those with a gestational age of less than 34 weeks, there were two patients with abruptio placentae in group I and the treatment periods were noted to be longer in group II than in group I. From the results of monitoring serum magnesium level in group I, when therapeutic level was achieved, magnesium sulfate induced great discomfort which might have led to the deterioration of the patients' condition. According to this study, magnesium sulfate's minimal efficiency, and its adverse side-effects, also make magnesium sulfate a poor choice in the management of preeclampsia. Therefore, because of our poor understanding of the etiology of preeclampsia, suitable management should be undertaken without magnesium sulfate. Improvement of the patient's pathophysiological condition or termination of pregnancy as early as possible, is recommended.<doc-sep>A comparison of magnesium sulfate and nimodipine for the prevention of eclampsia.<doc-sep>Magnesium sulfate may prevent eclampsia by reducing cerebral vasoconstriction and ischemia. Nimodipine is a calcium-channel blocker with specific cerebral vasodilator activity. Our objective was to determine whether nimodipine is more effective than magnesium sulfate for seizure prophylaxis in women with severe preeclampsia.
                We conducted an unblinded, multicenter trial in which 1650 women with severe preeclampsia were randomly assigned to receive either nimodipine (60 mg orally every 4 hours) or intravenous magnesium sulfate (given according to the institutional protocol) from enrollment until 24 hours post partum. High blood pressure was controlled with intravenous hydralazine as needed. The primary outcome measure was the development of eclampsia, as defined by a witnessed tonic-clonic seizure.
                Demographic and clinical characteristics were similar in the two groups. The women who received nimodipine were more likely to have a seizure than those who received magnesium sulfate (21 of 819 [2.6 percent] vs. 7 of 831 [0.8 percent], P=0.01). The adjusted risk ratio for eclampsia associated with nimodipine, as compared with magnesium sulfate, was 3.2 (95 percent confidence interval, 1.1 to 9.1). The antepartum seizure rates did not differ significantly between groups, but the nimodipine group had a higher rate of postpartum seizures (9 of 819 [1.1 percent] vs. 0 of 831, P=0.01). There were no significant differences in neonatal outcome between the two groups. More women in the magnesium sulfate group than in the nimodipine group needed hydralazine to control blood pressure (54.3 percent vs. 45.7 percent, P<0.001).
                Magnesium sulfate is more effective than nimodipine for prophylaxis against seizures in women with severe preeclampsia.

3,"Long-term hospitalization and beta-mimetic therapy in the treatment of intrauterine growth retardation of unknown etiology.<doc-sep>A group of 98 third trimester pregnant women whose ultrasonographic studies raised the suspicion of intrauterine fetal growth retardation was studied. The patients were randomly assigned to two groups: Group A (Treatment group: 44 patients) and Group B (Control group: 54 patients). All patients were admitted to the hospital upon diagnosis for baseline evaluation. Those in Group A remained in the hospital until delivery (mean stay 15 +/- 5 days) and received treatment with 10 mg/t.i.d. of p.o. ritodrine. Group B patients were discharged after an average stay of 7 +/- 3 days. This group was not treated with ritodrine, and they were seen weekly in an outpatient setting. The prevalence of low-birth-weight infants for their gestational age was 47.73% in the treatment group and 40.74% in the control group. Of the deliveries in the treatment group, 40.9% were induced (half for fetal indications). In the control group 35.18% of the induced labors was (47.35% for fetal indications). Of the cases in the treatment group 18.18% were delivered by cesarean section, of which 62.5% were performed for fetal distress. The control group showed similar figures: 16.66% cesarean sections with 77.7% of them done for fetal distress. We observed an incidence of 20.45% of acute fetal distress in the study group against 12.96% in the control group. Such a difference is not statistically significant. The group under study demonstrated a rate of 6.82% pathological pH value in the umbilical artery, while the rate of abnormal values in the control group was 18.52%.

4,"Treatment of acute asthma: salbutamol via jet nebuliser vs spacer and metered dose inhaler.<doc-sep>To compare the efficacy of salbutamol delivered by jet nebuliser (JN) with salbutamol via a pressurised metered dose inhaler (PMDI) and a large volume spacer (Volumatic) for management of acute asthma.
                A total of 160 children aged from 4 to 12 years presenting to an Emergency Department with acute asthma.
                The study was of multicentre (n=5) randomised, double blind, parallel design. Children weighing less than 25 kg received salbutamol 2.5 mg via the JN or 600 microg (six puffs) from the PMDI. Children over 25 kg received salbutamol 5 mg via the JN or 1200 microg (12 puffs) via the PMDI. Clinical score (range 0-12) and PEF (over 7 years) were recorded at baseline and 15, 30, 45 and 60 mins post administration.
                The improvement from baseline at 30 min in the clinical score was 1.87 for JN and 1.43 for PMDI (P=0.09) and at 60 min was 2.15 for JN and 1.12 for PMDI (P=0.0001). The improvement in PEF at 30 min was 51 L min(-1) for JN and 27 L min(-1) for PMDI (P=0.0007) and at 60 min was 57 L min(-1) for JN and 31.5 L min(-1) for PMDI (P=0.001).
                Administration of salbutamol via a PMDI and a large volume spacer device provides effective relief in the management of acute asthma in children, but to a lesser extent than a jet nebuliser. This difference may represent a dose response effect.<doc-sep>Aerosolized metaproterenol in the treatment of asthmatics with severe airflow obstruction. Comparison of two delivery methods.<doc-sep>The bronchodilator response to metaproterenol delivered by metered-dose inhaler (MDI) with a spacer device (Aerochamber [A]) and by jet nebulizer was studied in 44 asthmatic patients who presented to the emergency department with acute severe (FEV1 less than 50 percent predicted) airflow obstruction. The delivery method was randomized, double-blinded and placebo controlled. The A group received one puff of metaproterenol every five minutes for a total of three puffs (1.95 mg). The jet nebulizer group received 15 mg of metaproterenol by continuous nebulization over ten minutes. Only about 2.75 mg of the original 15 mg delivered by jet nebulizer was calculated to be available for inhalation due to the inefficiencies of the delivery system. The mean percentage of improvement in FVC and FEV1 in the A group was 33.5 and 49.0 percent, respectively. The mean percentage of improvement in FVC and FEV1 in the jet nebulizer group was 22.8 and 33.0 percent, respectively. There was no significant difference in the mean percentage of improvement values between the two groups. We were unable to demonstrate a difference in bronchodilator response to metaproterenol delivered by MDI-A and jet nebulizer in emergency department asthmatics with acute severe airflow obstruction.<doc-sep>Equivalence of continuous flow nebulizer and metered-dose inhaler with reservoir bag for treatment of acute airflow obstruction.<doc-sep>Traditionally, patients with acute airflow obstruction are treated with bronchodilator aerosols delivered by continuous flow nebulizers. While bronchodilator administration with the metered dose inhaler (MDI) and reservoir or spacer attachment is as effective as administration with the nebulizer in most settings, the former has not been widely accepted for treatment of acute airway obstruction in the emergency room. We compared the efficacy of the continuous flow nebulizer to that of the MDI with InspirEase (reservoir spacer) in 75 patients (45 men and 30 women), ages 18-73 (chi 44 years) who presented to the emergency room with acute asthma and COPD. Subjects in each group (22 COPD and 53 asthma) were randomly assigned to treatment with three puffs of metaproterenol (0.65 mg/puff) via the MDI with InspirEase plus nebulizer with placebo, or placebo MDI with InspirEase plus nebulizer with 15 mg metaproterenol in double blind fashion. Either treatment was given three times at 30 min intervals. The FEV1 and dyspnea scores according to the Borg scale were measured at baseline, 30 min after the first treatment, and 30 min after the third. There was no significant outcome difference between the two treatments in either diagnostic group. There also was no significant outcome difference for patients with baseline FEV1 less than 0.9L. Serum theophylline levels, the need for concomitant therapy with corticosteroids, or additional emergency room therapy after the study, hospitalizations and treatment side effects did not differ between treatment groups. We conclude that there is no demonstrable advantage of a continuous flow nebulizer over an MDI with InspirEase for the treatment of acute airflow obstruction.<doc-sep>Comparative efficacy of terbutaline administered by Nebuhaler and by nebulizer in young children with acute asthma.<doc-sep>We compared the use of terbutaline sulphate that was delivered by a nebulizer with its delivery by a Nebuhaler at two dose levels in 27 children (nine children per group) of between three and six years of age with acute asthma. No significant difference was found in the mean baseline clinical score among the three groups, and a significant decline occurred in the mean clinical scores in all groups by 15 minutes which was maintained to 60 minutes after the dose was administered. The decline that was achieved with delivery of the drug by way of a Nebuhaler (at either dose level) was not significantly different from that with a nebulizer, although cooperation with Nebuhaler usage was not universal in the age-group.<doc-sep>Nebuhaler versus nebuliser in children with acute asthma.<doc-sep><doc-sep>A comparison of albuterol administered by metered dose inhaler (and holding chamber) or wet nebulizer in acute asthma.<doc-sep>Comparative studies of albuterol by wet nebulizer or metered dose inhaler have tested fixed doses of medications. We compared the dose-response relationship to albuterol by wet nebulization or metered dose inhaler in acute asthma.
                Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. Patients with acute asthma received either albuterol, 0.4 mg, by metered dose inhaler (and holding chamber) or albuterol, 2.5 mg, by wet nebulizer every 30 min until maximal bronchodilation. Forty patients (forced expiratory volume in 1 s [FEV1]: 1.15 +/- 0.43 L; 36 +/- 12 percent predicted) received metered dose inhaler and 40 others (FEV1: 1.08 +/- 0.52 L; 35 +/- 16 percent predicted) received wet nebulization.
                Twenty-six patients (65 percent) receiving metered dose inhaler and 30 (75 percent) receiving wet nebulization achieved maximal bronchodilation after two doses. Almost all reached maximal bronchodilation by four doses. The FEV1 improved by 0.72 +/- 0.49 L for metered dose inhaler and 0.68 +/- 0.61 L for wet nebulizer (p = 0.71). A significant linear relationship was seen in both groups (metered dose inhaler r = 0.94; wet nebulizer r = 0.98) between the log dose of albuterol and change in FEV1. About 1/6 the wet nebulizer dose of albuterol was needed to achieve similar response to the metered dose inhaler.
                Albuterol by metered dose inhaler provided similar bronchodilation to that achieved by wet nebulization in patients with acute asthma. The cumulative dose-response technique is applicable in the emergency department setting and is helpful in comparing the relative utility of various bronchodilator regimens.<doc-sep>Efficacy and safety of a home-made non-valved spacer for bronchodilator therapy in acute asthma.<doc-sep>The aim of this study was to assess the efficacy and safety of an alternative spacer to deliver salbutamol in acute asthma. A prospective randomized study was performed with 196 patients with acute asthma, aged 4-15 y. The clinical features, oxygen saturation (SaO2) and the best of three peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR) measurements were recorded in a standardized questionnaire. Each patient received up to three conventional doses of salbutamol through an alternative home-made non-valved spacer (NVS) (500 ml mineral water plastic bottle) or an oxygen-driven nebulizer (ODN). The clinical and functional respiratory parameters (PEFR and SaO2) were assessed 15 min after each administration of the bronchodilator. In the ODN (n = 99) and NVS (n = 97) groups, PEFR (p > 0.05) and SaO2 (p > 0.05) measurements improved in all stages of the treatment. During the asthma attacks, the ODN group needed a prolonged observation in the emergency room (p = 0.000000). Side effects of salbutamol, e.g. increased heart rate, were observed in 17.2% of the patients in the ODN group and 4.1% in the NVS group (p = 0.003).
                Both devices showed comparable efficacy in mild and moderate acute attacks, but the use of the alternative NVS resulted in a shorter observation period in the emergency room. The frequency of side effects was significantly higher in the ODN group than in the NVS group.<doc-sep>High-dose albuterol by metered-dose inhaler plus a spacer device versus nebulization in preschool children with recurrent wheezing: A double-blind, randomized equivalence trial.<doc-sep>Inhaled albuterol is the most frequently used bronchodilator for acute wheezing, and nebulization is the standard mode of delivery in hospital setting. However, recent guidelines consider spacer devices as an easier to use, and cost-saving alternative and recommend the high-dose metered-dose inhaler bronchodilator.
                To demonstrate clinical equivalence between a spacer device and a nebulizer for albuterol administration.
                Randomized, double-blind, parallel group equivalence trial.
                Pediatric emergency wards at 2 tertiary teaching hospitals.
                Sixty-four 12- to 60-month-old children with acute recurrent wheezing (32 per group).
                Albuterol was administered through the spacer device (50 microg/kg) or through the nebulizer (150 microg/kg) and repeated 3 times at 20-minute intervals. Parents completed a questionnaire.
                Pulmonary index, hospitalization, ease of use, acceptability, and pulse oximetry saturation.
                The 90% confidence interval of the difference between treatment groups for the median absolute changes in pulmonary index values between T0 and T60 was [-1; +1] and was included in the equivalence interval [-1.5; +1.5]. Clinical improvement increased with time. Less than 10% of the children (3 in each group) required hospitalization (2 in each group attributable to treatment failure). Parents considered administration of albuterol using the spacer device easier (94%) and better accepted by their children (62%).
                The efficacy of albuterol administered using the spacer device was equivalent to that of the nebulizer. Given its high tolerance, repeated 50-microg/kg doses of albuterol administered through the spacer device should be considered in hospital emergency departments as first-line therapy for wheezing.<doc-sep>Wet nebulizer versus spacer and metered dose inhaler via tidal breathing.<doc-sep><doc-sep>[Bronchodilation induced by fenoterol in asthmatic patients: comparison of jet nebulization and spacer device].<doc-sep>To compare bronchodilation attained by fenoterol administered through a jet nebulizer and through a spacer device.

TREATMENT [corrected]: Group A was treated with fenoterol (2.5 mg) with saline to complete 3 ml given through a jet nebulizer; 30 minutes later, an additional dose (1 mg) was given through a 500 ml spacer.

                Fenoterol through a spacer can replace inhalation in adult asthma patients with non-severe obstruction. Lower cost and home treatment are the main advantages.<doc-sep>[Comparison of treatment of acute asthma attacks in children with salbutamol dispensed by the Volumatic dispenser or by a nebulizer].<doc-sep>Eighteen children with acute asthma were administered equal doses of Salbutamol either through a nebulizer and face mask or a dose-metered inhaler, spacer (Volumatic) and tidal breathing mechanism. Consecutive doses at twenty minute intervals were administered until either no significant improvement in pulmonary function was observed or until a cumulative dose of 0.15 mg/Kg (maximum of 5 mgs) had been given. All subjects finally received a dose of 0.15 mg/Kg (maximum of 5 mgs) of nebulized Salbutamol at the end of the study. No difference in bronchodilation was obvious between the methods of treatment. No significant side-effect was observed in any patient. Treatment of acute asthma in children with Salbutamol via a pressurized inhaler, spacer and tidal breathing mechanism may be an efficacious, safe and readily available method, but further work is needed before it can be recommended for routine home management of asthma attacks.<doc-sep>Treatment of acute severe asthma with inhaled albuterol delivered via jet nebulizer, metered dose inhaler with spacer, or dry powder.<doc-sep>Despite the increasing use of dry powder formulations in the ambulatory setting, there is a paucity of information on the efficacy of this therapeutic modality to treat acute severe asthma. In addition, studies that compared wet nebulization vs metered dose inhalers formulated with chlorofluorocarbon (CFCMDI) attached to holding chambers have yielded discrepant results. Thus, it is unclear which of the three delivery systems would elicit a superior bronchodilator response, particularly in patients with life-threatening asthma. In a prospective, randomized open design, we studied the response to inhaled albuterol (salbutamol) in 27 adult asthmatics presenting to the emergency department (ED) with an FEV1 <30% predicted. Subjects were treated with one of the following regimens (nine subjects in each group): group A, mean (SD) baseline FEV1 of 0.7 (0.2) L, received albuterol solution, 5 mg, via a nebulizer (Puritan-Bennett Raindrop; Lawrenceville, Ga) impelled with oxygen (O2) at 8 L/min; group B, baseline FEV1 of 0.6 (0.15) L, received albuterol, 400 microg, via a CFCMDI attached to a 145-mL valved aerosol holding chamber (Aerochamber; Trudell Medical; London, ON); and group C, baseline FEV1 of 0.6 (0.17) L, received albuterol powder, 400 microg, by another means (Rotahaler; Glaxo; Research Triangle Park, NC). All groups received the respective treatments on arrival in the ED, every 30 min during the first 2 h, and then hourly until the sixth hour. Clinical parameters and FEV1 were recorded on ED admission and 15 min after each dose of albuterol. At the time of ED admission, all patients also received continuous O2 and one dose of I.V. steroids (dexamethasone, 8 mg). The total dose of inhaled albuterol administered during the 6-h treatment was 45 mg of nebulized solution in group A and 3,600 microg of albuterol aerosol and dry powder in groups B and C, respectively. No significant differences were found in the population demographics, baseline FEV1, and arterial blood gas values on air. FEV1 improved significantly in all patients after the 6 h of treatment. The 6-h area under the curve FEV1 improved similarly with the three delivery methods despite differences in the total dose administered. No patient was discontinued during the trial or admitted to hospital and no evidence of cardiovascular adverse events was apparent in any of the study groups. These data support the view that the three delivery methods appear adequate to treat subjects with acute severe asthma.<doc-sep>Efficacy of albuterol administered by nebulizer versus spacer device in children with acute asthma.<doc-sep>The aim of this study was to compare the response to inhaled albuterol after administration by nebulizer with the response after administration by a metered-dose inhaler and spacer device (MDI-spacer) to children with acute asthma. In a double-blind fashion, 33 children (6 to 14 years of age) with forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) between 20% and 70% of predicted values, and who were seen in the emergency department with acute asthma, were studied. They were treated with aerosolized albuterol or placebo by MDI-spacer, followed immediately by albuterol or placebo administered by nebulizer with oxygen. The dose ratio for albuterol by MDI-spacer versus nebulizer was 1:5. Outcome measures included a clinical score, respiratory rate, arterial oxygen saturation, and FEV1, measured before and 10, 20, and 40 minutes after treatment. With the exception of heart rate (which increased in the nebulizer group and decreased in the MDI-spacer group (p < 0.05), no difference in the rate of improvement of clinical score, respiratory rate, arterial oxygen saturation, or FEV1 was noted during the 40-minute study period between children who received albuterol by nebulizer and those who received it by MDI-spacer.

This study included 150 children, 6 months and older with a history of wheeze and presenting with an acute asthma exacerbation. Children were categorized into mild, moderate and severe asthma according to medical scoring system. Children were assigned randomly into group A and B to receive standard dose of beta2-agonist (salbutamol) by MDI/AD (group A) or SVN (group B). Baseline characteristics and asthma severity were recorded. All variables (dyspnoea, use of accessory muscles, cyanosis, respiratory rate, heart rate, blood pressure, oxygen saturation, pulsus paradoxus, and wheeze) and Peak Expiratory Flow Rate (PEFR) in children 5 years and older, were determined at pre and post inhalation therapy.

                In 60 subjects with acute asthma aged between 1 to 12 years, clinical and laboratory assessment of severity at recruitment included heart rate, respiratory rate, pulsus paradoxus, arterial blood gas analysis (all cases) and peak expiratory flow rate (wherever possible). The subjects were randomized into two equal groups to receive aerosolized salbutamol either via nebulizer (Group I) or MDI-spacer (Group II) as per the Consensus Guidelines. The response to therapy was sequentially assessed after 20, 40 and 60 minutes of institution of therapy.
                A significantly (p < 0.02) greater number of subjects in Group II presented with severe dyspnea and intercostal muscle retraction (subjective assessment). However, the objectively evaluable outcome parameters were comparable (p > 0.05) in both groups at presentation. All the outcome measures showed a significant (p < 0.05) improvement with time in both the groups. The recovery parameters were comparable (p > 0.05) at different time periods in the two groups.
                MDI-spacer is as effective as a nebulizer for the aerosolized administration of salbutamol in an acute exacerbation of asthma in children. However, for developing countries, distinct advantages (economic and power requirement) argue strongly for utilization of MDI-spacer in preference to nebulizer.<doc-sep>[Different inhaler devices in acute asthma attacks: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study].<doc-sep>To verify the efficacy, side effects, and cost of treatment of acute asthma attacks, using different inhaler devices.
                This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. Salbutamol was administered via a nebulizer, a metered-dose inhaler (attached to a commercially available spacer device), a homemade non-valved spacer device, or a dry powder inhaler. Assessments were made at zero, 20, 40 and 60 minutes, followed by the application of salbutamol and placebo with another device. Forty children (mean age of 11+/-3.5 years) with acute asthma attacks, were evaluated. Clinical score, forced expiratory volume in one second and side effects were analyzed. The costs for medication and spacer devices were calculated.
                There is no difference between groups regarding clinical score and variation of forced expiratory volume in one second. There was a major variation in the heart rate response to the nebulizer (35%) compared to the commercially available spacer and dry powder inhaler (15 and 17%) and between the homemade spacer and the commercially available spacer (28 and 15%) (p = 0.004). The nebulizer and homemade spacer caused more tremor (p = 0.02). The cost of treatment was higher for the nebulizer and commercially available spacer (p = 0.0001).
                The nebulizer was more expensive and used more medicine, showing the same efficiency. The homemade spacer was cheaper, but presented more side effects. The commercially available spacer was as expensive as the nebulizer, although safer. The dry powder inhaler was cheaper, but, just as the homemade spacer, it also caused tachycardia.<doc-sep>Salbutamol treatment of acute severe asthma in the ED: MDI versus hand-held nebulizer.<doc-sep>The objectives of this study were to compare the efficacy of salbutamol delivered by either metered-dose inhaler plus spacer (MDI-spacer) or by wet nebulization (NEB), and to determine the relationships between physiologic responses and plasma salbutamol concentrations. Asthmatic patients presenting to the emergency department (ED) with acute severe asthma (forced expiratory volume in the first second [FEV1] less than 50% of predicted) were enrolled in a randomized, double-blind, parallel-group study. The MDI-spacer group received salbutamol, delivered via MDI into a spacer device, in four puffs actuated in rapid succession at 10-minute intervals (2.4 mg/h). The NEB group was treated with nebulized salbutamol, 1.5 mg, via nebulizer at 15-minute intervals (6 mg/h). Doses were calculated on the basis of the percentage of total dose that reaches the lower airway with both methods. The protocol involved 3 hours of this treatment. Mean peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR) and FEV1 improved significantly over baseline values for both groups (P=.01). However, there were no significant differences between both groups for PEFR and FEV1 at any point studied. The examination of the relationships between cumulative dose of salbutamol and change in FEV1 showed a significant linear relationship (P=.01) for both methods (MDI r=.97; NEB r=.97). The regression equations showed that for every 1 mg of salbutamol by MDI-spacer, 2.5 mg are needed from nebulization to have equal therapeutic response. At the end of treatment, the salbutamol plasma levels were 10.1+/-1.6 ng/ml for the MDI-spacer group and 14.4+/-2.3 ng/ml for the NEB group (P=.0003). Both groups showed a nonsignificant heart rate decrease. A significant group-by-time interaction means that differences between groups increased with time (P=.04). Additionally, the NEB group presented a higher incidence of tremor (P=.03) and anxiety (P=.04), reflecting larger systemic absorption of salbutamol. These data indicate that when doses used are calculated on the basis of the percentage of total drug that reaches the lower airway, there was equivalent bronchodilatation after salbutamol administered by either MDI-spacer or nebulization in patients with acute severe asthma. However, nebulizer therapy produced greater side effects related to the increase in salbutamol absorption and higher plasma level.<doc-sep>Comparison of beta-adrenergic agents delivered by nebulizer vs metered dose inhaler with InspirEase in hospitalized asthmatic patients.<doc-sep>The present study was undertaken to determine if beta-agonists delivered by nebulizer provide better clinical responses than MDI therapy in status asthmaticus. We divided 28 hospitalized asthmatic patients into three groups. Group 1 received albuterol by MDI with InspirEase. Group 2 received nebulized albuterol. Group 3 received nebulized metaproterenol. Both nebulizer regimens resulted in significant improvements in both FVC and FEV1 by 30 min after initial hospital beta-agonist treatment. No significant improvement was noted in initial spirometry in the MDI with InspirEase group. In spite of the superiority of nebulizer therapy in the initial phase of hospitalization, the daily rates of spirometric improvement and duration of hospitalization were not significantly different among the three groups. Our results indicate that nebulizer therapy provides superior spirometric improvement in the initial phase of status asthmaticus. However, both MDI and nebulizer regimens provided similar rates of spirometric improvement and duration of hospitalization.<doc-sep>Delivery of albuterol in a pediatric emergency department.<doc-sep>To determine if albuterol delivery by the combination of a metered-dose inhaler (MDI) with a spacer is equal in effectiveness to nebulization in a pediatric emergency department setting.

                Urban children's hospital emergency department.
                Patients > or = six years of age with the diagnosis of acute asthma exacerbation. Exclusion criteria consisted of impending respiratory failure and corticosteroid administration within the preceding seven days.
                Patients were randomized into either the nebulizer treatment group or one of two MDI-spacer treatment groups (two spacers were evaluated). Each patient received three albuterol treatments administered evenly over one hour. The dose ratio for albuterol by nebulizer versus MDI-spacer was 6.9:1. Outcome was assessed by comparing the pre- and posttreatment percent predicted respiratory rate and percent predicted peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR) for each patient.
                Sixty patients were enrolled in the study. All three treatment groups showed significant improvement following albuterol therapy in both percent predicted respiratory rate and percent predicted PEFR. When comparing the three groups against each other in regard to outcome, no significant differences were found in improvement of percent predicted respiratory rate (P = 0.3258) or percent predicted PEFR (P = 0.9362).

                A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled intervention study conducted at two sites.
                The EDs of a large municipal hospital and a university teaching hospital.
                Thirty-five patients 10 to 45 years of age seeking treatment at an ED for acute asthma.
                Patients were randomly assigned to receive either albuterol by nebulizer plus placebo by inhaler (n = 20) or albuterol by inhaler plus placebo by nebulizer (n = 15). The dose was repeated every 30 min until the FEV1 was at least 80 percent of predicted, the patient became asymptomatic, or 6 doses had been given.
                All references in this article to spirometric measurements of forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1), forced vital capacity (FVC), and peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR) represent percentages of the predicted normal value. No significant (p > 0.58) differences occurred in baseline mean FEV1, FVC, or PEFR for the two groups. For both groups, significant improvement occurred in mean FEV1 at 30 min (p < 0.02) and at 60 min (p < 0.02), and in maximum mean FEV1 (p < 0.001). However, no significant (p > 0.6) differences occurred between groups in mean FEV1, FVC, or PEFR at 30 and 60 min, or in maximum improvement attained. The sample size was sufficiently large to detect a 12 percent difference in improvement with a power of 90 percent. Thirty-three of 35 patients were treated successfully with the study protocol, became asymptomatic, and were discharged home. One patient from each group required further treatment.
                There was no detectable difference in effectiveness of albuterol administered by nebulizer or the inhaler system for treatment of acute asthma. There was no detectable difference in effectiveness of albuterol administered by nebulizer or the inhaler system for the treatment of acute asthma when the dose was titrated to clinical response. When compared with nebulizer, the metered-dose inhaler with holding chamber delivers a full dose of albuterol more quickly and at no higher cost.<doc-sep>Costs and effectiveness of spacer versus nebulizer in young children with moderate and severe acute asthma.<doc-sep>To compare the costs and effectiveness of albuterol by metered dose inhaler (MDI) and spacer versus nebulizer in young children with moderate and severe acute asthma.
                Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in an emergency department at a children's hospital. The participants were children 1 to 4 years of age with moderate to severe acute asthma. Patients assigned to the spacer group received albuterol (600 microg) by MDI by spacer (AeroChamber) followed by placebo by nebulizer (n = 30). The nebulizer group received placebo MDI by spacer followed by 2.5 mg albuterol by nebulizer (n = 30). Treatments were repeated at 20-minute intervals until the patient was judged to need no further doses of bronchodilator, or a total of 6 treatments.
                Clinical score, heart rate, respiratory rate, auscultatory findings, and oxygen saturation were recorded at baseline, after each treatment, and 60 minutes after the last treatment. Baseline characteristics and asthma severity were similar for the treatment groups. The spacer was as effective as the nebulizer for clinical score, respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation but produced a greater reduction in wheezing (P =.03). Heart rate increased to a greater degree in the nebulizer group (11.0/min vs 0.17/min for spacer, P <.01). Fewer children in the spacer group required admission (33% vs 60% in the nebulizer group, P =.04, adjusted for sex). No differences were seen in rates of tremor or hyperactivity. The mean cost of each emergency department presentation was NZ$825 for the spacer group and NZ$1282 for the nebulizer group (P =.03); 86% of children and 85% of parents preferred the spacer.
                The MDI and spacer combination was a cost-effective alternative to a nebulizer in the delivery of albuterol to young children with moderate and severe acute asthma.<doc-sep>Metered dose inhaler and nebuliser in acute asthma.<doc-sep>One hundred and eleven children with acute asthma were studied to compare delivery of terbutaline by either a metered dose inhaler (MDI) with a valved holding chamber or a nebuliser driven by air. Eligible patients were randomised; the MDI group received three puffs (0.75 mg) of terbutaline and the nebuliser group received 2 ml (5.0 mg) terbutaline solution diluted with 2 ml 0.9% saline for inhalation over 10 minutes. Patients were evaluated by spirometry, pulse oximetry, and clinical severity scoring system at baseline and again 15 minutes after the beginning of treatment. The baseline data of the two groups were not significantly different. All parameters of spirometry, except the peak expiratory flow (PEF) for the nebuliser group, and clinical severity score for both groups significantly improved after terbutaline treatment. Compared with the nebuliser group, the MDI group after treatment had better mean (SD) oxygen saturation (SaO2; 96.82 (1.63)% v 95.44 (1.88)%), frequency of oxygen desaturation (23.2% v 47.3%), absolute increase of PEF (32.6 (37.7) l/min v 10.2 (34.7) l/min), and SaO2 (0.54 (1.64)% v -0.47 (1.84)%). There was also a mean (SD) per cent increase of forced expiratory volume in one second (22.9 (21.0)% v 15.4 (16.1)%), PEF (27.7 (38.4)%) v 7.7 (25.1)%), and SaO2 (0.58 (1.72)% v -0.47 (1.93)%). In conclusion, aerosol treatment by MDI (with a valved holding chamber) in this study proved to be superior to nebuliser treatment in terms of SaO2 and some measurements of spirometry. Respiratory therapists working with children with severe asthma should be aware of the possibility of oxygen desaturation, especially when using room air as the driving gas for nebulisation.<doc-sep>Metered-dose inhalers with spacers vs nebulizers for pediatric asthma.<doc-sep>To determine whether the administration of beta-agonists by metered-dose inhaler (MDI) with a spacer device is as effective as the administration of beta-agonists by nebulizer for the treatment of acute asthma exacerbations in children.
                Randomized trial with two arms.
                Urban pediatric emergency department (ED) in Bronx, NY.
                Convenience sample of 152 children 2 years and older with a history of at least two episodes of wheezing presenting to the ED with an acute asthma exacerbation.
                Patients were randomly assigned to receive standard doses of a beta-agonist (albuterol) by an MDI with spacer or by a nebulizer. Dosing intervals and the use of other medications were determined by the treating physician.
                Baseline characteristics and asthma history were recorded. Asthma severity score, peak expiratory flow rate in children 5 years or older, and oxygen saturation were determined at presentation and before admission or discharge. The groups did not differ in age, sex, ethnicity, age of onset of asthma, or asthma severity score at presentation. There were no significant differences between the groups in outcomes, including mean changes in respiratory rate, asthma severity score, and peak expiratory flow rate, oxygen saturation, number of treatments given, administration of steroids in the ED, and admission rate. Patients given MDIs with spacers required shorter treatment times in the ED (66 minutes vs 103 minutes, P < .001). Fewer patients in the spacer group had episodes of vomiting in the ED (9% vs 20%, P < .04), and patients in the nebulizer group had a significantly greater mean percent increase in heart rate from baseline to final disposition (15% vs 5%, P < .001).
                These data suggest that MDIs with spacers may be an effective alternative to nebulizers for the treatment of children with acute asthma exacerbations in the ED.<doc-sep>A randomised controlled trial to assess the relative benefits of large volume spacers and nebulisers to treat acute asthma in hospital.<doc-sep>To compare the clinical effectiveness, acceptability, and cost benefit of administering beta2 agonists by means of a metered dose inhaler and large volume spacer with conventional nebulisers to children admitted to hospital with acute asthma.
                A randomised controlled trial was conducted over five months. Sixty one children older than 3 years admitted to a large teaching hospital and a district general hospital with acute asthma completed the study. Children received either 5 mg of salbutamol up to one hourly by jet nebuliser, or up to 10 puffs of salbutamol 100 microg by means of a metered dose inhaler and spacer up to one hourly.
                Median hospital stay was 40 hours in the nebuliser group and 36.5 hours in the spacer group. Asthma disability scores at two weeks after discharge were significantly improved in the spacer group. Drug costs were pound 14.62 less for each patient in the spacer group.
                Large volume spacers are an acceptable, cost effective alternative to nebulisers in treating children admitted with acute asthma, provided that the children can use the mouthpiece, and symptoms are not severe. Their use facilitates effective home treatment by parents, with subsequent reduction in morbidity and re-admission rates.<doc-sep>",,There is insufficient evidence to determine whether the use of a nebulizer is superior to a combination of inhaled and metered dose inhalers in the treatment of acute asthma.,CD000052
5,"Schizophrenia: a study comparing a family therapy group following a paradoxical model plus psychodrugs and a group treated by the conventional clinical approach.<doc-sep>A 'short family therapy' in schizophrenia, according to a specific systemic model (the 'Elementary Pragmatic Model' or EPM) with a strong paradoxical structure is presented. A total of 38 schizophrenic patients, randomly allocated, were treated according to the EPM model combined with psychotropic drugs (19 cases, each of whom underwent 10 weekly sessions of family therapy) or a traditional clinical-pharmacological approach (19 cases). With regard to all measures (number of drop-outs, symptoms according to the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale, social activity according to the Strauss-Carpenter Outcome Scale and an interactive test) the EPM group showed better results. It is suggested that the systemic approach could be used not only as an effective therapy model in schizophrenia but also as an intervention in addition to or integrated into an ongoing psychoeducational family therapy.<doc-sep>Randomized controlled trial of motivational interviewing, cognitive behavior therapy, and family intervention for patients with comorbid schizophrenia and substance use disorders.<doc-sep>Comorbidity of substance abuse disorders with schizophrenia is associated with a greater risk for serious illness complications and poorer outcome. Methodologically sound studies investigating treatment approaches for patients with these disorders are rare, although recommendations for integrated and comprehensive treatment programs abound. This study investigates the relative benefit of adding an integrated psychological and psychosocial treatment program to routine psychiatric care for patients with schizophrenia and substance use disorders.
                The authors conducted a randomized, single-blind controlled comparison of routine care with a program of routine care integrated with motivational interviewing, cognitive behavior therapy, and family or caregiver intervention.
                The integrated treatment program resulted in significantly greater improvement in patients' general functioning than routine care alone at the end of treatment and 12 months after the beginning of the study. Other benefits of the program included a reduction in positive symptoms and in symptom exacerbations and an increase in the percent of days of abstinence from drugs or alcohol over the 12-month period from baseline to follow-up.
                These findings demonstrate the effectiveness of a program of routine care integrated with motivational interviewing, cognitive behavior therapy, and family intervention over routine psychiatric care alone for patients with comorbid schizophrenia and alcohol or drug abuse or dependence.<doc-sep>The impact of therapeutic relatives' groups on the course of illness of schizophrenic patients.<doc-sep>This study considers the question of whether relapse rates among schizophrenic patients can be reduced by means of relatives' groups. In a randomized, controlled intervention study, two therapeutic strategies (therapeutic relatives' groups, initiated relatives' self-help groups) were compared with each other and with a control group. Interventions were confined to the relatives, with the patients continuing their standard treatment. The study involved 151 relatives of 99 chronic DSMIII schizophrenics. Data were collected before and after a 1-year intervention phase and in a 2-year follow-up. No difference existed between the groups with respect to rehospitalization data. However, numerous differences recorded in the psychopathological findings and in living and working circumstances suggest that therapeutic work with relatives is of clinically significant benefit.<doc-sep>Educating relatives about schizophrenia.<doc-sep>An education program, which was part of a controlled trial of intervention with families of schizophrenic patients, is described and evaluated.

The particular foci were on themes that arose during sessions, principal therapeutic interventions offered, and caveats for counselors working in the field. The most striking finding was the diverse range of themes, covering personal, coping, family, and social aspects of the caregiving experience. This required a correspondingly broad array of interventions. The implications are clear: confining counseling for caregivers to such traditional dimensions as education or attempts to reduce emotional expressiveness denies them the opportunity to deal with other equally relevant concerns.<doc-sep>Family psychoeducational support groups in schizophrenia.<doc-sep>Family members of 55 patients with schizophrenia were randomly assigned to a psychoeducational support group or to a control group.

Thirty-six schizophrenic patients living in high Expressed Emotion (EE) parental households were randomly allocated to an intervention or control group. The parents of patients allocated to the intervention were offered ten weekly sessions of counselling. The patient was not included in these sessions. Patients in both groups received standard after-care of medication and support. Relapses in the intervention group, although fewer, were not significantly different from the control group. Given the impressive evidence in favour of family interventions in reducing relapse rates in schizophrenic patients possible reasons for this result are discussed. Aspects of the intervention described here, exclusion of the patient, no control over the patients' medication or involvement with their management, short duration of intervention and lack of individual assessment, could explain this finding. This negative result is important in indicating what factors should be included in an effective psychosocial intervention.<doc-sep>Three-year trials of personal therapy among schizophrenic patients living with or independent of family, I: Description of study and effects on relapse rates.<doc-sep>The study of individual psychotherapeutic approaches to the treatment of schizophrenia has yielded equivocal findings, partly because of methodologic problems. Further, the ability of psychosocial treatments to prevent psychotic relapse appears to lessen over time. The authors' goal was to develop and test a demonstrably effective individual therapy for schizophrenia.
                Using a study design that addressed previous methodologic issues, the authors evaluated personal therapy specifically designed to forestall late relapse in patients with schizophrenia. They evaluated the effectiveness of personal therapy over a period of 3 years after hospital discharge among 151 patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder diagnosed according to Research Diagnostic Criteria. The patients were randomly assigned to receive either personal therapy or contrasting therapies in one of two concurrent trials. One trial studied patients who were living with family (N = 97); the other studied patients who were living independent of family (N = 54).
                All of the patients had extensive psychiatric histories, but only 44 (29%) experienced recurrent psychotic episodes over the 3-year study period, and only 27 (18%) prematurely terminated the study; most of those who left the study were in the no-personal-therapy conditions. Among patients living with family, personal therapy was more effective than family and supportive therapies in preventing psychotic and affective relapse as well as noncompliance. However, among patients living independent of family, those who received personal therapy had significantly more psychotic decompensations than did those who received supportive therapy.
                Personal therapy had a positive effect on adverse outcomes among patients who lived with family. However, personal therapy increased the rate of psychotic relapse for patients living independent of family. The application of personal therapy might best be delayed until patients have achieved symptom and residential stability.<doc-sep>Patient functioning and family burden in a controlled, real-world trial of family psychoeducation for schizophrenia.<doc-sep>This study explored the effectiveness of a psychoeducational family intervention for schizophrenia on patients' personal and social functioning as well as on relatives' burden and perceived support.
                Thirty-four mental health professionals from 17 public mental health centers in Italy selected 71 families of consumers with schizophrenia. Forty-two families were randomly assigned to a group that received the intervention for six months, and 29 families were assigned to a waiting list for six months. At baseline and six months later, validated tools were used to assess patients' clinical status, personal and social functioning, and social network as well as relatives' burden, social resources, and perception of professional support.
                In the intervention group the number of patients with poor or very poor global personal and social functioning decreased significantly, from 17 (47 percent) at baseline to nine (25 percent) at follow-up. A significant improvement was found for the intervention group in patients' social relationships, interests in obtaining a job, maintenance of social interests, and management of social conflicts. Twenty-seven patients (74 percent) reported that their social relationships had improved during the six-month period. For both the intervention and control groups, family burden significantly improved. Relatives' social contacts and perception of professional support significantly increased only in the intervention group.
                The results suggest that a psychoeducational family intervention may have a significant impact on functional outcomes of schizophrenia when provided to patients and caregivers in real-world settings.<doc-sep>A trial of family therapy v. a relatives group for schizophrenia.<doc-sep>Schizophrenic patients living in high contact with relatives having high expressed emotion (EE) were recruited for a trial of social interventions. The patients were maintained on neuroleptic medication, while their families were randomly assigned to education plus family therapy or education plus a relatives group. Eleven out of 12 families accepted family therapy in the home, whereas only six out of 11 families were compliant with the relatives group. Non-compliance was associated with a poorer outcome for the patients in terms of the relapse rate. The relapse rate over nine months in the family therapy stream was 8%, while that in compliant families in the relatives group stream was 17%. Patients' social functioning showed small, non-significant, gains. The data from the current trial were compared with data from a previous trial. The lowering of the relapse rate in schizophrenia appears to be mediated by reductions in relatives' EE and/or face-to-face contact, and is not explained by better compliance with medication. Reduction in EE and/or contact was associated with a minuscule relapse rate (5%). Very little change occurred in families who were non-compliant with the relatives group. On the basis of these findings, we recommend that the most cost-effective procedure is to establish relatives groups in conjunction with family education and one or more initial family therapy sessions in the home. It is particularly important to offer home visits to families who are unable to or refuse to attend the relatives groups.<doc-sep>The community management of schizophrenia. A controlled trial of a behavioural intervention with families to reduce relapse.<doc-sep>Schizophrenic patients were recruited into a trial of a prophylactic behavioural intervention with families. Families with at least one high Expressed Emotion (EE) relative were randomly allocated to one of four intervention groups: Behavioural Intervention Enactive; Behavioural Intervention Symbolic; Education Only; Routine Treatment. Patients from low-EE families were randomly allocated to two groups: Education Only or Routine Treatment. Relapse rates over nine months after discharge were significantly lower for patients in the two Behavioural Intervention, compared with Education Only and Routine Treatment groups. There was little difference between the two low-EE groups. Patients returning to high-EE relatives showed significantly higher relapse rates than those returning to low-EE relatives, in groups not receiving active intervention. Changes from high to low EE occurred in the Behavioural Intervention groups, and similar although less extensive changes occurred in the Education Only and Routine Treatment groups. Changes in criticism and marked emotional over-involvement (EOI) occurred generally in high-EE groups but were larger in magnitude in the Enactive and Symbolic groups. Reduction of hostility only occurred in the Behavioural Intervention groups. These results give partial support for the causal role of EE in relapse. There were no significant differences between the groups with respect to contact with the psychiatric services or medication.<doc-sep>Family treatment for schizophrenia : the design and research application of therapist training models.<doc-sep>The NIMH Treatment Strategies in Schizophrenia (TSS) collaborative study group investigated the efficacy of antisychotic drug maintenance strategies involving reduced medication exposure in interaction with applied and supportive family management for the long-term treatment of schizophrenia.

They were trained by two of the authors, I.R.H.F and C.W.M, in applied family management, a homebased treatment derived from the behavioral family therapy developed by them. Clinicians' characteristics, selection, and training methods, as well as patient rehospitalization rates, are reported for the two family management conditions.

                Relatives were randomly provided with an informative programme (n = 50), or allocated to receive an additional support programme (n = 26). Patients did not attend the programme to overcome cultural and organizational implementation barriers. The 12 and 24 months clinical and family outcomes were assessed.
                Patients' compliance with standard care was greater at 12 months in the more intensive behavioural management group over a control group receiving treatment as usual (TAU) (n = 25). A reduction in levels of expressed emotion (EE), significantly more frequent in those receiving the additional support programme than just the informative, occurred after treatment completion. Other clinical and family outcomes did not differ. However, treatment benefits declined at 24 months, when baseline high EE was again predictive of patient's admission and relatives were more vulnerable to objective burden. Baseline illness severity variables predicted a number of medium and long-term poor clinical outcomes.
                Although family psychoeducation has been tested in a wide range of Anglo-Saxon settings, there remains need to assess outcomes more internationally. Effective family interventions for people with schizophrenia probably require continued administration of key-elements or ongoing informal support to deal with the vicissitudes of illnesses.<doc-sep>Multiple-family group treatment for English- and Vietnamese-speaking families living with schizophrenia.<doc-sep>This study, which was the first evaluation in Australia of multiple-family group treatment, explored the effectiveness of this approach for a newly arrived non-English speaking migrant group, first-generation Vietnamese families, and for English-speaking families.
                Thirty-four pairs of English-speaking consumers and family members and 25 Vietnamese-speaking pairs were randomly assigned to a multiple-family group or a control group. All consumers had a diagnosis of schizophrenia. The multiple-family group intervention (26 sessions over 12 months) was delivered as an adjunct to case management services, which all consumers received. Outcomes, which were measured immediately after treatment and 18 months later, included the number of relapse episodes; the presence and severity of symptoms, as measured by the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) and the Scale for the Assessment of Negative Symptoms; and social functioning, as measured by the Family Burden Scale, the Health of the Nation Outcome Scale, and the Quality of Life Scale.
                Relapse rates immediately after treatment were significantly lower for the multiple-family group than for the control group (12 and 36 percent), and relapse rates were also lower during the follow-up period (25 and 63 percent). BPRS ratings were significantly lower for participants in the multiple-family group, and vocational outcomes also improved. The reductions in relapse and symptoms were similar for the English-speaking and the Vietnamese-speaking family groups; sample size precluded statistical analysis of differences.
                Multiple-family group treatment is an effective cognitive-behavioral intervention in the treatment of schizophrenia. The findings suggest continued application of and research on family interventions for non-English speaking migrant populations.<doc-sep>Family-based intervention for schizophrenic patients in China. A randomised controlled trial.<doc-sep>We developed and evaluated a comprehensive, ongoing intervention for families of schizophrenic patients appropriate for China's complex family relationships and unique social environment.
                Sixty-three DSM-III-R schizophrenic patients living with family members were enrolled when admitted to hospital and randomly assigned to receive standard care or a family-based intervention that included monthly 45-minute counselling sessions focused on the management of social and occupational problems, medication management, family education, family group meetings, and crisis intervention.
                At 6, 12, and 18-month follow-ups by blind evaluators, the proportion of subjects rehospitalised was lower, the duration of rehospitalisation was shorter, and the duration of employment was longer in the experimental group than in the control group; these differences were statistically significant at the 12 and 18-month follow-ups and were not explained by differences in drug compliance. Family intervention was associated with significantly lower levels of family burden.
                This intervention is less costly than standard treatment, is suitable for urban families of schizophrenic patients in China and feasible given the constraints of the Chinese mental health system.<doc-sep>A randomized controlled trial of a mutual support group for family caregivers of patients with schizophrenia.<doc-sep>This randomized controlled trial examined the effectiveness of a 12-session mutual support group conducted over 3-months for Chinese family caregivers of a relative with schizophrenia compared with routine family support services in Hong Kong. Forty-eight family caregivers from two psychiatric outpatient clinics were allocated randomly to an experimental (mutual support and usual outpatient care) group (n = 24) or a control (usual outpatient care only) group (n = 24). Data were collected prior to, 1 week and 3 months after the intervention. Families allocated to the mutual support group experienced decreased levels of family burden and increased family functioning and these changes were significantly greater than those of the controls at both post-intervention time points. The experimental group also showed a significant decrease in the duration of patient re-hospitalization (the total number of days of psychiatric hospitalization) at 3 months compared with the control group. This suggests that the mutual support group provided a more responsive service for patients than standard care. However, there was no significant difference in family service utilization between the two groups. The findings indicate that a mutual support group can provide benefits for family caregivers of people with schizophrenia that go beyond those provided by routine family support.

                A total of 106 outpatients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder who were receiving services from a large community mental health center were randomly assigned to receive standard care or standard care plus multiple-family group treatment. The two-year multiple-family intervention consisted of weekly group sessions designed to educate patients and their family members about the biological basis of mental illness and treatment, to improve illness management and coping skills, and to provide social support. The group sessions were conducted by two clinicians using a standardized protocol. Each multiple-family group included five to eight families and consumers. Service records for the year before and after random assignment to the study groups were examined in an intent-to-treat analysis.
                During the year after random assignment to study groups, multiple-family group treatment was associated with a lower rate of psychiatric hospitalization than standard care. It was only marginally associated with lower use of crisis services, and it was not associated with the amount of outpatient service time.
                The findings suggest that implementation of multiple-family group treatment in a capitated community mental health setting improves hospitalization outcomes without increasing the overall volume of outpatient mental health services.<doc-sep>An exploratory randomised controlled trial of a support programme for carers of patients with a psychosis.<doc-sep>Despite an acknowledgement of the impact of serious mental disorders on informal caregivers, we still know little about how to best help them. The aim of the study was to evaluate the effectiveness of a two-phased carers' intervention comprising family sessions followed by relatives' groups. This intervention was designed to be of 'intermediate' intensity, that is,one lying between brief educational programmes and long-term family psychoeducational treatments.
                An exploratory randomised controlled trial was conducted comparing the experimental support programme with 'standard' care. All carers of patients with a psychotic disorder from a defined population were approached. Outcome measures were based on a 'stress-appraisal-coping' model of caregiving.
                Despite concerted attempts to engage carers, only 42% participated in the study. The carers' programme did not offer any significant advantage on any of the outcome measures: psychological morbidity, negative appraisal, coping or social support. The severity of caregiving difficulties decreased over the study period for the group as a whole.
                There is still uncertainty about the most effective interventions for carers. Meeting 'needs' may not improve caregiver distress.<doc-sep>A randomized controlled trial of a brief intervention for families of patients with a first episode of psychosis.<doc-sep>Carers' satisfaction with psychiatric services related to information and advice is generally poor. This may be particularly true for services trying to meet the needs of ethnically diverse communities. It is important that services attempt to ameliorate carers' concerns as early as possible. The authors aimed to assess the impact of a brief educational and advice support service on carers of patients with a first episode of psychotic illness.
                Carers of all patients identified with a first episode of psychosis in a defined psychiatric catchment area of North London were invited to participate. Following consent from patients and relatives, relatives were randomly allocated to receive (in addition to usual services) a brief intervention comprising education and advice about the disorder from a support team or to usual care from community psychiatric services.
                One hundred and six carers were recruited to the study. Take-up of the intervention was less than expected and the intervention had little impact. The authors found no differences over time between the randomized arms for relatives' satisfaction (F = 23, p = 0 .4, df = 1) or number of days spent by patients in hospital over nine months from entry to the trial (F= 1.7, p= 0.18, df = 1).
                It was found that the support and advice intervention for families had little impact on their satisfaction or on patients' outcomes. However, failure to take up the intervention threatens the conclusions as the power to show an effect was reduced. Although family interventions, in general, are considered an important adjunct to the treatment of patients with chronic psychosis, there may be difficulties in providing an educational and support intervention shortly after first onset. How and when psychiatric services provide information and advice to carers of people newly diagnosed with a psychosis requires further study.<doc-sep>A program for relapse prevention in schizophrenia: a controlled study.<doc-sep>This study examined whether a program for relapse prevention (PRP) is more effective than treatment as usual (TAU) in reducing relapse and rehospitalization rates among outpatients with schizophrenia.
                Eighty-two outpatients with DSM-III-R schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder were randomly assigned to receive either PRP (experimental group, n = 41) or TAU (control group, n = 41) and were followed up for an 18-month prospective controlled study. Patients in both groups were prescribed standard doses of maintenance antipsychotic medication. Treatment with PRP consisted of a combination of psychoeducation, active monitoring for prodromal symptoms with clinical intervention when such symptoms occurred, weekly group therapy for patients, and multifamily groups. The TAU consisted of biweekly individual supportive therapy and medication management.
                Outcome rates over 18 months were 17% for relapse (7 patients) and 22% for rehospitalization (9 patients) in the PRP group, compared with 34% for relapse (14 patients) and 39% for rehospitalization (16 patients) in the TAU group (P = .01 and P = .03, respectively). Addition of age, sex, baseline Global Assessment Scale score, Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale scores (3 measures), and substance abuse to the proportional hazards regression models all yielded nonsignificant effects. The PRP teams were much more likely than the TAU psychiatrists to identify prodromal episodes before patients met objective relapse criteria or needed hospitalization.
                The PRP was effective in detecting prodromal symptoms of relapse early in an episode. Crisis intervention including increased antipsychotic medication use during the prodromal phase reduced relapse and rehospitalization rates.<doc-sep>Patient and relative education in community psychiatry: a randomized controlled trial regarding its effectiveness.<doc-sep>Family psychoeducation has a well-documented effect on the short-term prognosis in schizophrenia. Less is known about the effectiveness of shorter programmes with the main focus on information for patients (patient education) or for patients and relatives (family education).
                A randomized study of the effectiveness of an eight-session psychoeducational programme for patients with schizophrenia and for their relatives was conducted in two community mental health centres, in Arhus and Viborg (Denmark). Patient outcome measures were knowledge, relapse, compliance, insight and satisfaction, and relative outcome measures were knowledge and satisfaction. Post-intervention outcome and follow-up evaluation 1 year after the start of the intervention are presented.
                A statistically significant increase in knowledge of schizophrenia in both relatives and patients was demonstrated at postintervention and a non-significant trend at 1-year follow-up. Statistically significant changes in the Verona Service Satisfaction Scale Scores in the subdimension of satisfaction with Relatives involvement were demonstrated both for patients and relatives postintervention and for patients at 1-year follow-up. There was a tendency that time-to-relapse increased in the intervention group at postintervention and that the schizophrenia subscore of the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale was reduced in the intervention group at 1-year follow-up. No differences were found between the groups regarding compliance, insight into psychosis, psychosocial function (General Assessment of Function) or in relatives' expressed emotion scores postintervention or at 1-year follow-up.
                A short patient and relative education programme seems to be able to influence knowledge and some aspects of satisfaction, but does not seem to be sufficient to influence important variables such as relapse, compliance, psychopathology, insight or psychosocial functioning.<doc-sep>Parental affective style and the treatment of schizophrenia. Predicting course of illness and social functioning.<doc-sep>In a randomized controlled study, the affective style (AS) of parents of schizophrenics in clinic-based individual treatment groups and home-based family treatment groups was compared prior to treatment and again three months after treatment had begun. Affective style is an index reflecting the quality of the family emotional climate, measured from face-to-face discussion. Pretherapy and posttherapy measures of negative AS were significantly predictive of relapse within the nine-month treatment period for patients in individual treatment. In addition, for both treatment groups, a negative AS pattern at the posttherapy reassessment was significantly associated with decreased patient social functioning, reduced ability of the family to absorb the family intervention, and lower capacity of the family to cope with everyday family stresses. The results suggest that AS is an important intrafamilial attribute, with implications for treatment strategy and planning.<doc-sep>Multiple-family groups and psychoeducation in the treatment of schizophrenia.<doc-sep>To compare outcomes in psychoeducational multiple-family group treatment vs psychoeducational single-family treatment.
                A total of 172 acutely psychotic patients, aged 18 to 45 years, with DSM-III-R schizophrenic disorders were randomly assigned to single- or multiple-family psychoeducational treatment at six public hospitals in the state of New York. Psychotic relapse, symptom status, medication compliance, rehospitalization, and employment were assessed independently during 2 years of supervised treatment.
                The multiple-family groups yielded significantly lower 2-year cumulative relapse rates than did the single-family modality (16% vs 27%) and achieved markedly lower rates in patients whose conditions had not remitted at index hospital discharge (13% vs 33%). The relapse hazard ratio between treatments was 1:3. The relapse rate for both modalities was less than half the expected rate (65% to 80% for 2 years) for patients receiving individual treatment and medication. Rehospitalization rates and psychotic symptoms decreased significantly, and medication compliance was high, to an equal degree in both modalities.
                Psychoeducational multiple-family groups were more effective than single-family treatment in extending remission, especially in patients at higher risk for relapse, with a cost-benefit ratio of up to 1:34.<doc-sep>Behavioural family management in schizophrenia. Outcome of a clinic-based intervention.<doc-sep>To test further the highly successful outcomes of a controlled study of in-home behavioural family management (BFM) for schizophrenic patients, a clinic-based version of this intervention was compared with customary care alone for 41 schizophrenic patients in a Veterans Administration (VA) mental health clinic. Monthly Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) ratings, conducted by clinic psychiatrists who were 'blind' to the patients' assignment, revealed that 3 (14%) patients who received behavioural family management as well as customary care, as compared with 11 (55%) patients who received customary care alone, had symptomatic exacerbations during the first year of treatment.<doc-sep>",,"There is some evidence that family interventions may reduce the risk of relapse in people with schizophrenia.

6,"A comparison of proximal femoral nail antirotation and dynamic hip screw devices in trochanteric fractures.<doc-sep>This prospective, randomized study compared the functional outcome and complications associated with a proximal femoral nail antirotation (PFNA) device with those of a traditional extramedullary device, the dynamic hip screw (DHS), in patients with trochanteric fracture. A total of 121 patients were randomized to the PFNA group (n = 58) or the DHS group (n = 63). Perioperative information and complications were recorded, and assessments of functional outcome were made. The DHS group required a longer operative time and was associated with greater blood loss than the PFNA group. The re-operation rate was lower in the PFNA group compared with the DHS group, especially in patients with unstable fractures, although there was no statistically significant difference in the overall complication rate between the two groups. There were no significant differences in functional outcome between the PFNA and the DHS groups. In conclusion, the PFNA device is useful in the treatment of trochanteric fractures.<doc-sep>Intertrochanteric fractures of the femur: a randomized prospective comparison of the Gamma nail and the Ambi hip screw.<doc-sep>The Gamma nail has been introduced as an advance over the Ambi hip screw in intertrochanteric femoral fractures. Its efficacy in an Australasian setting has not been documented.
                A prospective randomized study was used to compare the Ambi hip screw and the Gamma nail for the treatment of 69 patients over the age of 50 years with intertrochanteric femoral fractures. The groups were similar with respect to age, sex, prefracture mobility and abode, anaesthetic risk grade, CT measured bone density and fracture pattern.
                Those treated with the Gamma nail had a significantly longer image intensifier screening time (P < 0.05), greater blood loss (P < 0.01) and more operative complications. There was no difference in the length of hospital stay but the level of mobility recovered was significantly better in the Ambi group at 6 months follow up. Urine retention was the most frequent complication but did not correlate with the implant or method of anaesthesia. Two implants cut out, one in each group. Limb shortening was similar in both groups and was not affected by leaving the Gamma nail unlocked distally in unstable fractures. Thirteen patients died from pre-existing medical conditions.
                The Gamma nail proved technically more demanding with higher intra-operative complications and inferior return of mobility.<doc-sep>Prospective randomized controlled trial of an intramedullary nail versus dynamic screw and plate for intertrochanteric fractures of the femur.<doc-sep>To compare the surgical complications and functional outcome of the Gamma nail intramedullary fixation device versus the Richards sliding hip screw and plate device in intertrochanteric femoral fractures.
                A prospective, randomised controlled clinical trial with observer blinding.
                A regional teaching hospital in the United Kingdom.
                All patients admitted from the local population with intertrochanteric fractured femurs were included. There were 400 patients entered into the study and 399 followed-up to one year or death.
                The devices were assigned by randomization to either a short-type Gamma nail (203 patients) or a Richard's-type sliding hip screw and plate (197 patients).
                The main surgical outcome measurements were fixation failure and reoperation. A functional outcome of pain, mobility status, and range of movement were assessed until one year.
                The requirement for revision in the Gamma nail group was twelve (6%); for Richard's group, eight (4%). This was not statistically different (p = 0.29; odds ratio, 1.48 [0.59-3.7]). A subcapital femoral fracture occurred in the Richard's group. Femoral shaft fractures occurred with four in the Gamma nail group (2%) and none in the Richard's group (p = 0.13). Three required revision to another implant. Lag-screw cut-out occurred in eight patients in the gamma nail group (4%) and four in the Richard's group (2%). This was not statistically significant (p = 0.37; odds ratio, 2.29 [0.6-9.0]). The development of other postoperative complications was the same in both groups. There was no difference between the two groups in terms of early or long-term functional status at one year.
                The use of an intramedullary device in the treatment of intertrochanteric femoral fractures is still associated with a higher but nonsignificant risk of postoperative complications. Routine use of the Gamma nail in this type of fracture cannot be recommended over the current standard treatment of dynamic hip screw and plate.<doc-sep>Fixation of intertrochanteric fractures of the femur. A randomised prospective comparison of the gamma nail and the dynamic hip screw.<doc-sep>We have prospectively compared the fixation of 100 intertrochanteric fractures of the proximal femur in elderly patients with random use of either a Dynamic Hip Screw (DHS) or a new intramedullary device, the Gamma nail. We found no difference in operating time, blood loss, wound complications, stay in hospital, place of eventual discharge, or the patients' mobility at final review. There was no difference in failure of proximal fixation: cut-out occurred in three cases with the DHS, and twice with the Gamma nail. However, in four cases fracture of the femur occurred close to the Gamma nail, requiring further major surgery. In the absence of these complications, union was seen by six months in both groups.<doc-sep>Comparison of dynamic hip screw and gamma nail: a prospective, randomized, controlled trial.<doc-sep>We report a prospective, randomized, controlled trial, comparing the results of treatment with a dynamic hip screw (DHS) and a gamma nail in 95 consecutive patients with peri-trochanteric fractures of the femur. The DHS was used in 48 patients, the gamma nail in 47. Clinical and radiological outcomes were similar, but the gamma nail was associated with a higher incidence of complications, in particular fracture of the femur below the implant in eight cases. This is consistent with previous reports, and we do not recommend the gamma nail for the treatment of peri-trochanteric femoral fractures.<doc-sep>A prospective trial comparing the Holland nail with the dynamic hip screw in the treatment of intertrochanteric fractures of the hip.<doc-sep>We compared the outcome of patients treated for an intertrochanteric fracture of the femoral neck with a locked, long intramedullary nail with those treated with a dynamic hip screw (DHS) in a prospective randomised study. Each patient who presented with an extra-capsular hip fracture was randomised to operative stabilisation with either a long intramedullary Holland nail or a DHS. We treated 92 patients with a Holland nail and 98 with a DHS. Pre-operative variables included the Mini Mental test score, patient mobility, fracture pattern and American Society of Anesthesiologists grading. Peri-operative variables were anaesthetic time, operating time, radiation time and blood loss. Post-operative variables were time to mobilising with a frame, wound infection, time to discharge, time to fracture union, and mortality. We found no significant difference in the pre-operative variables. The mean anaesthetic and operation times were shorter in the DHS group than in the Holland nail group (29.7 vs 40.4 minutes, p < 0.001; and 40.3 vs 54 minutes, p < 0.001, respectively). There was an increased mean blood loss within the DHS group versus the Holland nail group (160 ml vs 78 ml, respectively, p < 0.001). The mean time to mobilisation with a frame was shorter in the Holland nail group (DHS 4.3 days, Holland nail 3.6 days, p = 0.012). More patients needed a post-operative blood transfusion in the DHS group (23 vs seven, p = 0.003) and the mean radiation time was shorter in this group (DHS 0.9 minutes vs Holland nail 1.56 minutes, p < 0.001). The screw of the DHS cut out in two patients, one of whom underwent revision to a Holland nail. There were no revisions in the Holland nail group. All fractures in both groups were united when followed up after one year. We conclude that the DHS can be implanted more quickly and with less exposure to radiation than the Holland nail. However, the resultant blood loss and need for transfusion is greater. The Holland nail allows patients to mobilise faster and to a greater extent. We have therefore adopted the Holland nail as our preferred method of treating intertrochanteric fractures of the hip.<doc-sep>[Classic nail versus DHS. A prospective randomised study of fixation of trochanteric femur fractures].<doc-sep>The intramedullary hip screw system Classic-Nail and the Dynamic Hip Screw (DHS) were evaluated in a prospective-randomized clinical trial for operative treatment of trochanteric femur fractures. Hundred and ten geriatric patients (mean age 82 years) were runningly included in the study (56 Classic Nail, 54 DHS). No significant differences between the two study groups were observed with regard to treatment and follow-up data. With the Classic-Nail one complete femur shaft fracture and one incomplete fracture occurred at the tip of the nail intraoperatively and could successfully be fixed with cerclage wires. In the DHS group two patients underwent reoperation for significant loss of reduction early postoperatively. At an average follow-up of 3.7 months all fractures were healed with no difference in functional outcome between the two groups.--Classic Nail and DHS both lead to equally good results in the operative treatment of trochanteric femur fractures.<doc-sep>The trochanteric gamma nail versus the dynamic hip screw: a prospective randomised study. One-year follow-up of 146 intertrochanteric fractures.<doc-sep>In a prospective, randomized trial we compared the trochanteric gamma nail (TGN) and the dynamic hip screw (DHS) in the treatment of 146 intertrochanteric fractures. Follow-up was after four and 12 months. The operation time was significantly shorter in the DHS group. At discharge the need for walking aids was less in the DHS group. There were no differences in intraoperative blood loss, medical complications, mortality or length of hospital stay. Major fracture complications occurred twiceas often in the TGN group compared with the DHS group, however they were not statistically significant. Any potential for the TGN leading to a less invasive procedure and a more rapid postoperative mobilisation could not be demonstrated. Compared with the TGN we prefer the DHS for most intertrochanteric fractures in a setting where the majority of these fractures are treated by younger doctors and not by highly specialized hip/trauma surgeons. The TGN may have advantages in selected intertrochanteric fractures.;<doc-sep>Intramedullary versus extramedullary fixation for the treatment of intertrochanteric hip fractures.<doc-sep>One hundred thirty-one patients (135 fractures) who sustained an intertrochanteric fracture were assigned randomly to treatment with either a sliding hip screw or an intramedullary hip screw and followed up prospectively. In patients with unstable intertrochanteric fractures, the intramedullary device was associated with 23% less surgical time and 44% less blood loss; however, use of the intramedullary hip screw in patients who had a stable fracture pattern required 70% greater fluoroscopic time. Intraoperative complications occurred exclusively in patients in the intramedullary hip screw group. There were no differences in the rates of functional recovery between the two fixation groups.<doc-sep>Treatment of intertrochanteric fracture with the Gamma AP locking nail or by a compression hip screw--a randomised prospective trial.<doc-sep>The Gamma AP (Asia-Pacific) locking nail (GAPN) is a modification of the standard Gamma locking nail made especially for use in Oriental patients. We made a randomised prospective comparison of the compression hip screw (CHS) and the Gamma AP locking nail for the internal fixation of 60 intertrochanteric fractures of the hip in elderly patients by comparing perioperative details and analysing the radiographic and clinical results. The operation time for the GAPN group was shorter than for the CHS group and the intraoperative blood loss was lower. The Gamma AP nail enabled earlier mobilisation. We found no significant difference in the time to union and the length of sliding of the lag screw between the two groups. The decrease in the neck shaft angle in the Gamma nail group was significantly smaller than in the CHS patients. There were no significant mechanical complications, such as fracture of the femoral shaft or failure of fixation in the Gamma nail group. On the basis of our observations we conclude that the Gamma AP locking nail is more efficient than the CHS in the treatment of intertrochanteric fractures in geriatric patients.<doc-sep>Use of an intramedullary hip-screw compared with a compression hip-screw with a plate for intertrochanteric femoral fractures. A prospective, randomized study of one hundred patients.<doc-sep>One hundred elderly patients who had an intertrochanteric femoral fracture were randomized to treatment with a compression hip-screw with a plate (fifty patients) or a new intramedullary device, the intramedullary hip-screw (fifty patients). All patients were followed prospectively for one year or until death. A detailed assessment of the functional status and the plain radiographs of the hip was performed one, three, six, and twelve months postoperatively. The two treatment groups were strictly comparable. The operative time needed to insert the intramedullary hip-screw was significantly greater than that needed to insert the compression hip-screw with the plate (p = 0.02), but use of the intramedullary hip-screw was associated with less estimated intraoperative blood loss (p = 0.011). The prevalence of perioperative complications, such as bronchopneumonia, cardiac failure, and urinary tract infection, was comparable in the two treatment groups. There were one intraoperative fracture of the femoral shaft and two intraoperative fractures of the greater trochanter in the group managed with the intramedullary hip-screw. One patient had pulling-out of the compression hip-screw on the seventh postoperative day. Four patients had a trochanteric wound hematoma, without infection, after insertion of an intramedullary hip-screw. All but one of the fractures healed. The one non-union, which was in a patient who had a compression hip-screw, was treated with a hemiarthroplasty. The mortality rate was similar in the two treatment groups. The patients who had an intramedullary hip-screw had, on the average, significantly better mobility at one (p < 0.0001) and three months (p = 0.0013) postoperatively. This difference was no longer seen at six and twelve months, although the patients who had an intramedullary hip-screw still had significantly better walking ability outside the home at those time-periods (p = 0.05). The compression hip-screw was removed from two patients because of pain in the mid-portion of the thigh, which had begun after consolidation of the fracture. Fourteen patients who had an intramedullary hip-screw had cortical hypertrophy at the level of the tip of the nail at twelve months postoperatively. Cortical hypertrophy was significantly related to the use of two interlocking screws (p = 0.02). Six of these patients also had pain in the mid-portion of the thigh, and the nail had been locked with two screws in five of them. Three of the six patients had the hardware removed because of the pain, and the symptoms resolved. A seventh patient had pain without cortical hypertrophy. The intramedullary hip-screw device was associated with significantly less sliding of the lag-screw and subsequent shortening of the limb in the region of the thigh (p = 0.012 and 0.019, respectively); these differences were more pronounced when the unstable fractures in the two treatment groups were compared (p < 0.001).<doc-sep>Intramedullary nailing versus fixed angle blade plating for subtrochanteric femoral fractures: a prospective randomised controlled trial.<doc-sep>To compare closed intramedullary nailing to open reduction and internal fixation using a fixed angle blade plate for the management of subtrochanteric femoral fractures.

                There were no significant differences between the 2 groups with regard to age, time to surgery, operating time, receipt of blood transfusions, duration of hospital stay, or fracture classification. The revision rate was 28% (8/29) in the BP group and none in the IN group; the difference was statistically significant.

                Prospective, randomized trial. Eighty patients aged 60 and over with stable trochanteric fracture were selected and then randomized using a table of randomized numbers. Length of time of operative procedure, hemoglobin levels at 6 and 48 h after surgery, packed cells units administered, and hospital stay were recorded. In addition, the postoperative complications in the first year after the surgery was collected.
                No differences were found in hospital stay, surgical time, blood loss, functional outcome at 1-year follow-up, neck-shaft angle, fracture collapse, and mortality.
                PCCP and Gamma 3 have not presented significant differences in any measured parameter for treatment of stable trochanteric fractures. Therefore, the PCCP system is shown to be as minimally invasive as the Gamma 3.<doc-sep>A comparison of the long gamma nail with the sliding hip screw for the treatment of AO/OTA 31-A2 fractures of the proximal part of the femur: a prospective randomized trial.<doc-sep>Controversy exists with regard to whether to treat AO/OTA 31-A2 fractures of the proximal part of the femur with an intramedullary device or an extramedullary device. A prospective, randomized, controlled trial was performed to compare the outcome of treatment of these unstable fractures of the proximal part of the femur with either a sliding hip screw or a long gamma nail.
                Two hundred and ten patients presenting with an AO/OTA 31-A2 fracture of the proximal part of the femur were randomized, at the time of admission, to fixation with use of either a long gamma nail or a sliding hip screw. The primary outcome measure was reoperation within the first postoperative year. Secondary measures included mortality, length of hospital stay, transfusion rate, change in mobility and residence, and quality of life as measured with the EuroQol 5D outcome score.
                There was no significant difference between the reoperation rates for the two groups. In total, five patients (three from the long-gamma-nail group and two from the sliding-hip-screw group) underwent revision surgery because of cut-out. Tip-apex distance was found to correlate with the implant cut-out rate. There was no significant difference between the two groups in terms of the EuroQol 5D outcome scores, the mortality rates after correction for the mini-mental score, or any of the secondary outcome measures.
                When compared with the long gamma nail, the sliding hip screw should remain the gold standard for the treatment of AO/OTA 31-A2 fractures of the proximal part of the femur because it is associated with similar outcomes with less expense.<doc-sep>A prospective randomised comparison of the dynamic hip screw and the gamma locking nail.<doc-sep>We made a randomised prospective comparison of the Dynamic Hip Screw and the Gamma locking nail for the internal fixation of 200 petrochanteric femoral fractures in elderly patients. There was less intraoperative blood loss and a lower rate of wound complications in the patients treated by the Gamma nail. They had, however, a high incidence of femoral shaft fracture which we relate in part to implant design. We do not recommend the use of the Gamma nail for these fractures.<doc-sep>Treatment of reverse oblique and transverse intertrochanteric fractures with use of an intramedullary nail or a 95 degrees screw-plate: a prospective, randomized study.<doc-sep>Intertrochanteric fractures are composed of different anatomic patterns that vary in their degree of stability following open reduction and internal fixation. A particularly unstable group is classified as AO/OTA 31-A3, with the fracture pattern described as reverse oblique or transverse. The purpose of this study was to compare the results of intramedullary fixation with those of plate fixation for these intertrochanteric fractures in elderly patients.
                Thirty-nine elderly patients with AO/OTA 31-A3 intertrochanteric fractures of the femur were randomized into two treatment groups and were followed for a minimum of one year. The nineteen patients in Group I were treated with a 95 fixed-angle screw-plate (Dynamic Condylar Screw), and the twenty patients in Group II were treated with an intramedullary nail (Proximal Femoral Nail). The treatment groups were comparable with regard to all demographic and injury variables.
                Patients treated with an intramedullary nail had shorter operative times, fewer blood transfusions, and shorter hospital stays compared with those treated with a 95 screw-plate. Implant failure and/or nonunion was noted in seven of the nineteen patients who had been treated with the 95 screw-plate. Only one of the twenty fractures that had been treated with an intramedullary nail did not heal.
                The results of our study support the use of an intramedullary nail rather than a 95 screw-plate for the fixation of reverse oblique and transverse intertrochanteric fractures in elderly patients.<doc-sep>Gamma nails and dynamic hip screws for peritrochanteric fractures. A randomised prospective study in elderly patients.<doc-sep>The Gamma nail was introduced for the treatment of peritrochanteric fractures with the theoretical advantage of a load-sharing femoral component which could be implanted by a closed procedure. We report a randomised prospective study of 186 fractures treated by either the Gamma nail or a dynamic hip screw. Gamma nails were implanted with significantly shorter screening times, smaller incisions, and less intraoperative bleeding. The Gamma nail group had a shorter convalescence and earlier full weight-bearing, but there was no significant difference in mortality within six months, postoperative mobility, or hip function at review. More intra-operative complications were recorded in the Gamma nail group, mainly due to the mismatching of the femoral component of the nail to the small femurs of Chinese people. Use of a smaller modified nail reduced these complications. We conclude that with careful surgical technique and the modified femoral component, the Gamma nail is an advance in the treatment of peritrochanteric fractures.<doc-sep>A randomised comparison of AMBI, TGN and PFN for treatment of unstable trochanteric fractures.<doc-sep>In this study, we initiated a prospective, randomised, clinical trial comparing the AMBI, TGN and PFN operations used for treatment of unstable fractures, for differences in intra-operative use, consolidation, complications and functional outcome.
                We have compared the pre-, intra- and post-operating variables of AMBI, TGN and PFN operations that were used for treatment of unstable trochanteric fractures, of 120 patients all above 60 years old diagnosed with extracapsular hip fractures classified as AO Type 31-A2 or Type 31-A3.
                According to our results the three methods are comparable in the treatment of unstable trochanteric fractures of patients above 60 years old.
                The AMBI remains the gold standard for the fractures of trochanteric region. TGN has an easier and faster procedure, facilitates early weight bearing and had minor late complications. An improper use of the PFN system was the reason for the most complications and the longer operation time of the device. PFN is also an accepted minimally invasive implant for unstable proximal femoral fractures but future modification of the implant to avoid Z-effect phenomenon, careful surgical technique and selection of the patients should reduce its high complication rate.<doc-sep>[Pertrochanteric fractures: a randomized prospective study comparing dynamic screw plate and intramedullary fixation].<doc-sep>The objective of this study was to compare the dynamic hip screw (Synthes) and intramedullary fixation (Targon PF, Aesculap) for the treatment of pertrochanteric fractures in terms of stability, complications and cost effectiveness.
                This prospective randomized study included 60 patients hospitalized in an emergency setting for pertrochanteric fractures between December 2003 and June 2004. All surgeons in our unit participated in the study. Two fixation systems were used: the Targon proximal femoral nail (Aesculap) and the screw-plate dynamic hip screw (Synthes). We noted: patient status (ASA classification), operative data (type of implant, duration), postoperative data (blood loss, radiographic findings, early complications), and outcome (Harris score, time to walking, mortality). All patients were assessed three months after surgery. The series included 60 patients, 14 men (23%) and 46 women (77%). The Targon PF nail was used for 34 patients and the DHS for 26. In the intramedullary fixation group mean age was 81 years (SD = 12.8, range 23-96); it was 82 years (SD 9.8, range 47-97) in the screw-plate group. The AO classification was: intramedullary fixation 31A1 (n = 11), 31A2 (n = 20), 31A3 (n = 3); screw-plate 31A1 (n = 14), 31A2 (n = 11), 31A3 (n = 1). Thirty-one fractures were stable, 29 unstable. Unstable fractures were treated with the Targon PF nail (n = 18) and the DHS screw-plate (n = 11). Stable fractures were treated with the Targon PF nail (n = 15) and the DHS screw-plate (n = 15).
                Mean operative time was 35 minutes for intramedullary nailing and 42 mintues for screw-plate fixation. Mean blood loss was 410 ml for intramedullary nailing and 325 ml for screw-plate fixation (p = 0.07). Mean hospital stay was the same (11 days) in both groups. At three months, mechanical complications involved migration of the cervical screw outside the femoral head for three Targon PF fixations and for two DHS fixations. Screw migration was favored by fracture instability and presence of osteoporosis. There were two deaths in the intramedullary nailing group and one in the screw-plate group. Time to walking was 20 days on average in the intramedullary nailing group and 25 days in the screw-plate group. The mean Harris hip score was 60 in the intramedullary group and 59 in the screw-plate group.
                Data in the literature report an advantage for intramedullary nailing, particularly a mechanical advantage, for the treatment of pertrochanteric fractures. Our findings show that good results are obtained with the screw-plate fixation using the DHS with less blood loss and at a lower cost.<doc-sep>Prospective randomized comparison between a dynamic hip screw and a mini-invasive static nail in fractures of the trochanteric area: preliminary results.<doc-sep>This study aimed at comparing the results obtained with a sliding screw plate and an experimental device including a small-diameter nail that can be placed with a mini-invasive approach and provides a stable fixation.
                Randomized prospective study.
                University hospital.
                The study included two groups with thirty fractures of the trochanteric area.
                In both groups, the surgical procedure was carried out on patients placed on a traction table in a supine position, under an x-ray amplifier. Sliding screw plates (THS) were set in place according to the usual open technique. Nails were placed through a twenty-millimeter supratrochanteric cutaneous incision. This experimental system comprised a locked intramedullary nail with two nonparallel seven-millimeter cervicocephalic screws.
                The comparison between the two groups was based on the surgical procedure (time, duration of x-ray irradiation, and total blood loss); the initial postoperative period (complications, duration of hospital stay, and the time before returning home); the time before full weight bearing became effective; the functional and social recovery; mortality; and the quality of immediate and final anatomic restitution and healing.
                Operating time (p < 0.001) and blood loss (p < 0.001) were lower in the nail group, and no blood transfusion was required. Postoperative pain (p < 0.01), time necessary to support full weight bearing (p < 0.02), and time before returning home (p < 0.05) were reduced in the nail group. All fractures healed in the same amount of time, with good anatomic results in the nail group, whereas ten impactions beyond ten millimeters occurred in the plate group. No difference was found between the two groups in walking ability and autonomy recovery, but hip function (p < 0.05) was better in the nail group.
                This preliminary clinical study has shown the advantages of this mini-invasive technique. It could not evaluate all the possible disadvantages inherent in the method. These points will be evaluated in a multicenter study justified by these preliminary results.<doc-sep>[The gamma-nail as a resilient alternative to the dynamic hip screw in unstable proximal femoral fractures in the elderly].<doc-sep>In a prospective randomised trial between September 1989 and June 1990 one hundred patients with per- and subtrochanteric fractures were consecutively treated by gamma-nail or DHS. The average age of both groups was about 80 years. The operation time for gamma-nailing was longer than for DHS implantation and also the postoperative blood loss was higher in the gamma-nail group. We found no difference of intraoperative blood loss, of perioperative lethality and in duration of hospital care. 90% of gamma-nail patients and 80% of DHS patients were successfully able to walk four days after operation with full weight bearing on the operated limb. Three patients in the DHS group with unstable fractures got cranial perforation of the cephalic screw mobilisation. Five patients of the gamma-nail group were reoperated, one case because of missed distal locking, one because of cranial perforation of the cephalic screw after varus dislocation of the proximal fragment. One patient suffered intraoperatively a proximal femur shaft fracture which was corrected during operation. In one case a wound hematoma was evacuated, an other patient needed secondary wound closure. Despite technical imperfection of implant and instruments, we conclude that the gamma-nail allows a very high percentage early and full weight bearing immediately after operation. So we consider that in the treatment of unstable pertrochanteric fractures of geriatric patients, the gamma-nail has proven to be more efficient than the DHS.<doc-sep>Intramedullary hip screw versus sliding hip screw for unstable intertrochanteric femoral fractures in the elderly.<doc-sep>We report a randomised, prospective study comparing a standard sliding hip screw and the intramedullary hip screw for the treatment of unstable intertrochanteric fractures in the elderly. One hundred and two patients were randomised on admission to two treatment groups. Fifty-two patients were treated with a compression hip screw (CHS), and fifty had intramedullary fixation with an intramedullary hip screw (IMHS). Patients were followed for 1 year and had a clinical and radiological review at 3, 6 and 12 months. The mean duration of operation and fluoroscopy screening time was significantly greater for insertion of the intramedullary hip screw. There was no difference between the groups with regard to transfusion requirements or time to mobilise after surgery. There were two technical complications in the CHS group and three in the IMHS group. There was no significant difference between the two groups in radiological or functional outcome at 12 months. It remains to be shown whether the theoretical advantages of intramedullary fixation of extracapsular hip fractures bring a significant improvement in eventual outcome.<doc-sep>Functional outcome in treatment of unstable trochanteric and subtrochanteric fractures with the proximal femoral nail and the Medoff sliding plate.<doc-sep>To compare outcome between the proximal femoral nail (PFN) and the Medoff sliding plate (MSP) in patients with unstable trochanteric or subtrochanteric fractures.
                This was a consecutive prospective randomized clinical study. In all, 203 patients admitted to two university hospitals with an unstable trochanteric or a subtrochanteric fracture type were included. Surgery was performed with a short intramedullary nail or a dual-sliding plate device. Follow up visits occurred at 6 weeks, 4 months, and 12 months. Functional outcome was measured by walking ability, rising from a chair, curb test, and additional assessments of abductor strength, pain, living conditions, and complications.
                The ability to walk 15 m at 6 weeks was significantly better in the PFN group compared to the MSP group with an odds ratio 2.2 (P = 0.04, 95% confidence limits 1.03-4.67). No statistical difference in walking ability could be found between trochanteric and subtrochanteric fractures. The major complication rate (8% in the PFN group and 4% in the MSP group) did not differ statistically (P = 0.50) but reoperations were more frequent in the PFN group (9%) compared to the MSP group (1%; P < 0.02).
                There were no major differences in functional outcome or major complications between the treatment groups. Reasons other than the operated fracture seem to be equally important in determining the long-term functional ability of the patients in our study. An advantage with the MSP was the lower reoperation rate.<doc-sep>Systematic effects of surgical treatment of hip fractures: gliding screw-plating vs intramedullary nailing.<doc-sep>Numerous studies have been published regarding the comparison between intramedullary nail and the dynamic hip screw and plate for the fixation of intertrochanteric fractures in elderly patients. In this paper we present a comparative study of these two methods regarding their systemic effects on this group of patients.
                This is a randomized trial of 120 consecutive patients with an intertrochanteric fracture treated with either extramedullary fixation (dynamic hip screw and plate; DHS, Synthes-Stratec, Oberdorf, Switzerland) or intramedullary nail (Gamma nail, Stryker Howmedica, Freiburg, Germany and Endovis BA, Citieffe, Bologna, Italy). The parameters that we assessed pre-operatively, in addition to their demographics, included their mental state (MMSE), their nutritional and immune state and their pulmonary function. Intra-operatively we calculated the amount of radiation exposure, the amount of blood loss and the length of operative time for each procedure. Postoperatively we repeated the calculation of the mental and pulmonary state and the blood loss, during days 1, 3, and 10 and related them to the ease of the patient's mobilization.
                Decreased bleeding and post-operative pain, reduced post-operative morbidity and faster recovery of function were better but not significant in the group of intramedullary fixation (all p>0.05). However, in the same group there were slightly more patients in whom the MMSE was falling, together with their pulmonary function, suggesting that this method probably predisposes to higher chances of pulmonary dysfunction and the possibility of pulmonary embolism.
                We found no significant differences between the two methods of stabilization of these fractures regarding their systemic effects perioperatively. The classic dynamic hip screw can preserve its position as a safe and effective solution for these already vulnerable patients having sustained a trochanteric fracture against the novel intramedullary techniques.

A randomised study comparing post-operative rehabilitation.<doc-sep>We treated 108 patients with a pertrochanteric femoral fracture using either the dynamic hip screw or the proximal femoral nail in this prospective, randomised series. We compared walking ability before fracture, intra-operative variables and return to their residence. Patients treated with the proximal femoral nail (n = 42) had regained their pre-operative walking ability significantly (p = 0.04) more often by the four-month review than those treated with the dynamic hip screw (n = 41). Peri-operative or immediate post-operative measures of outcome did not differ between the groups, with the exception of operation time. The dynamic hip screw allowed a significantly greater compression of the fracture during the four-month follow-up, but consolidation of the fracture was comparable between the two groups. Two major losses of reduction were observed in each group, resulting in a total of four revision operations. Our results suggest that the use of the proximal femoral nail may allow a faster post-operative restoration of walking ability, when compared with the dynamic hip screw.<doc-sep>Pertrochanteric fractures: is there an advantage to an intramedullary nail?: a randomized, prospective study of 206 patients comparing the dynamic hip screw and proximal femoral nail.<doc-sep>To compare the results between a sliding compression hip screw and an intramedullary nail in the treatment of pertrochanteric fractures.

Current standards of surgical fixation for the myriad possible fracture patterns include the compression hip screw (CHS), the 90 degrees/95 degrees blade plate, and locked intramedullary nails. The gamma nail (GN) was designed as a ""hybrid"" of these devices, combining theoretical biomechanical advantages that should allow earlier postoperative weight bearing with surgical technique advantages that should decrease operative morbidity. Because these theoretical advantages were unproven in a clinical setting, we prospectively randomized 75 consecutive patients with peritrochanteric femur fractures into two groups to examine the fixation of these fractures with the GN as compared to the CHS. We found no significant differences in preoperative or intraoperative parameters. Postoperatively, the subtrochanteric fracture group treated with the GN achieved earlier weightbearing status, although this was not statistically significant. 72 patients were available for follow-up at a minimum of 6 months. All fractures had clinically and radiographically healed, and 94% of the patients continued to be ambulatory. Major complications included missed distal locking screws (one patient), cutting out of the lag screw superiorly in the femoral head (two patients), and a femur fracture at the distal end of the GN (one patient). In our series, the GN produced clinical results commensurate with current standards of fixation for peritrochanteric femur fractures. Although the GN allowed earlier independent weightbearing status in patients with subtrochanteric fractures, the procedure was technically more demanding and had a significant learning curve.<doc-sep>Trochanteric gamma nail and compression hip screw for trochanteric fractures: a randomized, prospective, comparative study in 210 elderly patients with a new design of the gamma nail.<doc-sep>To compare the results between a new intramedullary Gamma nail and a compression hip screw in the treatment of trochanteric fractures.

                Two hundred ten consecutive patients older than 65 years with trochanteric femoral fractures.
                Treatment with a compression hip screw or a new design of the Trochanteric Gamma nail (180 mm in length with a mediolateral angle of 4 degrees and available only with a proximal diameter of 17 mm and distal diameter of 11 mm).
                Operative and fluoroscopy times, blood loss, functional outcome, complication rate, and failure of fixation.
                The Trochanteric Gamma nail was used in 104 patients and the compression hip screw in 106. The 2 groups were similar in terms of their preoperative data, with a median follow-up of 13.6 months (range 12-30). The results show no difference in operating time (P = 0.21), but the Trochanteric Gamma nail group had a significantly shorter fluoroscopy time (P = 0.006), and the number of patients transfused and the mean of units of blood transfused were significantly less in the Trochanteric Gamma nail group (P = 0.013, 0.046, respectively). Mortality within 12 months was similar in both groups (P = 0.83). All fractures were radiographically healed at the last visit. There was no difference in intraoperative and postoperative complications or rate of fixation failure between the 2 groups, and no case of secondary shaft fracture of the femur was encountered in this study. In the entire series, there was no difference in the functional outcome (P = 0.74), but the postoperative walking ability was better in those patients with unstable fractures who were treated with the Trochanteric Gamma nail (P = 0.017).
                The new Trochanteric Gamma nail is an effective method for the treatment of trochanteric femoral fractures in elderly patients. The indication for either Trochanteric Gamma nail or compression hip screw is similar in stable fractures, but we recommend the use of the Trochanteric Gamma nail for unstable trochanteric fractures.<doc-sep>The standard Gamma nail or the Medoff sliding plate for unstable trochanteric and subtrochanteric fractures. A randomised, controlled trial.<doc-sep>We studied 217 patients with an unstable trochanteric or subtrochanteric fracture who had been randomly allocated to treatment by either internal fixation with a standard Gamma nail (SGN) or a Medoff sliding plate (MSP, biaxial dynamisation mode). Their mean age was 84 years (65 to 99) and they were reviewed at four and 12 months after surgery. Assessments of outcome included general complications, technical failures, revision surgery, activities of daily living (ADL), hip function (Charnley score) and the health-related quality of life (HRQOL, EQ-5D). The rate of technical failure in patients with unstable trochanteric fractures was 6.5% (6/93) (including intra-operative femoral fractures) in the SGN group and 5.2% (5/96) in the MSP group. In patients with subtrochanteric fractures, there were no failures in the SGN group (n = 16) and two in the MSP group (n = 12). In the SGN group, there were intra-operative femoral fractures in 2.8% (3/109) and no post-operative fractures. There was a reduced need for revision surgery in the SGN group compared with the MSP group (8.3%; 9/108; p = 0.072). The SGN group also showed a lower incidence of severe general complications (p < 0.05) and a trend towards a lower incidence of wound infections (p = 0.05). There were no differences between the groups regarding the outcome of ADL, hip function or the HRQOL. The reduction in the HRQOL (EQ-5D(index) score) was significant in both groups compared with that before the fracture (p < 0.005). Our findings indicate that the SGN showed good results in both trochanteric and subtrochanteric fractures. The limited number of intra-operative femoral fractures did not influence the outcome or the need for revision surgery. Moreover, the SGN group had a reduced number of serious general complications and wound infections compared with the MSP group. The MSP in the biaxial dynamisation mode had a low rate of failure in trochanteric fractures but an unacceptably high rate when used in the biaxial dynamisation mode in subtrochanteric fractures. The negative influence of an unstable trochanteric or subtrochanteric fracture on the quality of life was significant regardless of the surgical method.<doc-sep>[Osteosynthesis of per- and subtrochanteric fractures by blade plate versus gamma nail.

                Between 1993 and 1995, 26 patients addressed to our Center for a Kyle IV [1] fracture were divided into 2 groups, one fixed with blade plate and the other with Gamma nail. The follow-up for all patients is 12 months.
                Gamma nail allows early weight-bearing in all patients, fracture healing is acquired at 4.2 months; an operative diaphyseal fracture needed conversion to a long Gamma nail. We observed a slight cut-out that didn't need reoperation. In the blade plate group, we noticed three femoral head necrosis without major flattening, two non-unions, one plate's breakage and two malunions; fracture healing is acquired at 6.3 months. The two non-unions and the plate's breakage didn't need reoperation because of low functional demand.

In the CEA group, 15 ml of 0.375% bupivacaine and 150 micrograms fentanyl were injected into the epidural space at C7-D1 level. In the GA group, patients were anaesthetized with 0.2 mg.kg-1 flunitrazepam and 5 micrograms.kg-1 fentanyl; intubation was carried out using 0.08 mg.kg-1 vecuronium, and the patients were ventilated with a mixture of nitrous oxide and oxygen (50% of each). Further injections, every 30 min, of 2 micrograms.kg-1 fentanyl were given to the patients in group GA. Blood pressure was monitored continuously, up to 4 h postoperatively, with a radial arterial catheter. Per- or postoperative hypertension was defined as a rise in systolic arterial blood pressure (Pasys) over 180 mmHg for greater than 3 min; this was treated with 20 mg nifedipine intranasally (group CEA) or 100 micrograms fentanyl with 0.5 mg flunitrazepam with or without nifedipine (group GA). Per- or postoperative hypotension was defined as a fall in Pasys below 100 mmHg and or a 30% fall in mean arterial blood pressure for greater than 3 min; this was treated, in both groups, with an intravenous bolus of 3 mg ephedrine. Patients in group CEA experienced more frequent episodes of peroperative hypertension (8/2; p less than 0.02) and postoperative hypotension (5/1) than group GA.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)<doc-sep>Local versus general anaesthesia in carotid surgery. A prospective, randomised study.<doc-sep>A randomised, prospective study was performed to compare local (LA) and general anaesthesia (GA) in carotid surgery with special emphasis on complications and the need for intra-operative shunting. Fifty-six patients were randomised to LA and 55 to GA. Eight patients in the LA group required a GA for various reasons. During the same period 14 patients were not randomised. Seven perioperative neurological deficits occurred (5.6%), four in the LA group, two in the GA group, and one in the non-randomised group (NS). Selective shunting was used, in the Ga group according to stump pressure or in cases with a previous stroke and in the LA group according to the appearance of neurological symptoms. In the GA group 25 patients were shunted and in the LA group five patients (P less than 0.001) needed a shunt. If strict pressure criteria for shunting had been used in the LA patients, ten would have been shunted and three of the patients who developed symptoms during clamping would not have been shunted. During surgery the highest recorded systolic pressure was significantly higher in the LA group (210 mmHg versus 173 mmHg, P less than 0.001). LA for carotid endarterectomy is comparable with general anaesthesia regarding peroperative complications but produces significantly higher blood pressures than general anaesthesia. On the other hand it allows the possibility of neurologic monitoring of the patient and leads to significantly less use of an intra-operative shunt.<doc-sep>Hemodynamic status following regional and general anesthesia for carotid endarterectomy.<doc-sep>We prospectively studied 23 patients undergoing carotid endarterectomy under regional (n = 13) or general (n = 10) anesthesia to determine the hemodynamic basis of increased frequency in the need for postoperative vasopressor support when regional anesthesia was used. Anesthesia and postoperative care were conducted without reference to hemodynamic data from pulmonary artery catheterization. Although mean arterial pressure was similar in the two groups postoperatively, 11 of the 13 patients undergoing regional anesthesia and 3 of the 10 patients undergoing general anesthesia required phenylephrine postoperatively. No patient required therapy postoperatively to reduce a systolic pressure exceeding 160 mm Hg. Mean arterial pressure remained below the preoperative baseline value in both groups (p < 0.05 with general anesthesia; p = 0.06 with regional anesthesia) during follow-up. In the general anesthesia group, systemic vascular resistance declined significantly below baseline (p < 0.05) following the operation, accompanied by a decline in mean arterial pressure (p < 0.05) and a higher cardiac output. Intraoperative fluid requirements were greater during general anesthesia than during regional anesthesia (p < 0.01). Pulmonary artery occlusion pressure was lower postoperatively than at baseline in both groups (p < 0.05). Pulmonary artery occlusion pressure was higher in the general anesthesia group despite the greater use of phenylephrine in the regional anesthesia group.<doc-sep>General anaesthesia versus local anaesthesia for carotid surgery (GALA): a multicentre, randomised controlled trial.<doc-sep>The effect of carotid endarterectomy in lowering the risk of stroke ipsilateral to severe atherosclerotic carotid-artery stenosis is offset by complications during or soon after surgery. We compared surgery under general anaesthesia with that under local anaesthesia because prediction and avoidance of perioperative strokes might be easier under local anaesthesia than under general anaesthesia.
                We undertook a parallel group, multicentre, randomised controlled trial of 3526 patients with symptomatic or asymptomatic carotid stenosis from 95 centres in 24 countries. Participants were randomly assigned to surgery under general (n=1753) or local (n=1773) anaesthesia between June, 1999 and October, 2007. The primary outcome was the proportion of patients with stroke (including retinal infarction), myocardial infarction, or death between randomisation and 30 days after surgery. Analysis was by intention to treat. The trial is registered with Current Control Trials number ISRCTN00525237.
                A primary outcome occurred in 84 (4.8%) patients assigned to surgery under general anaesthesia and 80 (4.5%) of those assigned to surgery under local anaesthesia; three events per 1000 treated were prevented with local anaesthesia (95% CI -11 to 17; risk ratio [RR] 0.94 [95% CI 0.70 to 1.27]). The two groups did not significantly differ for quality of life, length of hospital stay, or the primary outcome in the prespecified subgroups of age, contralateral carotid occlusion, and baseline surgical risk.
                We have not shown a definite difference in outcomes between general and local anaesthesia for carotid surgery. The anaesthetist and surgeon, in consultation with the patient, should decide which anaesthetic technique to use on an individual basis.

A randomised clinical trial.<doc-sep>to examine the effects of type of anaesthesia on cerebral blood flow during carotid endarterectomy (CEA).
                prospective randomised study.
                thirty-four CEA procedures under local anaesthesia (LA) are compared to 33 procedures under general anaesthesia (GA). Mean middle cerebral artery velocity (MCAV(mean)) was monitored using Transcranial Doppler (TCD) and mean arterial pressure (MAP) assessed by continuous intra-arterial blood pressure transducer.
                pre-op MCAV(mean) and MAP were similar in both groups. Pre-clamp MCAV(mean) was similar in both groups and did not differ from pre-op values. With carotid clamping the MCAV(mean) significantly dropped in both groups. The post-clamp MCAV(mean) was significantly less in the GA group (p < 0.05), and the percentage reduction in MCAV(mean) significantly more for GA procedures (p < 0.05). Pre-clamp MAP was significantly elevated in LA procedures and significantly lowered in GA procedures. Pre-clamp MAP was significant less for GA procedures (p < 0.001). Post clamp MAP did not differ from pre-clamp levels in either group. There was no correlation between MCAV(mean) and MAP. Complication rate, combined death/stroke rates were similar in each group.
                LA CEA is associated with better preservation of the ipsilateral cerebral circulation and increased tolerance of the effects of carotid clamping. Changes in MCAV(mean) cannot be explained by variations in blood pressure between the two techniques.<doc-sep>Patient satisfaction for carotid endarterectomy performed under local anaesthesia.<doc-sep>To develop, validate and use a procedure specific questionnaire to evaluate patient experience and satisfaction following carotid endarterectomy (CEA) under either general (GA) or local anaesthesia (LA).
                Twenty post-CEA patients were interviewed. Data were content analysed and recurrent themes used to generate the specific carotid endarterectomy experience questionnaire (CEA-EQ). The CEA-EQ consists of 15 pre-op and 13 postoperative questions. Validity was established by correlation with the FRS Patient Satisfaction with Surgical Services (SSSQ) and State form of the State Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI-S) in 69 patients (35 LA, 34 GA). Subsequently 88 patients randomised to GA CEA and 88 to LA CEA received the CEA-EQ. A local anaesthetic intraoperative experience questionnaire (LA-EQ) was also developed and given to LA patients only.
                Validity was confirmed through significant correlations with the STAI-S (r=0.67, p<0.001) and the SSSQ (r=0.44, p<0.001). In the randomised prospective study response rates were greater than 90%. Overall experience and satisfaction with CEA was high. There was no statistically significant difference in anxiety, satisfaction or overall experience between anaesthetic techniques. LA CEA was associated with a significantly better perception of recovery. The majority of LA patients found the procedure acceptable.
                The CEA-EQ is a valid tool to assess qualitative aspects of CEA patient care. Overall satisfaction and experience with CEA is good and not related to anaesthetic technique. LA CEA is not associated with any increased anxiety, is tolerated by the majority of patients and is associated with a better perception of recovery.<doc-sep>[Comparison of the influence of general and regional anesthesia on basic haemodynamic parameters during carotid endarterectomy].<doc-sep>Carotid endarterectomy (CEA) is a preventive operation to reduce the incidence of embolic and thrombotic cerebral stroke. CEA carries a significant perioeperartive mortality rate from stroke and myocardial infarction, which may even approach 5%. Thus, anesthetic and surgical techniques are constantly under scrutiny to try to reduce this relatively high incidence of morbidity and mortality. Anesthetic technique for CEA is divided to general (GA) and regional (RA) anesthesia, performed by cervical plexus block. The aim this study was to examine changes of basic haemodynamic parameters, which routinely fallows during CEA in condition of GA and RA. After obtaining institutional approval and informed consent, we randomized 50 patients scheduled for CEA (Tab. 1) in two groups (GA and RA). We fallow blood pressure: systolic (BPs), mean (BPm), diastolic (BPd), heart rate (HR), and RPP index at the examined patients. The examination performed in six control times: before induction of anesthesia (T1), 10 minutes after beginning of operation (T2), 5 minutes after cross clamping of arteria carotis (T3), 5 minutes after declamping arteria carotis (T4), 10 minutes (T5) and 2 hours after operation (T6). The results of study shows significant changes of blood pressure (BPs and BPm) and RPP index in T2 time in patinets undergoing GA. The changes occurred under influence of induction agent thiopental. These changes were in homeostatic range. In RA patinets, no haemodynamic changes registrated in control times. Therefore, from haemodynamic aspect RA was superior to GA.<doc-sep>Locoregional versus general anesthesia in carotid surgery: is there an impact on perioperative myocardial ischemia? Results of a prospective monocentric randomized trial.<doc-sep>The incidence of cardiac morbidity and mortality in patients who undergo carotid surgery ranges from 0.7% to 7.1%, but it still represents almost 50% of all perioperative complications. Because no data are available in literature about the impact of the anesthetic technique on such complications, a prospective randomized monocentric study was undertaken to evaluate the role of local anesthesia (LA) and general anesthesia (GA) on cardiac outcome.
                From November 1995 to February 1998, 107 patients were classified by the cardiologist as cardiac patients (IHD; history of myocardial infarction, previous myocardial revascularization procedures, or myocardial ischemia documented by means of positive electrocardiogram [ECG] stress test results) or noncardiac patients (NIHD; no history of chest pain or negative results for an ECG stress test). The patients were operated on after the randomization for the type of anesthesia (general or local). Continuous computerized 12-lead ECG was performed during the operative procedure and 24 hours postoperatively. The end points of the study were ECG modifications (upsloping or downsloping more than 2 mm) of the sinus tachycardia (ST) segment.
                Fifty-five patients were classified as IHD, and 52 were classified as NIHD. Twenty-seven of the 55 IHD patients (49%) and 24 of 52 NIHD patients (46%) were operated on under GA. Thirty-six episodes of myocardial ischemia occurred in 22 patients (20.5%). Episodes were slightly more frequent (58%) and longer in the postoperative period (intraoperative, 10 +/- 5 min; postoperative, 60 +/- 45 min; P <. 001). As expected, the prevalence of myocardial ischemia was higher in the group of cardiac patients than in noncardiac group (15 of 55 patients [27%] vs 7 of 52 patients [13%]; P <.02). By comparing the two anesthetic techniques in the overall population, we found a similar prevalence of patients who had myocardial ischemia (GA, 12 of 52 [23%]; LA, 10 of 55 [18%]; P = not significant) and a similar number of ischemic episodes per patient (GA, 1.5 +/- 0.4; LA, 1.8 +/- 0.6; P = not significant). Episodes of myocardial ischemia were similarly distributed in intraoperative and postoperative periods in both groups. It is relevant that under GA, IHD patients represent most of the population who suffered myocardial ischemia (83%). On the contrary, in the group of patients operated on under LA, the prevalence was equally distributed in the two subpopulations.
                The results confirm the different hemodynamic impact of the two anesthetic techniques. Patients who received LA had a rate of myocardial ischemia that was half that of patients who had GA. The small number of cardiac complications do not permit us to make any definitive conclusion on the impact of the two anesthetic techniques on early cardiac morbidity, but the relationship between perioperative ischemic burden and major cardiac events suggests that LA can be used safely, even in high-risk patients undergoing carotid endarterectomy.<doc-sep>General versus locoregional anesthesia in carotid surgery: a prospective randomised trial.<doc-sep>To evaluate the influence of anesthetic technique on perioperative neurological and cardiopulmonary complication rates in patients undergoing carotid endarterectomy.
                186 patients with symptomatic internal carotid artery (ICA) stenosis > 70% or asymptomatic ICA stenosis > 80% were prospectively randomized for either locoregional (LA) or general anesthesia (GA).
                Neurological complication rates were similar in both groups (GA 2% vs. LA 2%). Cardiopulmonary complication rates were not significantly different (GA 4% vs LA 1%). There were no stroke-related deaths, but one patient from the GA group died from severe postoperative pneumonia. Thus, a significant difference in combined stroke/cardiopulmonary related death between the two groups (GA 1% vs LA 0%) could not be found. However, perioperative cardiopulmonary monitoring showed that significantly more patients operated under general anesthesia had hypertensive events, with systolic blood pressure values greater than 180 mmHg on postoperative day one. There were no differences in the number of postoperatively hypotensive episodes (systolic blood pressure values < 100 mmHg) between the two groups.
                Significant differences in the perioperative neurological and cardiopulmonary complication rates between general and locoregional anesthesia in patients undergoing carotid endarterectomy could not be observed.<doc-sep>",,"There is no evidence that general anaesthesia is associated with a reduction in perioperative stroke, myocardial infarction, or pneumonia in patients undergoing carotid surgery.",CD000126

It is known that high dose carnitine activates surfactant synthesis. Given to women with imminent premature delivery, its benefit on the post natal period is proved. Own studies showed an increased need of carnitine during pregnancy. Therefore the questions rose if carnitine substitution improves placental insufficiency. 15 pregnant women were treated with 2 x 1 g carnitine orally for one week and with 1 x 1 g carnitine during the following 7 days when their fetus showed a retardation of 1-3 weeks. The control group were 15 untreated patients with the same problems of retardation. The placental insufficiency was diagnosed by fetometry, by blood parameters and the doppler ultrasound flow measurement. In the group of the treated patients 11 out of 15 showed an improvement, in 4 patients no effect of carnitine was seen and in 1 patient the retardation increased. In the control group 8 out of 15 patients showed a spontaneous improvement of fetal growth, 2 women did not have a change in their retardation and 5 patients had to be hospitalized because of increasing placental insufficiency. Inspite of the small number of patients a tendency towards a profit in carnitine treatment for placental insufficiency seems to be real.<doc-sep>[Therapy of suspected intrauterine fetal retardation].<doc-sep>In a randomized prospective study, performed on 45 pregnancies with clinical and sonographic suspicion for intrauterine fetal growth retardation, examinations were done to evaluate the therapeutic effect of bed rest and of additional daily administered glucose infusions or oral galactose applications respectively on the fetal growth, the hemodynamic, respiratory and endocrine insufficiency of the materno-feto-placental unit as well as selected biochemical parameters of the umbilical blood. There is no positive therapeutic effect, either on the impaired endocrine partial function nor on the reduced respiratory function of the feto-placental unit. It is obvious, that despite the improvement of the nutritional supply of the fetus and the revival of the regular fetal growth, the previous lack of fetal growth can not be altered. This can be demonstrated in all three therapeutic groups due to the fact of a resulting high hypotrophy-rate of the newborns. The results prove that the additional supply of the fetus with glucose or galactose does not remarkably improve the therapeutic effectivity as opposed by strict bed rest alone.<doc-sep>[Maternal blood and amniotic fluid insulin-like growth factor detection and amniotic cavity drug delivery for early diagnosis and management of fetal growth restriction].<doc-sep>To explore the relationship between insulin-like growth factors (IGFs) and fetal growth restriction (FGR) and early treatment of FGR.
                The levels of IGF-I and IGF-II were detected with radioimmunoassay in maternal blood and amniotic fluid samples of 44 pregnant women with FGR and 36 normal gravidas. The 44 gravidas with FGR were randomized into treatment group with amino acid by a pediatric administration to the amniotic cavity formula and control group with intravenous infusion of compound amino acid. The therapeutic effects were compared between the two groups on the basis of B-type ultrasound findings.
                Maternal blood IGF-I and amniotic fluid IGF-I and IGF-II levels in the pregnant women with FGR were significantly lower than those in normal gravidas (P<0.01). After therapy, IGF-I and IGF-II levels were significantly increased in the treatment group (P<0.01), but no obvious changes in IGF-I and IGF-II levels were observed in the control group (P>0.05). Compared with the control group, IGF-I and IGF-II levels increased significantly in the amniotic fluid in the treatment group, with also marked elevation of IGF-I levels in maternal blood (P<0.01). Better therapeutic effects were achieved in the treatment group than in the control group (P<0.01), and the birth weights of the neonates in the treatment group were basically normal.
                Detection of amniotic fluid IGF-I and IGF-II and maternal blood IGF-I can help predict the condition and facilitate early diagnosis of FGR. Injection of pediatric amino acid into the amniotic cavity can be effective for treatment of FGR.<doc-sep>",,There is insufficient evidence to support the routine use of carnitine for the treatment of intrauterine fetal retardation.,CD000148
9,"Antenatal phenobarbital therapy and neonatal outcome. I: Effect on intracranial hemorrhage.<doc-sep>To evaluate the effect of antenatal phenobarbital (PB) therapy on neonatal intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) in preterm infants.
                Prospective, randomized, controlled trial.
                Single institution study.
                Women in preterm labor ( < 35 weeks' gestation) were assigned to control and treatment groups. The treatment group received 10 mg/kg (maximum, 1000 mg) PB intravenously, followed by 100 mg orally daily, until delivery. Neonates did not receive PB after birth. Head sonograms were performed on days 3, 7, and 14 and at discharge. Hemorrhage was classified as mild, moderate, or severe by a single reader.
                Incidence of neonatal ICH in all infants, infants weighing less than 1250 g, and infants of multiple gestations.
                The study population comprised 110 women, 60 in the control group and 50 in the PB group. Neonates in the control group (n = 74, including 10 pairs of twins and 2 sets of triplets) were comparable to those in the treatment group (n = 62, including 7 pairs of twins, 1 set of triplets, and 1 set of quadruplets) regarding birth weight, gestational age, and other clinical risk factors for ICH. There was a trend for the incidence of any grade of hemorrhage to be lower in the PB group (22% [14 of 62]) compared with the control group (35% [26 of 74]). Moderate and severe hemorrhages were significantly lower in the PB group (1.6% [1 of 62]) compared with the control group (9.4% [7 of 74]). Among infants weighing less than 1250 g, overall ICH was lower in the PB group (23% [6 of 26]) compared with the control group (51% [18 of 35]). Among multiple-gestation infants, overall ICH was 4.7% (1 of 21) in the PB group, compared with 31% (8 of 26) in the control group.
                Antenatal PB therapy results in a significant decrease in moderate and severe ICH in infants born at less than 35 weeks' gestation. Antenatal PB therapy also resulted in a decrease in the incidence of all grades of ICH in infants weighing less than 1250 g and infants born of multiple gestations.<doc-sep>Antenatal phenobarbital for the prevention of periventricular and intraventricular hemorrhage: a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, multihospital trial.<doc-sep>To determine whether the neuroprotective properties of phenobarbital would alter the incidence and severity of intracranial hemorrhage in premature infants, we randomly assigned 110 women at less than 31 weeks of gestation to receive 10 mg/kg phenobarbital or placebo in a blinded fashion before delivery. Infants were examined postnatally with real-time ultrasonography for evidence of intracranial hemorrhage. Maternal demographics, pregnancy complications, antenatal management, and route of delivery did not differ between the phenobarbital group (n = 50) and the placebo group (n = 60). The total incidence of periventricular-intraventricular hemorrhage did not differ between the phenobarbital-treated (n = 54) and the placebo-treated (n = 67) infants. However, the frequency of grade 3 and grade 4 hemorrhages was 15% (10 infants) in the placebo group and 3.7% (2 infants) in the phenobarbital group (p less than 0.05). There were no differences in the severity of associated conditions in the babies to explain the difference in the incidence of severe hemorrhage between the study groups. We conclude that antenatal administration of phenobarbital appears to be effective in decreasing the severity of periventricular-intraventricular hemorrhage in infants delivered at less than 31 weeks of gestation.<doc-sep>Use of prenatal phenobarbital in the prevention of subependymal/intraventricular hemorrhage in premature infants.<doc-sep>Subependymal/intraventricular hemorrhage (SE/IVH) is a frequent cause of disability and mortality.
                This is a prospective, randomized, double-blind study which included 100 pregnant Mexican women who need to interrupt their pregnancy within 28-32 weeks of gestation. One group was given a single dose of intravenous (IV) phenobarbital 10 micrograms/kg (phenobarbital group, n = 50), and the other was provided with diluted distilled water (control group). Measurements of phenobarbital serum concentrations were taken by both mother and newborn, and head sonograms were applied during the first 24 hours, at the 3rd and 7th days of life.
                The sample was made up of 42 newborns in the phenobarbital group, and 46 in the control group; the newborns had phenobarbital levels of 11.5 5.7 g/microliter at birth, and of 9.5 +/- 5.9 g/microliter 24 hours later. SE/IVH was found in 12 patients from the phenobarbital group and in 29 from the control group (p < 0.005), the first group were 11 mild SE/IVH (2 grade I, and 9 grade II), and 26 in the control group (4 grade I, and 22 grade II), p < 0.005. Severe hemorrhages were similar between groups. A larger frequency of SE/IVH was found in the newborn group which received mechanical ventilation (p = 0.0008).
                Prenatal phenobarbital can reduce the SE/IVH frequency in premature infants younger than 32 weeks at birth. Its main effect could be shown in patients with mechanical ventilation.<doc-sep>Prevention of intraventricular hemorrhage in very low birth weight infants by maternally administered phenobarbital.<doc-sep>One hundred fifty pregnant women destined to deliver infants less than 32 weeks were randomly assigned to two groups. One group received phenobarbital in doses sufficient to achieve blood levels of 15 to 40 micrograms/mL, and this level was maintained in the neonate after birth. The second group received no antenatal treatment, but the infants were treated with phenobarbital after birth for at least four days. The infants were followed with ultrasound examinations of the head on postnatal days 1, 4, and 10 to assess the grade and progression of intraventricular hemorrhage. Intraventricular hemorrhage was significantly less frequent in the experimental group, 16 of 75 (21%) versus 35 of 75 (47%), P less than .01. Similarly, the experimental group had significantly fewer cases of severe intraventricular hemorrhage (grades III and IV), four of 75 (5%) versus 15 of 75 (20%), P less than .05 and mortality three of 75 (4%) versus ten of 75 (13%), P less than .05. Maternally administered phenobarbital appears to be effective in reducing the incidence of intraventricular hemorrhage and lessening its severity.<doc-sep>Antenatal phenobarbital and bilirubin metabolism in the very low birth weight infant.<doc-sep>Prior studies in term infants have suggested that in utero phenobarbital exposure may accelerate bilirubin metabolism by stimulating hepatocyte glucuronyl transferase activity. This report reviews our experience with maternal phenobarbital therapy and fetal bilirubin conjugation in the very premature fetus. Mothers with arrested premature labor between 26 and 33 weeks' gestation were randomly assigned to receive oral phenobarbital (90 mg daily) or not. Infants in the two groups were similar in race, birth weight, and gestational age. Conjugated bilirubin levels at birth were significantly higher for infants receiving several days of phenobarbital in utero than no therapy (0.31 +/- 0.03 vs 0.16 +/- 0.01 mg dl, p less than 0.01). A smaller portion of infants exposed to phenobarbital in utero required phototherapy (10/23, 43% vs 24/29, 83%, p less than 0.01), which was also more likely to be delayed beyond 48 hours after delivery. Antenatal phenobarbital enhances bilirubin conjugation before delivery of a very low birth weight infant.<doc-sep>Antepartum vitamin K and phenobarbital for preventing intraventricular hemorrhage in the premature newborn: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial.<doc-sep>To determine whether antepartum phenobarbital and vitamin K reduce the risk of intraventricular hemorrhage in premature newborns.
                Patients at imminent risk for spontaneous or indicated premature delivery between 24-34 weeks' gestation were randomized to receive either placebo or vitamin K and phenobarbital. All patients received betamethasone and antibiotics and were managed uniformly by a single perinatal group in one hospital. All newborns were managed uniformly in the same facility by a single neonatal group.
                There was a nonsignificant reduction in all grades of intraventricular hemorrhage in the treatment group when compared to the placebo group (48.2 versus 38.3%; P > .05). Frequencies were reduced for severe intraventricular hemorrhage (grades 3 and 4) (6.0 versus 2.5%; P > .05) and mild intraventricular hemorrhage (grades 1 and 2) (42.2 versus 35.8%; P > .05).
                Antepartum phenobarbital and vitamin K effected a nonsignificant reduction in both mild and severe intraventricular hemorrhage. The incidence of severe intraventricular hemorrhage in our control group was significantly less than that observed in previous studies.<doc-sep>Antenatal phenobarbital for the prevention of neonatal intracerebral hemorrhage.<doc-sep>Forty-six pregnant women less than 35 weeks of gestation were enrolled in a prospective randomized controlled study evaluating the effects of antenatal phenobarbital on neonatal intracerebral hemorrhage. The women were randomly assigned to control (n = 22) or treatment (n = 24) groups; the treatment group received 500 mg of phenobarbital intravenously. The time interval between the dose of phenobarbital and delivery was 5.5 +/- 4.8 hours (mean +/- SD). The infants in the control group (n = 23) and those in the phenobarbital-treated group (n = 25) were comparable regarding birth weight, gestational age, and other obstetric and neonatal risk factors associated with intracerebral hemorrhage. The incidence of intracerebral hemorrhage was 56.5% (13 of 23 infants) in the control group and 32% (eight of 25 infants) in the phenobarbital-treated group (p = 0.08). Moderate or severe hemorrhage was diagnosed in six of 13 control infants and in none of the phenobarbital-treated infants (p less than 0.01). The mortality rate was significantly lower in the phenobarbital-treated group (two of 25 infants) than in the control group (eight of 23 infants; p less than 0.05). Our study suggests that antenatal phenobarbital administration results in a decrease in mortality and in the severity of intracerebral hemorrhage in the preterm neonate.<doc-sep>Antenatal phenobarbital in preventing intraventricular hemorrhage in premature newborns.<doc-sep>In a randomized prospective study, we investigated the effect of antenatal phenobarbital on neonatal intraventricular hemorrhage in 39 women destined to deliver babies of less than 32 weeks of gestation.

10,"Adoption, reach and effectiveness of computer-based, practitioner delivered and combined smoking interventions in general medical practices: a three-arm cluster randomized trial.<doc-sep>Brief advice for smoking patients has not been sufficiently integrated in routine care. Computer-based interventions emerged as a time saving option that might help to exhaust the potential population impact of the general practice setting.
                151 practices were randomly assigned to one of three intervention programs consisting in the delivery of: (1) brief advice by the practitioner; (2) individually tailored computer-generated letters; or (3) a combination of both interventions. We assessed three dimensions of population impact: (1) adoption, i.e., the rate of practices participating in the program; (2) reach, measured as the number of interventions provided within 7 months; (3) effectiveness, measured as smoking abstinence at 12-months follow-up.
                Among the practices, 70% adopted the program with no significant differences across study groups. Treatment was provided to 3086 adult smokers. Negative binomial regression analysis revealed that the number of interventions provided was higher in practices allocated to the tailored letter and combination intervention groups by 215% (p<.01) and 127% (p=.02), respectively, compared to the brief advice intervention group. Among the patients who received the combination of both intervention, the odds of point abstinence from smoking was increased by 65% (p=.02) and 32% (p=.01) compared to the brief advice and tailored letters intervention respectively. Comparing the number of abstinent patients at follow-up revealed that the tailored letter and combination interventions were superior to the brief advice intervention.
                Computer-based interventions alone or in addition to conventional practitioner-delivered advice can foster the participation of general medical practices in tobacco control.

Four hundred and twenty-six male and 42 female clients were randomly assigned to an intervention group (I), and 413 males and 76 females were assigned to a control (C) group. The I group was given an approximately 2-minute smoking cessation instruction by physicians, answered a quiz concerning tobacco, chose their own behavioral goals and were handed a leaflet on how to quit smoking. Subjects in both groups responded to a self-administered questionnaire and a 6-month and 12-month follow-up was performed by post card or telephone. The I group received an encouragement card one month after instruction and abstainers of the I group were awarded a telephone card at the 6-month follow-up. The results were as follows: 1) The male I group exhibited 7.3% (6 months), 10.1% (12 months) abstinence rates and the male C group 4.4% (6 months), 5.3% (12 months), respectively. The difference in 12-month abstinence rates was statistically significant. 2) The female I group exhibited abstinence rates of 16.7% (6 months), 23.8% (12 months) and the female C group 14.5% (6 months), 17.1% (12 months), respectively. 3) A multivariate analysis of smoking cessation showed that lower nicotine dependency, strong determination for smoking cessation, and being female were significant factors for abstinence at the 6-month follow-up. At 12 months, the smoking cessation instruction also became a significant factor. These data suggest that a simple smoking cessation instruction at an annual physical examination was effective for general smokers.<doc-sep>The effectiveness of two smoking cessation programmes for use in general practice: a randomised clinical trial.<doc-sep>To evaluate a structured, behavioural change, smoking cessation intervention designed for use within general practice.
                Randomised controlled clinical trial.
                General practices in Newcastle, Australia.
                311 Patients identified as smokers by a screening question were enrolled in the study. Of these, 101 were assigned to a structured behavioural change programme, 104 to a simple advice programme adapted from previous research, and 106 to a control group. No significant differences were found between groups for demographic and smoking related variables before the study.
                Patients in the simple advice group received a brief statement of advice from the general practitioner as well as three pamphlets; those in the structured intervention group were given strategies which included attitude and behavioural change programmes as well as techniques to aid compliance. The amount of smoking in all groups was assessed by self reports with validation by measurement of salivary cotinine concentrations.
                Significant increase in cessation rates.
                Significant differences between controls and the structured behavioural change group were found at the one month follow up, but only for self reported abstinence. The simple advice programme did not produce any significant differences over the control group. General practitioner evaluation of the structured programme highlighted difficulties in relation to the duration of the intervention. Overall the structured programme in its present form did not appear to be an effective programme for use within general practice.<doc-sep>Effects of physician counseling on the smoking behavior of asbestos-exposed workers.<doc-sep>Physician antismoking advice has been shown to increase smoking cessation, particularly among patients who have medical problems or perceive themselves to be at risk. The present study tested three hypotheses: (a) providing 3 to 5 min of behavioral counseling regarding a cessation strategy would be more effective than simply warning the smoker to quit smoking; (b) smokers with abnormal pulmonary function would be more likely to comply with medical advice than would smokers with normal pulmonary function; and (c) that smokers with abnormal pulmonary function who receive behavioral counseling would be the group most likely to achieve prolonged abstinence. Asbestos-exposed smoking men undergoing screening in a mandated program for naval shipyard workers were categorized as having normal or abnormal pulmonary status on the basis of chest X ray and pulmonary function tests (PFT). They were then randomly assigned within PFT categories to receive either a simple warning or 3 to 5 min of behavioral cessation counseling from the physician who gave them the results of their pulmonary tests. Subjects' smoking status was evaluated at 3- and 11-month intervals following the physician intervention. Smokers who received behavioral counseling were more likely to quit and remain abstinent over the 11-month period (8.4% abstinent) than were smokers given a minimal warning (3.6% abstinent). Prolonged abstinence rates among abnormal PFT subjects (3.7%) did not differ from those of normals (5.9%). The group with normal PFT who received behavioral counseling achieved the highest level of abstinence (9.5%). Maintaining adequate physician compliance with the counseling protocol proved difficult; implications of this for future efforts are discussed.<doc-sep>Anti-smoking advice for young diabetic smokers: is it a waste of breath?<doc-sep>The effect of health counselling on the smoking habits of 60 diabetic patients (aged less than 40 years) was assessed. Measurement of breath carbon monoxide (CO) and urinary cotinine, a metabolite of nicotine, were used as objective markers of smoking. All patients wished to cease smoking and the impact of health counselling was reviewed in a 'Stop Smoking' clinic. In addition to routine advice on the health hazards of smoking, half the patients and their families also received further counselling during a home visit by a health visitor. After 6 months many of the 60 patients claimed to have reduced their cigarette consumption. However, the urinary cotinine concentrations did not confirm this. Only one patient actually stopped smoking and he had sustained a myocardial infarction during the study. There was a small but significant reduction of breath CO in the patients seen at home by the health visitor but the urinary cotinine concentrations were unchanged. This suggests that these patients abstained from smoking for only a few hours before attending the 'Stop Smoking' clinic.<doc-sep>Nicotine chewing gum in general practice: effect of follow up appointments.<doc-sep>Two hundred smokers who were judged by their general practitioner to be motivated to stop smoking were allocated to one of two groups. All were offered an initial appointment at which they were advised to stop smoking and offered nicotine gum. One group then received no further appointments. The other was offered four further appointments over three months. Both groups were followed up at six and 12 months. At one year follow up 15.5% overall had stopped smoking, 14% in the low and 17% in the high contact group. This is better than most results so far reported for nicotine chewing gum in general practice, suggesting that general practitioners can use it to good effect. We compare this result with others achieved in general practice.<doc-sep>Smoking cessation at the workplace. Results of a randomised controlled intervention study. Worksite physicians from the AIREL group.<doc-sep>To compare the effects of a worksite intervention by the occupational physician offering simple advice of smoking cessation with a more active strategy of advice including a ""quit date"" and extra support.
                Employees of an electrical and gas company seen at the annual visit by their occupational physicians. CRITERIA END POINTS: Smoking point prevalence defined as the percentage of smokers who were non-smokers at one year. Secondary criteria were the percentage of smokers who stopped smoking for more than six months and the difference in prevalence of smoking in both groups.
                Randomised controlled trial. The unit of randomisation was the work site physician and a random sample of the employees of whom he or she was in charge. The length of the follow up was one year. Each of 30 work site physicians included in the study 100 to 150 employees.
                Among 504 subjects classified as smokers at baseline receiving simple advice (group A) and 591 the more active programme (group B), 68 (13.5%) in group A and 109 (18. 4%) were non-smokers one year later (p=0.03; p=0.01 taking the occupational physician as the statistical unit and using a non-parametric test). Twenty three subjects (4.6%) in group A and 36 (6.1%) in group B (p=0.26) declared abstinence of six months or more. Among non-smokers at baseline, 3.4% in both groups were smokers after one year follow up. The prevalence of smokers did not differ significantly at baseline (32.9% and 32.4%, p=0.75). After the intervention the prevalence of smoking was 30.8% in group A and 28. 7% in group B (p=0.19). An increase of the mean symptoms score for depression in those who quit was observed during this period.
                A simple cessation intervention strategy during a mandatory annual examination, targeting a population of smokers independently of their motivation to stop smoking or their health status, showed a 36% relative increase of the proportion of smokers who quit smoking as compared with what can be achieved through simple advice.<doc-sep>A randomised controlled trial of the effect on middle-aged men of advice to stop smoking.<doc-sep>A randomised controlled trial of smoking cessation is reported in 1445 male smokers aged 40-59 at high risk of cardiorespiratory disease. The 714 men in the intervention group were recalled for a series of personal interviews with a doctor. After one year, 51% of the intervention group reported that they were not smoking any cigarettes, and most of the others reported a reduction. Compared with the ""normal care"" group, the men in the intervention group showed a decline in the prevalence of sputum production and dyspnoea; ventilatory function did not improve but its rate of decline was significantly slowed. There were no evident effects on blood pressure levels, nor on electrocardiographic findings over three years, nor on sickness absence over one year. Mortality follow-up has continued for an average of 7.9 years; 98 (13.7%) of the intervention group have died, compared with 94 (12.9%) of the ""normal care"" group. The 95% confidence limits on mortality range from 2.63% in favour of intervention to 4.37% in favour of normal care. The power of the trial has been reduced by smoking cessation in the ""normal care"" group. It is concluded that smoking cessation in these middle-aged men improved the symptoms and progress of chronic bronchitis; but the reversibility of the risk of cigarettes to the smoker's life may have been overestimated in observational studies.<doc-sep>""Sick of Smoking"": evaluation of a targeted minimal smoking cessation intervention in general practice.<doc-sep>Several smoking intervention studies have been conducted overseas which use a minimal amount of general practitioners' time and are conducted within the constraints of a normal consultation. However, there are no published reports of minimal interventions in Australian general practice. This study reports on 1238 South Australian smokers who were assigned to a non-intervention control group or a group which received firm general practitioner advice to quit smoking plus literature. At one-year follow-up, 7.5% of smokers in the minimal advice group who had quit for six or more months remained non-smokers compared with 3.2% in the control group. If similar analytical procedures had been used in this study as were used in the benchmark study in England in 1979, the quit rate for this study would have been 11.3% in the intervention group, and 4.8% in the control group--a net gain of 6.5%. These results are discussed with regard to widespread implementation in Australian general practice.<doc-sep>Smoking cessation in family practice: the effects of advice and nicotine chewing gum prescription.<doc-sep>The efficacy of physician anti-smoking intervention with 289 patients in a family practice setting was assessed. The design included two treatment conditions, physician advice and physician advice plus the offer of nicotine chewing gum (NCG) prescription. A no-advice group permitted assessment of the effects of repeated testing. The NCG group had higher rates of abstinence at all follow-up points, but the difference approached statistical significance at 3 months only (p less than .10). Comparison of those who actually used NCG to all other groups revealed significantly more users were abstinent at 1- and 3-month follow-up. A similar pattern occurred for proportion attempting cessation and smoking reduction. A dose-response relationship of gum use to outcome was identified. Long-term users (greater than 20 days) had 86% abstinence at 3 months versus 18% for short-term users. Thus, NCG does appear to have a role in family practice for promoting short-term cessation.<doc-sep>Evaluation of a minimal-contact smoking cessation intervention in an outpatient setting.<doc-sep>We examined the ability of a provider-initiated, minimal-contact intervention to modify the smoking behavior of ambulatory clinic patients. Smokers at two outpatient sites were assigned to one of three groups: provider intervention only (PI); provider intervention plus self-help manual (PI/M); and usual care (control) group (C). The physician message emphasized the patient's personal susceptibility, the physician's concern, and the patient's ability to quit (self-efficacy). The nurse consultation concentrated on benefits and barriers associated with stopping, and on strategies for cessation. Telephone interviews were conducted with the 250 participants within a few days of their clinic visit and again at one and six months. Both PI and PI/M proved to be superior to usual care in motivating attempts to quit at both one-month and six-month follow-ups, and logistic regression analyses indicated that participants receiving the self-help manual in addition to the health provider message were between two and three times more likely to quit smoking during the study period than were participants in either of the other study groups.<doc-sep>Proactive interventions for smoking cessation in general medical practice: a quasi-randomized controlled trial to examine the efficacy of computer-tailored letters and physician-delivered brief advice.<doc-sep>To test the efficacy of (i) computer-generated tailored letters and (ii) practitioner-delivered brief advice for smoking cessation against an assessment-only condition; and to compare both interventions directly.
                Quasi-randomized controlled trial.
                A total of 34 randomly selected general practices from a German region (participation rate 87%).
                A total of 1499 consecutive patients aged 18-70 years with daily cigarette smoking (participation rate 80%).
                The tailored letters intervention group received up to three individualized personal letters. Brief advice was delivered during routine consultation by the practitioner after an onsite training session. Both interventions were based on the Transtheoretical Model of behaviour change.
                Self-reported point prevalence and prolonged abstinence at 6-, 12-, 18- and 24-month follow-ups.
                Among participants completing the last follow-up, 6-month prolonged abstinence was 18.3% in the tailored letters intervention group, 14.8% in the brief advice intervention group and 10.5% in the assessment-only control group. Assuming those lost to follow-up to be smokers, the rates were 10.2%, 9.7% and 6.7%, respectively. Analyses including all follow-ups confirmed statistically significant effects of both interventions compared to assessment only. Using complete case analysis, the tailored letters intervention was significantly more effective than brief advice for 24-hour [odds ratio (OR) = 1.4; P = 0.047] but not for 7-day point prevalence abstinence (OR = 1.4; P = 0.068) for prolonged abstinence, or for alternative assumptions about participants lost to follow-up.
                The study demonstrated long-term efficacy of low-cost interventions for smoking cessation in general practice. The interventions are suitable to reach entire populations of general practices and smoking patients. Computer-generated letters are a promising option to overcome barriers to provide smoking cessation counselling routinely.<doc-sep>Smoking cessation in patients: two further studies by the British Thoracic Society. Research Committee of the British Thoracic Society.<doc-sep>The effects of various smoking cessation strategies were studied in two multicentre trials with new patients attending hospital or a chest clinic because of a smoking related disease. In the first trial (study A, 1462 patients) the effect of the physician's usual advice to stop smoking was compared with the effect of the same advice reinforced by a signed agreement to stop smoking by a target date within the next week, two visits by a health visitor in the first six weeks, and a series of letters of encouragement from the physician. The second trial (study B, 1392 patients) compared (1) advice only, (2) advice supplemented by a signed agreement, (3) advice supplemented by a series of letters of encouragement, and (4) advice supplemented by a signed agreement and a series of letters of encouragement. Patients were reviewed at six months and those claiming to have stopped smoking were seen again at 12 months. Claims of abstinence were checked by carboxyhaemoglobin measurement. In study A 9% of the intervention group had succeeded in stopping smoking at six months compared with 7% of the ""advice only"" patients (p = 0.17). In study B success rates were 5.2%, 4.9%, 8.5%, and 8.8% respectively. The signed agreement did not influence outcome, whereas postal encouragement increased the effect of the physician's advice. In both studies patients reviewed clinically between the initial and the six month visit were more likely to stop smoking than those not reviewed. Success rates increased with age and men tended to do better than women. The studies suggest that physician's advice alone will persuade 5% of outpatients with a smoking related disease to stop smoking. Subsequent postal encouragement will increase the cessation rate by more than half as much again. Such small improvements in success rates are worth while, especially if they can be achieved cheaply and on a wide scale.<doc-sep>Brief physician-initiated quit-smoking strategies for clinical oncology settings: a trial coordinated by the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group.<doc-sep>Although tobacco use by cancer patients increases the risk of relapse, diminishes treatment efficacy, and worsens quality of life, about one third of patients who smoked before their diagnosis continue to smoke. Because patients have regular contact with oncologists, the efficacy of a physician-based smoking cessation treatment was evaluated.
                Cancer patients (n = 432) were randomly assigned to either usual care or a National Institutes of Health (NIH) physician-based smoking intervention. The primary outcome was 7-day point prevalence abstinence at 6 and 12 months after study entry.
                At the 6-month follow-up, there was no significant difference in quit rates between the usual care (11.9%) and intervention (14.4%) groups, and there was no significant difference between the usual care (13.6%) and intervention (13.3%) groups at the 12-month follow-up. Patients were more likely to have quit smoking at 6 months if they had head and neck or lung cancer, began smoking after the age of 16, reported at baseline using a cessation self-help guide or treatment in the last 6 months, and showed greater baseline desire to quit. Patients were more likely to have quit smoking at 12 months if they smoked 15 or fewer cigarettes per day, had head and neck or lung cancer, tried a group cessation program, and showed greater baseline desire to quit. Finally, there was greater adherence among physicians to the NIH model for physician smoking treatment for patients in the intervention versus the usual care group.
                While training physicians to provide smoking cessation treatment to cancer patients can enhance physician adherence to clinical practice guidelines, physician smoking cessation interventions fail to yield significant gains in long-term quit rates among cancer patients.<doc-sep>Three year evaluation of a programme by general practitioners to help patients to stop smoking.<doc-sep>A controlled study was undertaken to measure the effectiveness of general practitioners' use of an intensive programme to help patients to stop smoking. Two hundred cigarette smokers who attended a general practice were allocated to either a treatment (n = 100) or a non-intervention control (n = 100) group. After the initial visit treatment consisted of an educational consultation and four follow up visits. Smoking state was assessed biochemically at six months and three years. Thirty five patients in the treatment group were abstinent at three years compared with eight in the control group (p less than 0.001). Sixty four patients attended the educational consultation and first follow up visit; of these, 45 were not smoking at the first follow up visit, 30 maintained abstinence up to six months, and 22 were still not smoking after three years. Among the 37 patients who completed the treatment programme and attended all the follow up visits 57% were abstinent at three years. The results of this study suggest that general practitioners can help patients to stop smoking.<doc-sep>A randomized trial of smoking cessation interventions in general practice in Italy.<doc-sep>The purpose of this study was to examine the effectiveness of different practice-based approaches to assist patients of primary care physicians to quit smoking and sustain cessation. Forty-four nonsmoking general practitioners volunteered for the study. After a period of training, they randomized 923 smoking clients, unselected for motivation toward quitting, to four different intervention groups: (i) minimal intervention, consisting of one single counselling session and a brief handout on quitting techniques; (ii) repeated counselling including reinforcing sessions at Months 1, 3, 6, and 9; (iii) repeated counselling and use of nicotine gum; and (iv) repeated counselling and spirometry. Biochemically validated smoking status was assessed at six and 12 months after recruitment. The proportion of verified quitters at 12 months was 4.8 percent among subjects randomized to the minimal intervention group, compared to 5.5 percent, 7.5 percent, and 6.5 percent among those randomized to the three repeated-counselling groups. In no treatment group was the outcome significantly different from that for one-time counselling at the (P less than 0.05) level. Lack of power, contamination, and low attendance at reinforcing sessions should be taken into account in interpreting the results.<doc-sep>Reaching midlife and older smokers: tailored interventions for routine medical care.<doc-sep>Although older adults can achieve significant health benefits from smoking cessation, few programs have specifically targeted this population. This study tested the effectiveness of an office-based smoking cessation program tailored to midlife and older smokers.
                This paper describes a randomized controlled trial comparing usual care with physician-delivered brief quit-smoking advice and counseling for midlife and older smokers (ages 50-74). Outpatient medical practices assigned to the Immediate Intervention (experimental) condition were trained to deliver brief quit-smoking advice and counseling. Delayed Intervention (control) practices followed usual care procedures. Thirty-nine practices accruing five or more patients per practice were included in the analyses.
                Using conservative measure of quitting, self-reported quit rates at 6-month follow-up were 15.41% for the Immediate Intervention group versus 8.16% of subjects in the Delayed Intervention group (P < 0.005). Baseline subject (N = 659) characteristics related to 6-month abstinence included number of previous quit attempts, quitting for 24 hr in the past year, desire to quit, confidence in quitting, perceived health benefits, and lower nicotine dependence.
                Smoking abstinence was significantly increased by training physicians and key office and clinical staff to intervene with older smokers. Brief interventions are tailored to this age cohort can be successfully and efficaciously integrated into routine care.<doc-sep>Is smoking intervention in general practice more successful among pregnant than non-pregnant women?<doc-sep>The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of a simple smoking intervention programme, carried out by a large number of general practitioners (GPs) among pregnant and non-pregnant women. Four groups of women were defined by the dichotomies pregnant versus non-pregnant and intervention versus control. The intervention was semistructured, using a flip-over and a booklet, and it was implemented in an ordinary sequence of consultations. The study involved 187 GPs in western Norway. The subjects were 350 daily smoking pregnant women and 274 daily smoking non-pregnant women, 18-34 years of age. The point prevalence abstinence rate at 18 months was 15 and 20% for pregnant and non-pregnant women, respectively, in the intervention groups, and 7% in the control groups (Ppregnant = 0.06, Pnon-pregnant = 0.006). Twenty-five per cent of the pregnant women and 34% of the non-pregnant women reported that they had reduced their cigarette consumption, but had not stopped smoking entirely. If we include all drop-outs as smokers, the continuous abstinence rate during 15 months was 6%/0% among pregnant women (intervention/control) and 5%/1% among non-pregnant women. Stopping smoking was associated with having a non-smoking partner (P = 0.001), and being encouraged to do so by their partner (P = 0.004). The prevalence of both pregnant and non-pregnant women who stopped smoking was higher in the intervention than in the control groups. Pregnant women stopped smoking as frequently as non-pregnant individuals.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)<doc-sep>Effects of nicotine chewing gum and follow-up appointments in physician-based smoking cessation.<doc-sep>The effect of different follow-up programs reinforced or not reinforced with the nicotine chewing gum Nicorette was tested by 13 physicians working in the open health care system. A total of 151 patients were advised to stop smoking, and were asked to participate in the program if judged sufficiently motivated by the physicians. After inclusion they were randomized into short or long follow-up, and nicotine gum vs no gum. The physicians conducted the follow-up therapy in their own personal way. Short follow-up was comprised of one appointment 14 days after cessation, while long follow-up consisted of a telephone call (1 week), an appointment (2 weeks), a second appointment (1 month), and a letter (3 months). The results at 12 months were that long follow-up showed a trend (P less than 0.12 toward being better than short follow-up, while nicotine gum was significantly better than no gum (P less than 0.05) in maintaining abstinence. The group with the best outcome was the one receiving long follow-up and nicotine gum, which yielded an expired air carbon monoxide-controlled, 12-month abstinence rate of 27%. The abstinence outcomes at 12 months for the other groups were short follow-up and nicotine gum, 22%; long follow-up and no gum, 15%; and short follow-up and no gum, 3%. The physicians' reactions to the smoking cessation treatment were largely positive. The nicotine gum seems to be a relatively simple, cost-effective, and practical tool for physicians to enhance and reinforce their antismoking advice. With a longer active follow-up period than was used here (1 month), even better results may be possible.<doc-sep>Controlled trial of three different antismoking interventions in general practice.<doc-sep>Of 6052 adult patients who consulted their doctors in six Oxfordshire general practices between October 1980 and February 1981, 2110 (35%) were smokers. The smokers were allocated to one of four study groups--a control (non-intervention) group; a group that received verbal and written antismoking advice from the general practitioner; a group that received this advice and also a demonstration of exhaled carbon monoxide; and a group that received the advice plus the offer of further help from a health visitor. After one year 72% of smokers replied to a postal follow up questionnaire: 11% of the control group claimed to have stopped smoking compared with 15% in the group that received advice alone, 17% in the exhaled carbon monoxide group, and 13% in the health visitor group. Validation of these findings by assays of urinary concentrations of cotinine showed that between 24% and 40% of subjects may have misreported their smoking habits, but there was no indication that the rate of misreporting was higher in the intervention groups than in the control group. Giving advice routinely against smoking has a useful effect, and showing an immediate, personal, and potentially harmful consequence of smoking using a CO-oximeter may improve this, particularly in lower socioeconomic groups.<doc-sep>The impact of physicians' brief smoking cessation counseling: a MIRNET study.<doc-sep>Although many family physicians may discuss smoking cessation with their patients, few do so consistently. A common belief among many physicians is that such efforts will not deter their patients from smoking. Others believe the time commitment required for a successful intervention is excessive. The present study addressed the above issues by examining the effect of a 3- to 5-minute unstructured physician discussion encouraging smoking cessation with family practice patients. Cigarette-smoking patients of two busy family practices in southeast Michigan were randomly assigned to either a control group receiving routine care or an intervention group receiving, in addition to routine care, smoking cessation counseling from their physician. A third comparison group was drawn from smokers in practices not involved in delivering the intervention. Two hundred thirty-eight patients from the intervention group, 178 from the control group, and 47 from the comparison group were followed up with a telephone interview at 6 months. Intervention group patients made significantly more quit attempts than did those in the control group (P less than .001), which was similar to the comparison group. At the 6-month follow-up, 8% of intervention group members, and 4% of both the comparison and control groups reportedly were abstinent from smoking. Among those contacted at the 1-year follow-up, the respective percentages abstinent were 8%, 3%, and 4%. Although these differences in quit rates were not statistically significant, the findings suggest that physicians can positively affect patient smoking cessation. This intervention was feasible in busy family practices, highlighting its generalizability and applicability to other family practice settings in the United States.<doc-sep>Reducing maternal smoking and relapse: long-term evaluation of a pediatric intervention.<doc-sep>Pediatric well-care visits provide a clinical opportunity to counsel new mothers about their smoking and the deleterious effects of environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) on infant health.
                Forty-nine Oregon pediatric offices enrolled 2,901 women who were currently smoking or had quit for pregnancy, using a brief survey at the newborn's first office visit. Randomly assigned offices provided advice and materials to mothers at each well-care visit during the first 6 months postpartum to promote quitting or relapse prevention.
                The intervention reduced smoking (5.9% vs 2.7%) and relapse (55% vs 45%) at 6-month follow-up, but logistic regression analysis at 12 months revealed no significant treatment effect. The intervention had a positive effect on secondary outcome variables, such as readiness to quit and attitude toward and knowledge of ETS. Multiple logistic regression analysis indicated that husband/partner smoking was the strongest predictor of maternal quitting or relapse.
                A pediatric office-based intervention can significantly affect smoking and relapse prevention for mothers of newborns, but the effect decreases with time. Consistent prompting of the provider to give brief advice and materials at well-care visits could provide a low-cost intervention to reduce infant ETS exposure.<doc-sep>A family physician smoking cessation program: an evaluation of the role of follow-up visits.<doc-sep>Our purpose in this randomized clinical trial was to compare a two-visit smoking cessation intervention by family physicians with the same intervention supplemented by additional follow-ups. Forty-one southern Ontario family physicians volunteered for the study and subsequently participated in a four-hour training program on smoking cessation techniques. Physicians advised patients who smoked and indicated an interest in attempting to quit with the help of their physician to stop smoking at the end of a regularly scheduled visit. Physicians instructed patients to make a specific appointment for an evaluation of their smoking habits. Six hundred forty-seven patients returned for that assessment and were than randomized into either the two-visit intervention group (with risk assessment, support, the setting of a cessation date, self-help literature, and a prescription for nicotine gum, where appropriate) or into the other intervention group (with the same maneuvers as well as the offer of four more supportive follow-up visits). We found no statistically significant difference in one-year, biochemically validated, sustained cessation rates between the group offered the long-term follow-up visits (12.5%) and the group given the brief intervention (10.2%). The 95% confidence interval on the difference between the groups was 2.8% in favor of the brief intervention group to 7.3% in favor of the group offered follow-up. The results do not support the value of long-term follow-up visits for smokers.<doc-sep>Facilitating autonomous motivation for smoking cessation.<doc-sep>Physicians used either an autonomy-supportive or a controlling interpersonal style to counsel smokers based on National Cancer Institute guidelines. Physician autonomy support was rated from audiotapes, and patients' perceived competence and autonomous motivation for quitting were self-reported on questionnaires. Validated point prevalences for 6, 12, and 30 months and for continuous cessation were examined. The intervention did not have a direct effect on quit rates; however, structural equation modeling supported the self-determination process model of smoking cessation. The model indicated that the autonomy-supportive intervention was rated as more autonomy supportive, that rated autonomy support predicted autonomous motivation, and that autonomous motivation predicted cessation at all points in time. Perceived competence contributed independent variance to cessation only at 6 months.<doc-sep>Randomized controlled trial of a computer-based, tailored intervention to increase smoking cessation counseling by primary care physicians.<doc-sep>The primary care visit represents an important venue for intervening with a large population of smokers. However, physician adherence to the Smoking Cessation Clinical Guideline (5As) remains low. We evaluated the effectiveness of a computer-tailored intervention designed to increase smoking cessation counseling by primary care physicians.
                Physicians and their patients were randomized to either intervention or control conditions. In addition to brief smoking cessation training, intervention physicians and patients received a one-page report that characterized the patients' smoking habit and history and offered tailored recommendations. Physician performance of the 5As was assessed via patient exit interviews. Quit rates and smoking behaviors were assessed 6 months postintervention via patient phone interviews. Intervention effects were tested in a sample of 70 physicians and 518 of their patients. Results were analyzed via generalized and mixed linear modeling controlling for clustering.
                Intervention physicians exceeded controls on ""Assess"" (OR 5.06; 95% CI 3.22, 7.95), ""Advise"" (OR 2.79; 95% CI 1.70, 4.59), ""Assist-set goals"" (OR 4.31; 95% CI 2.59, 7.16), ""Assist-provide written materials"" (OR 5.14; 95% CI 2.60, 10.14), ""Assist-provide referral"" (OR 6.48; 95% CI 3.11, 13.49), ""Assist-discuss medication"" (OR 4.72;95% CI 2.90, 7.68), and ""Arrange"" (OR 8.14; 95% CI 3.98, 16.68), all p values being < 0.0001. Intervention patients were 1.77 (CI 0.94, 3.34,p = 0.078) times more likely than controls to be abstinent (12 versus 8%), a difference that approached, but did not reach statistical significance, and surpassed controls on number of days quit (18.4 versus 12.2, p < .05) but not on number of quit attempts.
                The use of a brief computer-tailored report improved physicians' implementation of the 5As and had a modest effect on patients' smoking behaviors 6 months postintervention.<doc-sep>The impact of routine advice on smoking cessation from family physicians.<doc-sep>Cigarette smoking continues to be a major health problem. Therefore, physicians have been asked to advise all their patients on the hazards of smoking. A controlled trial was undertaken to measure the impact of family physicians' advice to cigarette smokers during a routine office visit. No significant differences were found in the three measures used to determine outcome--desire to stop smoking, an attempt to stop and success in stopping--between the control and intervention groups. These results are discussed in relation to the health belief model, and suggestions are made on how to increase the impact family physicians could have on smoking cessation to their practices.<doc-sep>Randomized clinical trial of supportive follow-up for cigarette smokers in a family practice.<doc-sep><doc-sep>Smoking prevention among people aged 60 and over: a randomized controlled trial.<doc-sep>This study aimed to test the hypothesis that people aged 60 and older respond to assistance in stopping smoking.

The proportions of quitters after a year was 5.3% and 2.3% in each group (p less than 0.05). Among the variables related to success in quitting are self-reliance, the willingness to reduce or quit smoking, the intensity of the habit and the family environment.<doc-sep>Effect of nicotine chewing gum as an adjunct to general practitioner's advice against smoking.<doc-sep>This study was designed to see whether the offer and prescription of nicotine chewing gum would enhance the efficacy of general practitioners' advice to stop smoking. A sample of 1938 cigarette smokers who attended the surgeries of 34 general practitioners in six group practices were assigned by week of attendance (in a balanced design) to one of three groups: (a) non-intervention controls, (b) advice plus booklet, and (c) advice plus booklet plus the offer of nicotine gum. Follow up was done after four months and one year. The results show a clear advantage for those offered the nicotine gum (p less than 0.001). After correction for those who refused or failed chemical validation and those who switched from cigarettes to a pipe or cigars, the proportions who were abstinent at four months and still abstinent at one year were 3.9%, 4.1%, and 8.8% in the three groups, respectively. These percentages are based on all cigarette smokers who attended the surgeries including those who did not wish to stop and those in the gum group who did not try the gum (47%). The effect of the offer and prescription of gum was to motivate more smokers to try to stop, to increase the success rate among those who tried, and to reduce the relapse rate of those who stopped. The self selected subgroup of 8% who used more than one box of 105 pieces of gum achieved a success rate of 24%. It would be feasible and effective for general practitioners to include the offer of nicotine gum and brief instructions on its use as part of a minimal intervention routine with all cigarette smokers. A general practitioner who adopts such a routine with similar success could expect to achieve about 35-40 long term ex-smokers a year and so save the lives of about 10 of them. If replicated by all general practitioners throughout the country the yield of ex-smokers would be about one million a year.<doc-sep>Smoking cessation in patients with COPD in daily general practice (SMOCC): six months' results.<doc-sep>Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) forms an increasing health problem. Despite smoking cessation improving the prognosis of the disease, many patients persist smoking. The present study presents the results of a smoking cessation counseling protocol in general practice (Smoking Cessation in patients with COPD in general practice (SMOCC)).
                A randomized controlled trial of patients with COPD compared smoking cessation counseling according to an intensified minimal intervention strategy with usual care. In total 43 general practices with 392 patients participated in Nijmegen, The Netherlands, in 2001-2002.
                Significantly more smokers in the experimental group made a quit attempt (44.9% versus 36.5%) and actually quit smoking than in the control group (16.0% versus 8.8%). The motivation to stop smoking at baseline was not associated with smoking cessation.
                The SMOCC strategy doubled the self-reported quit rates and was complied well by the general practitioners. Implementation in general practice is recommended.<doc-sep>Effectiveness of a minimal contact smoking cessation program for Dutch general practitioners: a randomized controlled trial.<doc-sep>Until recently, Dutch general practitioners contributed little to tobacco control. This is due to several factors, among which is the lack of a feasible intervention program for adult smokers. Such a minimal contact behavioral intervention, using the Stage-of-Change concept, is now available. Effectiveness was tested in a randomized trial.
                Twenty-two general practitioners and their practice assistants were trained in applying the program. In all, 530 smoking patients were enrolled, randomly assigned to either the intervention or the usual treatment condition. Analysis of treatment effects was performed with logistic regression analysis. In a backward stepwise procedure confounding effects of baseline differences were eliminated.
                At 12-month follow-up, self-reported abstinence rates (including nonrespondents as smokers) differed significantly between intervention subjects and controls: 13.4 vs 7.3% point prevalence (odds ratio 1.51, P < 0.05). An analysis of consecutive abstinence, defined as being abstinent at both 6- and 12-month follow-up, showed that 8.2% of the intervention group compared to 3.1% of the controls had sustained abstinence for more than 6 months (odds ratio 3.04, P < 0.001).
                Results indicate that an effective smoking cessation program for use in Dutch general practice, already shown to be feasible, is now available. Outcomes are generally consistent with recent international literature.

The interventions tested were 1) physician counseling, 2) mailed letters and educational materials designed by the National Cancer Institute (NCI), and 3) referral to smoking cessation classes. Thirty-seven family practice physicians at three of Group Health's outpatient facilities participated. Patient participation rates were 95%, and follow-up was complete for 92% of those participating. None of the interventions had any effect on point prevalence of quitting as determined 8-9 months later by self-report. However, the combination of physician counseling and NCI materials doubled the odds of occurrence of significant antismoking behavior (quit, quit and relapse, or cut down) during the ensuing 8-9 months in those individuals receiving that combination. Referral to smoking cessation classes was strikingly ineffective in this setting. Of 369 individuals designated by study design for referral, only 14% even investigated the classes. This compares with a 10% self-referral rate for those persons not designated for referral by our study design. Our results and other recent work suggest that more intensive interventions on multiple occasions based on relapse prevention strategies hold promise for future success in smoking cessation efforts in primary care.<doc-sep>",,There is insufficient evidence to support the use of pharmacological interventions to promote smoking cessation in the general medical practice setting.,CD000165
11,"Indobufen versus warfarin in the secondary prevention of major vascular events in nonrheumatic atrial fibrillation. SIFA (Studio Italiano Fibrillazione Atriale) Investigators.<doc-sep>The results of a large prospective randomized trial have shown the efficacy of oral anticoagulation in the secondary prevention of major vascular events in patients with nonrheumatic atrial fibrillation (NRAF); less well established is the role of antiplatelet agents. The present study compared the effects of indobufen, a reversible inhibitor of platelet cyclooxygenase, with those of warfarin in this setting.
                A total of 916 patients with NRAF and a recent (< or = 15 days) cerebral ischemic episode were admitted to this multicenter, randomized study, during which they were treated with either indobufen (100 or 200 mg BID) or warfarin (to obtain an international normalized ratio of 2.0 to 3.5) for 12 months. The two groups (462 on indobufen and 454 on warfarin) were well balanced in terms of their main baseline characteristics. The primary outcome of the study was the combined incidence of nonfatal stroke (including intracerebral bleeding), pulmonary or systemic embolism, nonfatal myocardial infarction, and vascular death.
                At the end of follow-up, the incidence of primary outcome events was 10.6% in the indobufen group (95% confidence interval, 7.7% to 13.5%) and 9.0% in the warfarin group (95% confidence interval, 6.3% to 11.8%), with no statistically significant difference between treatments. The frequency of noncerebral major bleeding complications was low: only four cases (0.9%) of gastrointestinal bleeding were observed, all of them in the warfarin group.
                We conclude that, within the limitations of its design, this study may help the medical community in devising appropriate antithrombotic strategies for NRAF patients for whom oral anticoagulants are contraindicated or do not represent a feasible approach to treatment.<doc-sep>",,There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of anticoagulants in the treatment of NRAF.,CD000187
12,"Abu Dhabi third stage trial: oxytocin versus Syntometrine in the active management of the third stage of labour.<doc-sep>To compare the effect of oxytocin and Syntometrine when used as part of active management of third stage of labour on postpartum haemorrhage, hypertension, nausea/vomiting and retained placenta.
                A randomised double blind trial was conducted in the Obstetric Unit of Corniche Hospital, Abu Dhabi in the United Arab Emirates. Between 1 January 1991 and 30 June 1991, 2040 women were randomly allocated either to the oxytocin (n = 1017) or the Syntometrine (n = 1023) group. Twelve patients had to be excluded from the trial (oxytocin, 5; Syntometrine, 7) after randomisation because they no longer fulfilled the inclusion criteria. All women in the trial received either oxytocin 10 units or Syntometrine 1 ml (oxytocin 5 units+ergometrine (ergonovine) 0.5 mg) by intramuscular injection with delivery of the anterior shoulder of the baby. Relative risk with 95% confidence intervals was calculated for each variable.
                Oxytocin (10 units) alone was as effective as Syntometrine (1 ml) in preventing post-partum haemorrhage without an increase in the incidence of retained placenta. Median blood loss was similar in both groups. The incidences of nausea, vomiting and headache were significantly lower in the oxytocin group, as was the occurrence of a mean rise in diastolic and systolic blood pressures of 20 and 30 mmHg or more, respectively.
                Prophylactic administration of oxytocin 10 U in the third stage of labour, as part of active management, reduces the incidence of maternal nausea, vomiting, headache and rise in blood pressure than does Syntometrine 1 ml without adversely affecting the rate of post partum haemorrhage.<doc-sep>Randomised controlled trial of oxytocin alone versus oxytocin and ergometrine in active management of third stage of labour.<doc-sep>To compare intramuscular oxytocin alone and intramuscular oxytocin with ergometrine (Syntometrine) for their effect in reducing the risk of postpartum haemorrhage when both are used as part of the active management of the third stage of labour.

                3497 women were randomly allocated to receive oxytocin-ergometrine (n = 1730) or oxytocin (n = 1753). Rates of postpartum haemorrhage (> or = 500 ml or > or = 1000 ml) were similar in both arms (odds ratio 0.90 (0.82); 95% confidence interval 0.75 to 1.07 (0.59 to 1.14) at 500 ml (1000 ml) threshold). The use of oxytocin-ergometrine was associated with nausea, vomiting, and increased blood pressure.
                There are few advantages but several disadvantages for the routine use of oxytoxinergometrine when prophylactic active management of the third stage of labour is practised.

                Postpartum blood loss, the length of the 3rd stage of labor, and the need for manual removal of the placenta.
                Four hundred sixty-one women were recruited, 230 allocated to ergometrine plus oxytocin and 231 to oxytocin alone. The duration of the 3rd stage of labor in each group was similar (difference in means 0.2 mins; 95% confidence interval [CI], -1.0 to 1.5) and the need for manual removal of the placenta (odds ratio [OR] 1.21; 95% CI, 0.37 to 4.00). There was less postpartum blood loss in the oxytocin plus ergometrine group, reflected in the lower incidence of primary postpartum hemorrhage (> 500 mL) (OR 0.37; 95% CI, 0.16 to 0.85).
                Judged on the basis of this trial alone, oxytocin plus ergometrine is more effective than oxytocin alone in the prevention of postpartum hemorrhage. However, evidence from other trials shows that the ergometrine component not uncommonly has side effects of nausea, vomiting, and raised blood pressure. The implications for practice therefore depend on the relative weights placed on these competing risks by women and clinicians. Further research is needed to quantify these along with research into possible differential effects on longer-term outcomes and into the implications of a higher dose of oxytocin.<doc-sep>A randomised double blind comparison of Syntometrine and Syntocinon in the management of the third stage of labour.<doc-sep>To compare the effect of intramuscular Syntometrine and Syntocinon in the management of the third stage of labour.

                The use of Syntometrine in the management of the third stage not only reduced the blood loss after delivery but was associated with a 40% reduction in the risk of postpartum haemorrhage (odds ratio 0.60; 95% CI 0.21-0.88), and the need for repeat oxytocic injections (odds ratio of 0.63; 95% CI 0.44-0.89). The two drugs did not differ in their effect on the duration of the third stage. However, the incidence of manual removal of the placenta was higher when Syntometrine was used (odds ratio 3.7; 95% CI 1.03-12.5), although the overall incidence remained low. Side effects from both drugs, such as nausea, vomiting, headache and hypertension, were uncommon.

Eleven out of 20 patients completed 24 weeks of therapy with etretinate (up to 0.5 mg/kg/day) whereas only 1/20 patients completed 24 weeks of therapy with ibuprofen alone. Etretinate improved skin lesions, and this may have encouraged patients to persist with it. Improvement of statistical significance was seen for articular index in both groups. In addition significant improvement in ESR, haemoglobin, C-reactive protein, and histidine occurred in the etretinate group. The main side effects of etretinate (which may preclude its use at a higher dose in this condition) included cracked and dried lips and sore mouth.<doc-sep>Therapeutic value of colchicine in the treatment of patients with psoriatic arthritis.<doc-sep>To test the hypothesis that colchicine is an effective treatment of psoriatic arthritis.
                Twenty five patients with psoriatic arthritis were entered into a two centre, double blind, crossover study of 23 weeks' duration comparing the therapeutic effect of colchicine (0.6-1.8 mg/day) with placebo.
                No significant difference was noted between colchicine or placebo treatment for the primary outcome measure (Lansbury joint count) or any of the seven secondary outcome measures. No change in the psoriasis was noted during active or placebo treatment. Adverse clinical effects were reported more often during treatment with colchicine (14 patients) than with the placebo (four patients), resulting in the early withdrawal of three patients receiving colchicine from the trial. Increased creatine kinase values, without weakness, occurred during treatment with colchicine (five patients) and placebo (four patients).
                In conclusion, our study did not provide evidence that colchicine is of therapeutic value in the treatment of psoriatic arthritis.<doc-sep>Sulfasalazine therapy for psoriatic arthritis: a double blind, placebo controlled trial.<doc-sep>Psoriatic arthritis (PsA) is often poorly responsive to 2nd line antirheumatic drug therapy. Sulfasalazine has recently gained wide acceptance in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, and beneficial effects have also been noted in ankylosing spondylitis and reactive arthritis. We report a double blind placebo controlled study of sulfasalazine in PsA.
                Twenty-four patients with active PsA were randomized to receive either sulfasalazine (3 g/day) (n = 10) or placebo (n = 14) for 8 weeks, in a double blind manner, followed by an 8 week open label crossover phase for nonresponding placebo patients.
                Compared with placebo controls, sulfasalazine treated patients were significantly improved at Weeks 4 and 8 with respect to physician (p < 0.01) and patient (p < 0.05) global assessments. Duration of morning stiffness was significantly decreased at Week 8 (p < 0.01). Clinical variables of disease activity returned to baseline after a 4 week drug washout period in 5 evaluable patients. Six patients in the placebo group crossed over to an 8 week open label phase and demonstrated significant improvements in joint scores, 50 ft walking time, and global patient assessment. Sulfasalazine treated patients also showed significant improvements in cutaneous involvement.
                Sulfasalazine was effective in PsA, with efficacy observed as early as the 4th week of treatment.

Methotrexate was given in a dose of 2.5-5.0 mg every 12 hours in 3 consecutive doses per week. A stable background medication program with nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs was allowed. Methotrexate was superior to placebo only in physician assessment of arthritis activity and in improvement of the amount of skin surface area with psoriasis. A small but statistically significant rise of serum total bilirubin occurred in the methotrexate-treated patients.

Auranofin treatment was statistically superior to placebo treatment, according to physician's global assessment and functional scores. A trend in favor of auranofin treatment was seen for each of the other disease parameters studied. Psoriasis worsened in 6 auranofin-treated patients and in 3 placebo-treated patients. The incidence and nature of other side effects were similar to those observed in similar trials of patients with rheumatoid arthritis. Our observations suggest that the use of auranofin in the treatment of psoriatic arthritis is safe, although its therapeutic advantage over treatment with nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs alone is modest.<doc-sep>Fumaric acid therapy for psoriatic arthritis.

                Two hundred twenty-one patients with PsA were recruited from 15 clinics, randomized (double-blind) to SSZ or placebo treatment, and followed up for 36 weeks. Treatment response was based on joint pain/ tenderness and swelling scores and physician and patient global assessments.
                Longitudinal analysis revealed a trend favoring SSZ treatment (P = 0.13). At the end of treatment, response rates were 57.8% for SSZ compared with 44.6% for placebo (P = 0.05). The Westergren erythrocyte sedimentation rate declined more in the PsA patients taking SSZ than in those taking placebo (P < 0.0001). Adverse reactions were fewer than expected and were mainly due to nonspecific gastrointestinal complaints, including dyspepsia, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea.

Greater improvement occurred in those patients on active treatment than on placebo, with more benefit being detected in those patients with the symmetrical polyarticular but seronegative pattern of arthritis associated with a high acute-phase response. SASP was stopped in 26% because of side-effects but these were mild. No exacerbation or remission of psoriasis was observed.

A total of 120 patients were included in nine centres. All patients had active disease and fulfilled the criteria of definite psoriatic arthritis of at least 3 months duration. They received either SSZ (2.0 g/day) or placebo. Efficacy variables included pain, patient's overall assessment of joint and skin improvement, morning stiffness, Ritchie articular index, ESR and CRP. An intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis was performed for the 117 patients who qualified (three patients did not qualify due to missing data after baseline). A per-protocol analysis was performed for the 81 patients who completed the 6 months study period (SSZ = 38, placebo = 43). Major reasons for withdrawal were inadequate response (SSZ = 4, placebo = 7) and adverse events (SSZ = 8, placebo = 12). Pain was the only statistically significantly different primary outcome variable at end point in favour of SSZ in the ITT analysis. No significant differences were present in other clinical or biological variables, although there was a trend in favour of SSZ for some variables. SSZ, at a dose of 2.0 g/day, appeared to be a safe treatment in patients with psoriatic arthritis. At this dosage, its efficacy was only demonstrated for the pain variable.<doc-sep>Sulphasalazine in the management of psoriatic arthritis.<doc-sep>There are few 'second-line' drugs available for the treatment of PSA and their use is often limited by toxicity.

Six patients in the SASP group and 11 on placebo discontinued therapy before 24 wk. Evaluation of effect of treatment revealed significant improvements in articular index in both groups at 12 wk. By 24 wk the articular index in placebo group was still showing benefit. In addition to articular index the SASP group improved significantly in terms of visual analogue scale, duration of morning stiffness and ESR.

14,"Prediction and prevention of delayed ischemic dysfunction after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage and early operation.<doc-sep>Mean hemispheric cerebral blood flow (CBF) was studied after the intravenous administration of xenon-133 in 20 anesthetized patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage. Before early aneurysm operation, repeated CBF measurements were made to evaluate the cerebral vascular reactivity to controlled hyperventilation. Thirteen individuals received intravenous treatment with the calcium channel blocker nimodipine, whereas the other seven patients did not receive such specific antiischemic treatment. Five of the latter patients had an impaired CO2 response, and three showed delayed ischemic deterioration (DID), whereas none of the seven nimodipine-treated patients with impaired CO2 response showed DID. One nimodipine-treated patient with a preserved CO2 response, in whom operation was complicated, developed DID. The observed findings indicate that DID after uncomplicated early aneurysm operation may be associated with an early disturbance of cerebral vasoreactivity. Treatment with nimodipine may counteract the development of DID in patients with an impaired CBF CO2 response.<doc-sep>Magnesium sulfate therapy after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage.<doc-sep>Vasospasm remains a significant source of neurological morbidity and mortality following aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), despite advances in current medical, surgical, and endovascular therapies. Magnesium sulfate therapy has been demonstrated to be both safe and effective in preventing neurological complications in obstetrical patients with eclampsia. Evidence obtained using experimental models of brain injury, cerebral ischemia, and SAH indicate that Mg may also have a role as a neuroprotective agent. The authors hypothesize that MgSO4 therapy is safe, feasible, and has a beneficial effect on vasospasm and, ultimately, on neurological outcome following aneurysmal SAH.
                A prospective randomized single-blind clinical trial of high-dose MgSO4 therapy following aneurysmal SAH (Hunt and Hess Grades II-IV) was performed in 40 patients, who were enrolled within 72 hours following SAH and given intravenous MgSO4 or control solution for 10 days. Serum Mg++ levels were maintained in the 4 to 5.5 mg/dl range throughout the treatment period. Clinical management principles were the same between groups (including early use of surgery or endovascular treatment, followed by aggressive vasospasm prophylaxis and treatment). Daily transcranial Doppler (TCD) ultrasonographic recordings were obtained, and clinical outcomes were measured using the Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS). The patients' GOS scores and the TCD recordings were analyzed using the independent t-test. Forty patients were enrolled in the study: 20 (15 female and five male patients) received treatment and 20 (11 female and nine male patients) comprised a control group. The mean ages of the patients in these groups were 46 and 51, respectively, and the mean clinical Hunt and Hess grades were 2.6 +/- 0.68 in the MgSO4 treatment group and 2.3 +/- 0.73 in the control group (mean +/- standard deviation [SD], p = 0.87). Fisher grades were similar in both groups. Mean middle cerebral artery velocities were 93 +/- 27 cm/second in MgSO4-treated patients and 102 +/- 34 cm/second in the control group (mean +/- SD, p = 0.41). Symptomatic vasospasm, confirmed by angiography, occurred in six of 20 patients receiving MgSO4 and in five of 16 patients receiving placebo. Mean GOS scores were 3.8 +/- 1.6 and 3.6 +/- 1.5 (mean +/- SD, p = 0.74) in the treatment and control groups, respectively. Significant adverse effects from treatment with MgSO4 did not occur.
                Administration of high-dose MgSO4 following aneurysmal SAH is safe, and steady Mg++ levels in the range of 4 to 5.5 mg/dl are easily maintained. This treatment does not interfere with neurological assessment, administration of anesthesia during surgery, or other aspects of clinical care. We observed a trend in which a higher percentage of patients obtained GOS scores of 4 or 5 in the group treated with MgSO4, but the trend did not reach a statistically significant level. A larger study is needed to evaluate this trend further.<doc-sep>Effect of AT877 on cerebral vasospasm after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage. Results of a prospective placebo-controlled double-blind trial.<doc-sep>With the cooperation of 60 neurosurgical centers in Japan, a prospective randomized placebo-controlled double-blind trial of a new calcium antagonist AT877 (hexahydro-1-(5-isoquinolinesulfonyl)-1H-1,4-diazepine hydrochloride, or fasudil hydrochloride) was undertaken to determine the drug's effect on delayed cerebral vasospasm in patients with a ruptured cerebral aneurysm. A total of 276 patients, who underwent surgery within 3 days after subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) of Hunt and Hess Grades I to IV, were entered into the study. Nine patients were excluded because of protocol violation. The remaining 267 patients received either 30 mg AT877 or a placebo (saline) by intravenous injection over 30 minutes, three times a day for 14 days following surgery. Demographic and clinical data were well matched between the two groups. It was found that AT877 reduced angiographically demonstrable vasospasm by 38% (from 61% in the placebo group to 38% in the AT877 group, p = 0.0023), low-density regions on computerized tomography associated with vasospasm by 58% (from 38% to 16%, p = 0.0013), and symptomatic vasospasm by 30% (from 50% to 35%, p = 0.0247). Furthermore, AT877 reduced the number of patients with a poor clinical outcome associated with vasospasm (moderate disability or worse on the Glasgow Outcome Scale at 1 month after SAH) by 54% (from 26% to 12%, p = 0.0152). There were no serious adverse events reported in the AT877 group. This is the first report of a placebo-controlled double-blind trial that has demonstrated a significant reduction in angiographically revealed vasospasm by intravenous drug therapy.<doc-sep>Effect of nimodipine on platelet function in patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage.<doc-sep>We studied platelet function in 41 patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage who were randomized to receive either nimodipine or placebo in a double-blind fashion. Nimodipine was given to 21 patients, intravenously for 7-10 days and then orally until 21 days after the subarachnoid hemorrhage. The other 20 patients received placebo in a similar manner. Nimodipine did not significantly influence platelet aggregability. For the first 1-5 days after the subarachnoid hemorrhage, nimodipine treatment did not have any notable effect on adenosine diphosphate-induced platelet thromboxane B2 release, but a significant (p less than 0.05) inhibitory effect was observed thereafter. During intravenous administration, nimodipine prevented the increase in thromboxane release otherwise observed after subarachnoid hemorrhage. Concomitant with the decrease in thromboxane release, nimodipine increased the platelet count both before and after surgery so that the capacity for thromboxane formation per liter of blood decreased less than expected on the basis of thromboxane release per 10(7) platelets. Our study suggests that nimodipine might diminish the chance of cerebral ischemia by inhibiting platelet thromboxane release.<doc-sep>Controlled study of nimodipine in aneurysm patients treated early after subarachnoid hemorrhage.<doc-sep>We enrolled 75 consecutive patients admitted with subarachnoid hemorrhages in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to determine the effect of early intervention with nimodipine on outcome and cerebral blood flow. The cardioprotective effect of nimodipine was assessed by measuring the electrocardiographic changes over the first 3 days of drug treatment. There was a mild lowering of the mean cerebral blood flow in the nimodipine-treated group over the 21-day period. Analysis of the continuous electrocardiographic traces showed no difference between the nimodipine and placebo groups in the frequency or type of abnormality detected. At 3 months, 4 of the 38 patients receiving nimodipine had died, compared with 10 of the 37 placebo-receiving patients. Of the 50 eligible patients who had a proven cerebral aneurysm, 1 patient (4%) on nimodipine died compared with 6 (24%) receiving placebo (0.01 less than P less than 0.05, chi 2 test; approximate 95% confidence interval for mortality difference, 0.4% to 39.6%). We conclude that nimodipine does not increase the cerebral blood flow or protect the heart after a subarachnoid hemorrhage. There were no side effects from nimodipine. The trend toward improved outcome should be verified in a larger series of patients.<doc-sep>Magnesium sulfate in aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage: a randomized controlled trial.<doc-sep>Magnesium reverses cerebral vasospasm and reduces infarct volume after experimental subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) in rats. We aimed to assess whether magnesium reduces the frequency of delayed cerebral ischemia (DCI) in patients with aneurysmal SAH.
                Patients were randomized within 4 days after SAH. Magnesium sulfate therapy consisted of a continuous intravenous dose of 64 mmol/L per day, to be started within 4 days after SAH and continued until 14 days after occlusion of the aneurysm. The primary outcome DCI (defined as the occurrence of a new hypodense lesion on computed tomography compatible with clinical features of DCI) was analyzed according to the ""on-treatment"" principle. For the secondary outcome measures ""poor outcome"" (Rankin >3) and ""excellent outcome"" (Rankin 0), we used the ""intention-to-treat"" principle.
                A total of 283 patients were randomized. Magnesium treatment reduced the risk of DCI by 34% (hazard ratio, 0.66; 95% CI, 0.38 to 1.14). After 3 months, the risk reduction for poor outcome was 23% (risk ratio, 0.77; 95% CI, 0.54 to 1.09). At that time, 18 patients in the treatment group and 6 in the placebo group had an excellent outcome (risk ratio, 3.4; 95% CI, 1.3 to 8.9).
                This study suggests that magnesium reduces DCI and subsequent poor outcome, but the results are not yet definitive. A next step should be a phase III trial to confirm the beneficial effect of magnesium therapy, with poor outcome as primary outcome.<doc-sep>Prevention of vasospasm in subarachnoid haemorrhage. A controlled study with nimodipine.<doc-sep>A prospective randomized double blind study was conducted in 70 patients suffering from subarachnoid haemorrhage, due to aneurysm rupture, to determine if the use of nimodipine reduces the severity of ischaemic deficits secondary to vasospasm. At the end of the study, two patients had severe deficit or died in the treated group, while 10 had a bad outcome in the placebo group. Angiographic vasospasm was not significantly different in its frequency or its severity between the two groups. However, the association of extensive and diffuse vasospasm was less frequent in the nimodipine group. This study confirms the effectiveness of Nimodipine in reducing the occurrence of neurological deficit due to vasospasm, even if this action is not observed in all cases.<doc-sep>Cerebral arterial spasm--a controlled trial of nimodipine in patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage.<doc-sep>We enrolled 125 neurologically normal patients with intracranial aneurysms in a multi-institution, prospective, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial within 96 hours of their subarachnoid hemorrhage, to determine whether treatment with the calcium blocker nimodipine would prevent or reduce the severity of ischemic neurologic deficits from arterial spasm. A deficit from cerebral arterial spasm that persisted and was severe or caused death by the end of the 21-day treatment period occurred in 8 of 60 patients given placebo and in 1 of 56 given nimodipine (P = 0.03, Fisher's exact test). Analysis of the amount of basal subarachnoid blood on pre-entry CAT scans in patients with deficits from spasm showed that an increase in subarachnoid blood was not associated with a worse neurologic outcome among patients who received nimodipine, unlike the situation in patients given a placebo. There were no side effects from nimodipine. We conclude that nimodipine should be given to patients who are neurologically normal after subarachnoid hemorrhage in order to reduce the occurrence of severe neurologic deficits due to cerebral arterial spasm.<doc-sep>Effect of oral nimodipine on cerebral infarction and outcome after subarachnoid haemorrhage: British aneurysm nimodipine trial.<doc-sep>To determine the efficacy of oral nimodipine in reducing cerebral infarction and poor outcomes (death and severe disability) after subarachnoid haemorrhage.
                Double blind, placebo controlled, randomised trial with three months of follow up and intention to treat analysis. To have an 80% chance with a significance level of 0.05 of detecting a 50% reduction in an incidence of cerebral infarction of 15% a minimum of 540 patients was required.
                Four regional neurosurgical units in the United Kingdom.
                In all 554 patients were recruited between June 1985 and September 1987 out of a population of 1115 patients admitted with subarachnoid haemorrhage proved by the results of lumbar puncture or computed tomography, or both. The main exclusion criterion was admission to the neurosurgical units more than 96 hours after subarachnoid haemorrhage. There were four breaks of code and no exclusions after entry. One patient was withdrawn and in 130 treatment was discontinued early. All patients were followed up for three months and were included in the analysis, except the patient who had been withdrawn.
                Placebo or nimodipine 60 mg was given orally every four hours for 21 days to 276 and 278 patients, respectively. Treatment was started within 96 hours after subarachnoid haemorrhage.
                Incidence of cerebral infarction and ischaemic neurological deficits and outcome three months after entry.
                Demographic and clinical data, including age, sex, history of hypertension and subarachnoid haemorrhage, severity of haemorrhage according to an adaptation of the Glasgow coma scale, number and site of aneurysms on angiography, and initial findings on computed tomography were measured at entry. Deterioration, defined as development of a focal sign or fall of more than one point on the Glasgow coma scale for more than six hours, was investigated by using clinical criteria and by computed tomography, by lumbar puncture, or at necropsy when appropriate. All episodes of deterioration and all patients with a three month outcome other than a good recovery were assessed by a review committee.
                Demographic and clinical data at entry were similar in the two groups. In patients given nimodipine the incidence of cerebral infarction was 22% (61/278) compared with 33% (92/276) in those given placebo, a significant reduction of 34% (95% confidence interval 13 to 50%). Poor outcomes were also significantly reduced by 40% (95% confidence interval 20 to 55%) with nimodipine (20% (55/278) in patients given nimodipine v 33% (91/278) in those given placebo).
                Oral nimodipine 60 mg four hourly is well tolerated and reduces cerebral infarction snd improves outcome after subarachnoid haemorrhage.<doc-sep>",,There is insufficient evidence to support the routine use of calcium antagonists in the treatment of people with aneurysmal SAH.,CD000277
15,"National Cooperative Crohn's Disease Study: results of drug treatment.<doc-sep>The response of active and quiescent Crohn's disease to prednisone, sulfasalazine, or azathioprine has been studied in 569 patients in a placebo-controlled, randomized, multicenter cooperative trial. The response of active symptomatic disease to prednisone or sulfasalazine was significantly better than to placebo. Response to azathioprine was better than to placebo, but the difference did not reach conventional levels of statistical significance. Patients with colonic involvement were especially responsive to sulfasalazine, and those with small bowel involvement were especially responsive to prednisone. Patients' drug therapy immediately before entry to the study significantly affected subsequent response. For patients with quiescent disease, none of the drugs was superior to placebo in prophylaxis against flare-up or recurrence. There is less than a 5% risk that a clinically significant prophylactic effect of any of the drug regimens was missed.<doc-sep>European Cooperative Crohn's Disease Study (ECCDS): results of drug treatment.<doc-sep>A multicenter double-blind study of the effectiveness of sulfasalazine and 6-methylprednisolone, alone and in combination, was conducted on 452 patients with Crohn's disease. One hundred sixty patients were previously untreated; 292 patients were previously treated. The Crohn's disease activity index (CDAI) was used to determine whether a patient had active (CDAI greater than or equal to 150, n = 215) or quiescent disease (CDAI less than 150, n = 237). Treatment of active disease consisted of high-dose 6-methylprednisolone, 6-methylprednisolone combined with 3 g of sulfasalazine, 3 g of sulfasalazine alone, or placebo, and lasted 6 wk. Patients in remission received maintenance doses of one of these drug regimens for periods of up to 2 yr. One hundred ninety-two patients completed the 2-yr study period. Results were evaluated using life-table analysis and outcome ranking. These methods showed 6-methylprednisolone to be the most effective drug in overall comparison of all patients (p less than 0.001); in previously treated patients (p less than 0.001); and in subgroups: active disease (p less than 0.001), only small bowel disease (p less than 0.05), and both small bowel and colon disease (p less than 0.05). Combination of 6-methylprednisolone and sulfasalazine was the most effective regimen in previously untreated patients (p less than 0.05) and when disease was localized in the colon (p less than 0.001). Sulfasalazine alone was least effective in overall comparison of all patients (p less than 0.05) and in all strata. Drug treatment was of no significant benefit to patients with quiescent disease. Continuous administration of low doses of 6-methylprednisolone, or the combination regimen, was beneficial in patients who responded initially to treatment of active disease. The addition of sulfasalazine, however, offered no advantage.<doc-sep>Low dose steroids and clinical relapse in Crohn's disease: a controlled trial.<doc-sep>The long-term effect of prednisone in Crohn's disease has been examined in a double-blind controlled trial. Clinical relapse, recurrence, and extension of the disease were examined in 64 patients followed-up for up to three years. Fourteen patients were withdrawn because of severe symptoms (eight on prednisone and six controls); the withdrawal rate in both groups was 30% at three years. Nine other patients had radiological recurrence or extension of disease (five prednisone and four controls). Prednisone did not improve the relapse rate, nor did it affect recurrence or extension of disease.<doc-sep>",,There is currently no evidence to support the use of low dose steroids in the treatment of Crohn's disease.,CD000301
16,"Case management in a heterogeneous congestive heart failure population: a randomized controlled trial.<doc-sep>Both randomized and nonrandomized controlled studies have linked congestive heart failure (CHF) case management (CM) to decreased readmissions and improved outcomes in mostly homogeneous settings. The objective of this randomized controlled trial was to test the effect of CHF CM on the 90-day readmission rate in a more heterogeneous setting.
                A total of 287 patients admitted to the hospital with the primary or secondary diagnosis of CHF, left ventricular dysfunction of less than 40%, or radiologic evidence of pulmonary edema for which they underwent diuresis were randomized. The intervention consisted of 4 major components: early discharge planning, patient and family CHF education, 12 weeks of telephone follow-up, and promotion of optimal CHF medications.
                The 90-day readmission rates were equal for the CM and usual care groups (37%). Total inpatient and outpatient median costs and readmission median cost were reduced 14% and 26%, respectively, for the intervention group. Patients in the CM group were more likely to be taking CHF medication at target doses, but dosages did not increase significantly throughout 12 weeks. Although both groups took their medications as prescribed equally well, the rest of the adherence to treatment plan was significantly better in the CM group. Subgroup analysis of patients who lived locally and saw a cardiologist showed a significant decrease in CHF readmissions for the intervention group (P =.03).
                These results suggest several limitations to the generalizability of the CHF CM-improved outcome link in a heterogeneous setting. One explanation is that the lack of coordinated system supports and varied accessibility to care in an extended, nonnetworked physician setting limits the effectiveness of the CM.<doc-sep>The effect of a clinical pharmacist discharge service on medication discrepancies in patients with heart failure.<doc-sep>Heart failure patients are regularly admitted to hospital and frequently use multiple medication. Besides intentional changes in pharmacotherapy, unintentional changes may occur during hospitalisation. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of a clinical pharmacist discharge service on medication discrepancies and prescription errors in patients with heart failure.
                A general teaching hospital in Tilburg, the Netherlands.
                An open randomized intervention study was performed comparing an intervention group, with a control group receiving regular care by doctors and nurses. The clinical pharmacist discharge service consisted of review of discharge medication, communicating prescribing errors with the cardiologist, giving patients information, preparation of a written overview of the discharge medication and communication to both the community pharmacist and the general practitioner about this medication. Within 6 weeks after discharge all patients were routinely scheduled to visit the outpatient clinic and medication discrepancies were measured.
                The primary endpoint was the frequency of prescription errors in the discharge medication and medication discrepancies after discharge combined.
                Forty-four patients were included in the control group and 41 in the intervention group. Sixty-eight percent of patients in the control group had at least one discrepancy or prescription error against 39% in the intervention group (RR 0.57 (95% CI 0.37-0.88)). The percentage of medications with a discrepancy or prescription error in the control group was 14.6% and in the intervention group it was 6.1% (RR 0.42 (95% CI 0.27-0.66)).
                This clinical pharmacist discharge service significantly reduces the risk of discrepancies and prescription errors in medication of patients with heart failure in the 1st month after discharge.<doc-sep>Comprehensive discharge planning for the hospitalized elderly. A randomized clinical trial.<doc-sep>To study the effects of a comprehensive discharge planning protocol, designed specifically for the elderly and implemented by nurse specialists, on patient and caregiver outcomes and cost of care.
                Randomized clinical trial.
                Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania.
                276 patients and 125 caregivers. Patients were 70 years and older and were placed in selected medical and surgical cardiac diagnostic-related groups.
                Group differences in patient outcomes (length of initial hospital stay, length of time between initial hospital discharge and readmission, and rehospitalization rates) and charges for care (charges for initial hospitalization, rehospitalizations, health services after discharge, and nurse specialist services) were measured 2, 6, and 12 weeks after discharge.
                From the initial hospital discharge to 6 weeks after discharge, patients in the medical intervention group had fewer readmissions, fewer total days rehospitalized, lower readmission charges, and lower charges for health care services after discharge. No differences in these outcomes were found between the surgical intervention and control groups during this period.
                Study findings support the need for comprehensive discharge planning designed for the elderly and implemented by nurse specialists to improve their outcomes after hospital discharge and to achieve cost savings. The findings also suggest that this intervention had its greatest effect in delaying or preventing rehospitalization of patients in the medical intervention group during the first 6 weeks after discharge.<doc-sep>A new multimodal geriatric discharge-planning intervention to prevent emergency visits and rehospitalizations of older adults: the optimization of medication in AGEd multicenter randomized controlled trial.<doc-sep>To determine whether a new multimodal comprehensive discharge-planning intervention would reduce emergency rehospitalizations or emergency department (ED) visits for very old inpatients.
                Six-month prospective, randomized (Zelen design), parallel-group, open-label trial.
                Six acute geriatric units (AGUs) in Paris and its surroundings.
                Six hundred sixty-five consecutive inpatients aged 70 and older (intervention group (IG) n = 317; control group (CG) n = 348).
                Intervention-dedicated geriatricians different from those in the study centers implemented the intervention, which targeted three risk factors for preventable readmissions and consisted of three components: comprehensive chronic medication review, education on self-management of disease, and detailed transition-of-care communication with outpatient health professionals.
                Emergency hospitalization or ED visit 3 and 6 months after discharge, as assessed by telephone calls to the participant, the caregiver, and the general practitioner and confirmed with the hospital administrative database.
                Twenty-three percent of IG participants were readmitted to hospital or had an ED visit 3 months after discharge, compared with 30.5% of CG participants (P = .03); at 6 months, the proportions were 35.3% and 40.8%, respectively (P = .15). Event-free survival was significantly higher in the IG at 3 months (hazard ratio (HR) = 0.72, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.53-0.97, P = .03) but not at 6 months (HR = 0.81, 95% CI = 0.64-1.04, P = .10).
                This intervention was effective in reducing rehospitalizations and ED visits for very elderly participants 3 but not 6 months after their discharge from the AGU. Future research should investigate the effect of this intervention of transitional care in a larger population and in usual acute and subacute geriatric care.

                randomized controlled trial.
                we randomized patients aged 75 years and older on four or more medicines who had been discharged from three acute general and one long-stay hospital to a pharmacy intervention or usual care.
                the hospital pharmacist developed discharge plans which gave details of medication and support required by the patient. A copy was given to the patient and to all relevant professionals and carers. This was followed by a domiciliary assessment by a community pharmacist. In the control group, patients were discharged from hospital following standard procedures that included a discharge letter to the general practitioner listing current medications.
                the primary outcome was re-admission to hospital within 6 months. Secondary outcomes included the number of deaths, attendance at hospital outpatient clinics and general practice and proportion of days in hospital over the follow-up period, together with patients' general well-being, satisfaction with the service and knowledge of and adherence to prescribed medication.
                we recruited 362 patients, of whom 181 were randomized to each group. We collected hospital and general practice data on at least 91 and 72% of patients respectively at each follow-up point and interviewed between 43 and 90% of the study subjects. There were no significant differences between the groups in the proportion of patients re-admitted to hospital between baseline and 3 months or 3 and 6 months. There were no significant differences in any of the secondary outcomes.
                we found no evidence to suggest that the co-ordinated hospital and community pharmacy care discharge plans in elderly patients in this study influence outcomes.<doc-sep>To evaluate the effectiveness of a discharge-planning programme for hip fracture patients.<doc-sep>This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of a comprehensive discharge-planning service for hip fracture patients, including length of stay, functional status, self-care knowledge and quality of life (QOL).
                Hip fractures are the most devastating result of osteoporosis. Care of these patients from the moment they enter the hospital until discharge and postdischarge is a challenging task, requiring a coordinated approach by an interdisciplinary team.
                An experimental design was used. Methods. Fifty hip fracture patients were recruited from a medical centre in Taipei, Taiwan and randomly divided into two groups. The control group received routine discharge nursing care and the experimental group received comprehensive discharge planning. After patient admission, researchers assessed discharge-planning needs, provided discharge nursing instruction, coordinated services and determined discharge placement based on assessment results.
                (i) Mean age of 50 hip fracture patients was 78.75 (SD 6.99) years. Mean length of stay was 6.04 (SD 2.41) days for the experimental group and 6.29 (SD 2.17) for the control group. Difference between groups was not significant (t = -0.394, p = 0.696). (ii) The self-care knowledge of the experimental group was higher than that of the control group (F = 11.569, p = 0.001). (iii) Significant improvements were observed in functional status of both groups at three months postdischarge, with no significant differences observed between groups. However, the functional status of experimental group patients showed a slightly better trend than that of the control group. (iv) At three months postdischarge, QOL of experimental group patients was better than control group patients.
                A comprehensive discharge-planning service can improve hip fracture patients' self-care knowledge and QOL. Relevance TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: Results of this study can be used clinically as a basis for practical implementation of discharge-planning services in fracture patients.<doc-sep>Benefits of home visits for falls and autonomy in the elderly: a randomized trial study.<doc-sep>To investigate whether home visits by a occupational therapist reduces the risk of falling and improves the autonomy of older patients hospitalized for falling.
                In this randomized, controlled trial set in a geriatric hospital, 60 patients (mean age, 83.5 yr) who were hospitalized for falling were recruited from the acute medicine department. A home visit from an occupational therapist and an ergotherapist assessed patients' homes for environmental hazards and recommended modifications. The outcomes measured were falls, autonomy, hospitalization for falling, institutionalization, and death.
                During the follow-up period, the rate of falls, hospitalization for falls, institutionalization, and death were not significantly different between the two groups. Both groups had a loss of dependence at 12 mo. This loss of dependence was significant in the control group but not in the intervention group.
                Home visits from occupational therapists during hospitalization of older patients at risk for falling can help to preserve the patient's autonomy.<doc-sep>Effects of a multidisciplinary, post-discharge continuance of care intervention on quality of life, discharge satisfaction, and hospital length of stay: a randomized controlled trial.<doc-sep>To determine the impact of a hospital-coordinated discharge care plan, involving a multidisciplinary team of primary health care providers, on hospital length of stay, quality of life, and both patient and general practitioner inclusion in, and satisfaction with, discharge procedures.
                This investigation comprised a prospective, randomized, controlled, clinical trial.
                This multicentre and cross-jurisdictional study focused on areas of tertiary and primary health care as well as community allied health in Western Australia.
                Patients (n = 189) with chronic cardiorespiratory diagnoses were recruited from respiratory, cardiovascular, and general medical wards at two tertiary hospitals.
                Subjects were randomly assigned to one of two groups. Intervention group patients received a discharge care plan in accordance with that outlined in the Australian Enhanced Primary Care Package, completed before discharge and sent to the patient's general practitioner and other community service providers for review. Control patients were discharged under existing hospital processes. Outcome measures. Patients and general practitioners were surveyed pre-discharge and 7 days post-discharge for quality of life and opinion of discharge procedures. Hospital length of stay was also determined.
                Significant improvements in discharge planning involvement, health service access, confidence with discharge procedures, and opinion of discharge based on previous experience were seen for patients who received the discharge care plan. Further, improved perceptions of mental quality of life were observed within the first week post-discharge for intervention patients. Length of stay showed no difference between groups. Extent and speed of hospital-general practitioner communication were significantly improved via the intervention.
                Our results indicate that a multidisciplinary discharge care plan, initiated before separation, improves quality of life, involvement, and satisfaction with discharge care, and hospital-general practitioner integration. As such, it possesses benefits over current Western Australian hospital discharge procedures for the care of chronically ill populations.<doc-sep>A reengineered hospital discharge program to decrease rehospitalization: a randomized trial.<doc-sep>Emergency department visits and rehospitalization are common after hospital discharge.

                A nurse discharge advocate worked with patients during their hospital stay to arrange follow-up appointments, confirm medication reconciliation, and conduct patient education with an individualized instruction booklet that was sent to their primary care provider. A clinical pharmacist called patients 2 to 4 days after discharge to reinforce the discharge plan and review medications. Participants and providers were not blinded to treatment assignment.
                Primary outcomes were emergency department visits and hospitalizations within 30 days of discharge. Secondary outcomes were self-reported preparedness for discharge and frequency of primary care providers' follow-up within 30 days of discharge. Research staff doing follow-up were blinded to study group assignment.
                Participants in the intervention group (n = 370) had a lower rate of hospital utilization than those receiving usual care (n = 368) (0.314 vs. 0.451 visit per person per month; incidence rate ratio, 0.695 [95% CI, 0.515 to 0.937]; P = 0.009). The intervention was most effective among participants with hospital utilization in the 6 months before index admission (P = 0.014). Adverse events were not assessed; these data were collected but are still being analyzed.
                This was a single-center study in which not all potentially eligible patients could be enrolled, and outcome assessment sometimes relied on participant report.

The coordinated contributions of home care personnel].<doc-sep>In cooperation between the home care system in the Municipality of Rødovre and four hospital departments in the County of Copenhagen, a controlled and randomized investigation was undertaken among the hospitalized patients of 65 years and over from the Municipality of Rødovre. A nurse employed by the Municipality particularly for this project visited the hospital daily and followed the 135 participants in the intervention group with the objects of obtaining information from the primary sector if necessary, discussing discharge with the patient and the hospital staff, coordinating possible supportive measures in the patient's home and visiting the patient in his home immediately after discharge from hospital in order to ensure continuity in care and treatment. The 138 participants in the control group underwent the usual procedures in connection with admission to hospital. In this article, the consequences of the contributions by the health visitor in the hospital are described in relation to the course of hospitalization. The intervention group had an average stay in hospital of 11.0 days as compared with 14.3 days in the control group (p greater than 0.05), and the total number of bed-days were 1,490 and 1,970, respectively. In addition, the two groups were compared as regards the number of diagnostic procedures during hospitalization, the number of deaths, the diagnoses on discharge and the functional capacity. No differences were observed in these respects between the two groups. Three patients from the control group were discharged to residential institutions as compared with none in the intervention group.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)<doc-sep>Quality of life of individuals with heart failure: a randomized trial of the effectiveness of two models of hospital-to-home transition.<doc-sep>The growing number of patients with congestive heart failure has increased both the pressure on hospital resources and the need for community management of the condition. Improving hospital-to-home transition for this population is a logical step in responding to current practice guidelines' recommendations for coordination and education. Positive outcomes have been reported from trials evaluating multiple interventions, enhanced hospital discharge, and follow-up through the addition of a case management role. The question remains if similar gains could be achieved working with usual hospital and community nurses.
                A 12-week, prospective, randomized controlled trial was conducted of the effect of transitional care on health-related quality of life (disease-specific and generic measures), rates of readmission, and emergency room use. The nurse-led intervention focused on the transition from hospital-to-home and supportive care for self-management 2 weeks after hospital discharge.
                At 6 weeks after hospital discharge, the overall Minnesota Living with Heart Failure Questionnaire (MLHFQ) score was better among the Transitional Care patients (27.2 +/- 19.1 SD) than among the Usual Care patients (37.5 +/- 20.3 SD; P = 0.002). Similar results were found at 12 weeks postdischarge for the overall MLHFQ and at 6- and 12-weeks postdischarge for the MLHFQ's Physical Dimension and Emotional Dimension subscales. Differences in generic quality life, as assessed by the SF-36 Physical component, Mental Component, and General Health subscales, were not significantly different between the Transition and Usual Care groups. At 12 weeks postdischarge, 31% of the Usual Care patients had been readmitted compared with 23% of the Transitional Care patients (P = 0.26), and 46% of the Usual Care group visited the emergency department compared with 29% in the Transitional Care group (chi2 = 4.86, df 1, P = 0.03).
                There were significant improvements in health-related quality of life (HRQL) associated with Transitional Care and less use of emergency rooms.<doc-sep>Evaluation of a hospital-based community liaison pharmacy service in Northern Ireland.<doc-sep>To evaluate the impact of a hospital based community liaison pharmacy service on a range of outcomes in patients aged more than 55 years and taking more than 3 prescribed drugs, who had been admitted to the medical unit of a district general hospital in Northern Ireland.
                Having recruited 243 patients, a total of 162 patients completed the full protocol (81 randomly assigned to intervention and 81 to control; mean age of control patients 75 years; mean age of intervention patients 73 years). The interventions by the community liaison pharmacist included: preparation of an accurate medication record following a full review of current medication use; medication counselling; provision of a medicines record sheet informing the patient how to take their drugs; provision of a pharmaceutical discharge letter detailing changes made to drug therapy (this was faxed to the patient's GP and community pharmacist on the day of discharge); provision of a Medicines Helpline.
                The key findings were as follows: problems were identified in 80% of the intervention patients' prescription charts, 49% of which related to drug omissions from the patients' domiciliary prescriptions. The GP practice record was the most accurate (mean error rate 12.6%) while the GP referral letter was the least accurate (mean error rate 47.3%) source of medication information. Drugs patients brought to hospital were also an inaccurate source (mean error rate 44.0%). The intervention group patients, when compared with control patients, had a significant reduction (P = 0.005) in drug mismatch between drugs prescribed at discharge and taken at home, and had a greater knowledge of their drug regimen 10-14 days after discharge (P < 0.001). The vast majority of patients (96%) felt that the provision of a medicine helpline was a useful service.
                The study indicated clear benefits from the involvement of a hospital based community liaison pharmacist in achieving seamless pharmaceutical care between the primary and secondary healthcare settings.<doc-sep>A multidisciplinary intervention to prevent the readmission of elderly patients with congestive heart failure.<doc-sep>Congestive heart failure is the most common indication for admission to the hospital among older adults. Behavioral factors, such as poor compliance with treatment, frequently contribute to exacerbations of heart failure, a fact suggesting that many admissions could be prevented.
                We conducted a prospective, randomized trial of the effect of a nurse-directed, multidisciplinary intervention on rates of readmission within 90 days of hospital discharge, quality of life, and costs of care for high-risk patients 70 years of age or older who were hospitalized with congestive heart failure. The intervention consisted of comprehensive education of the patient and family, a prescribed diet, social-service consultation and planning for an early discharge, a review of medications, and intensive follow-up.
                Survival for 90 days without readmission, the primary outcome measure, was achieved in 91 of the 142 patients in the treatment group, as compared with 75 of the 140 patients in the control group, who received conventional care (P = 0.09). There were 94 readmissions in the control group and 53 in the treatment group (risk ratio, 0.56; P = 0.02). The number of readmissions for heart failure was reduced by 56.2 percent in the treatment group (54 vs. 24, P = 0.04), whereas the number of readmissions for other causes was reduced by 28.5 percent (40 vs. 29, P not significant). In the control group, 23 patients (16.4 percent) had more than one readmission, as compared with 9 patients (6.3 percent) in the treatment group (risk ratio, 0.39; P = 0.01). In a subgroup of 126 patients, quality-of-life scores at 90 days improved more from base line for patients in the treatment group (P = 0.001). Because of the reduction in hospital admissions, the overall cost of care was $460 less per patient in the treatment group.
                A nurse-directed, multidisciplinary intervention can improve quality of life and reduce hospital use and medical costs for elderly patients with congestive heart failure.<doc-sep>Does increased access to primary care reduce hospital readmissions? Veterans Affairs Cooperative Study Group on Primary Care and Hospital Readmission.<doc-sep>For chronically ill patients, readmission to the hospital can be frequent and costly. We studied the effect of an intervention designed to increase access to primary care after discharge from the hospital, with the goals of reducing readmissions and emergency department visits and increasing patients' quality of life and satisfaction with care.
                In a multicenter randomized, controlled trial at nine Veterans Affairs Medical Centers, we randomly assigned 1396 veterans hospitalized with diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or congestive heart failure to receive either usual care or an intensive primary care intervention. The intervention involved close follow-up by a nurse and a primary care physician, beginning before discharge and continuing for the next six months.
                The patients were severely ill. Half of those with congestive heart failure (504 patients) had disease in New York Heart Association class III or IV; 30 percent of those with diabetes (751 patients) had end-organ damage; and a quarter of those with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (583 patients) required home oxygen treatment or oral corticosteroids. The patients had extremely poor quality-of-life scores. Although they received more intensive primary care than the controls, the patients in the intervention group had significantly higher rates of readmission (0.19 vs 0.14 per month, P = 0.005) and more days of rehospitalization (10.2 vs 8.8, P = 0.041). The patients in the intervention group were more satisfied with their care (P < 0.001), but there was no difference between the study groups in quality-of-life scores, which remained very low (P = 0.53).
                For veterans discharged from Veterans Affairs hospitals, the primary care intervention we studied increased rather than decreased the rate of rehospitalization, although patients in the intervention group were more satisfied with their care.<doc-sep>Prevention of readmission in elderly patients with congestive heart failure: results of a prospective, randomized pilot study.<doc-sep>To determine the feasibility and potential impact of a non-pharmacologic multidisciplinary intervention for reducing hospital readmissions in elderly patients with congestive heart failure.

                550-bed secondary and tertiary care university teaching hospital.
                98 patients > or = 70 years of age (mean 79 +/- 6 years) admitted with documented congestive heart failure.
                Comprehensive multidisciplinary treatment strategy consisting of intensive teaching by a geriatric cardiac nurse, a detailed review of medications by a geriatric cardiologist with specific recommendations designed to improve medication compliance and reduce side effects, early consultation with social services to facilitate discharge planning, dietary teaching by a hospital dietician, and close follow-up after discharge by home care and the study team.
                All patients were followed for 90 days after initial hospital discharge. The primary study endpoints were rehospitalization within the 90-day interval and the cumulative number of days hospitalized during follow-up. The 90-day readmission rate was 33.3% (21.7%-44.9%) for the patients receiving the study intervention (n = 63) compared with 45.7% (29.2%-62.2%) for the control patients (n = 35). The mean number of days hospitalized was 4.3 +/- 1.1 (2.1-6.5) for the treated patients vs 5.7 +/- 2.0 (1.8-9.6) for the usual-care patients. In a prospectively defined subgroup of patients at intermediate risk for readmission (n = 61), readmissions were reduced by 42.2% (from 47.6% to 27.5%; p = 0.10), and the average number of hospital days during follow-up decreased from 6.7 +/- 3.2 days to 3.2 +/- 1.2 days (p = NS).
                These pilot data suggest that a comprehensive, multidisciplinary approach to reducing repetitive hospitalizations in elderly patients with congestive heart failure may lead to a reduction in readmissions and hospital days, particularly in patients at moderate risk for early rehospitalization. Further evaluation of this treatment strategy, including an assessment of the cost-effectiveness, is warranted.<doc-sep>Effects of a medical team coordinator on length of hospital stay.<doc-sep>To determine the effect of a medical team coordinator (MTC) on the length of stay in a teaching hospital.
                Randomized controlled trial.
                Two of four general medical clinical teaching units (CTUs).
                Patients admitted to the CTUs between July and October 1990 except those who were admitted directly to an intensive care unit or whose death was expected within 48 hours. The 267 patients were randomly assigned to receive either standard medical care or standard medical care plus MTC services.
                The MTC was a baccalaureate nurse whose role was to facilitate administrative tasks such as discharge planning, to coordinate tests and procedures, and to collect and collate patient information.
                Length of hospital stay. A subgroup of 40 patients was asked to complete a brief survey on medical care information and satisfaction.
                The MTC intervention reduced the mean length of stay by 1.97 days (p less than or equal to 0.04, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.02 to 2.92 days). Subanalysis by diagnostic group revealed that most of this effect was in an ill-defined group of disorders. In the survey more patients in the MTC group than in the other group reported being satisfied with their medical care (89% v. 62%; p less than or equal to 0.05, 95% CI 2% to 52%).
                The services of an MTC help to reduce the length of hospital stay for some groups of patients. Further research is necessary to examine which components of the MTC intervention are most effective and in what conditions.<doc-sep>Evaluating hospital discharge planning: a randomized clinical trial.<doc-sep>To select patients for early discharge planning, a randomized clinical trial evaluated a protocol that used risk factors identified upon hospital admission. The goal of the study was to determine if intervention with high-risk patients could reduce the need for hospital admission or skilled care. Of 13,255 patients screened, 835 study participants were identified as ""at risk"" for frequent health care resource use. Half of the high-risk patients were randomly assigned to the experimental group (n = 417) and received discharge planning from day 3 of their hospital stay, while the control group (n = 418) received discharge planning only if there was a written physician request. Those patients receiving early, systematic discharge planning experienced an increased likelihood of successful return to home after hospital admission and a decreased chance of unscheduled readmission for the 9-month study period. Length of the index hospital stay was not affected by early planning, however. The major clinical implication is the potential for discharge planners to decrease the need for, and use of, health care resources after hospital admission.<doc-sep>Reducing hospital costs for the geriatric patient admitted from the emergency department: a randomized trial.<doc-sep>To test the impact of a geriatric evaluation and management model on the costs of acute hospital management of emergently admitted older adults.

                Adults 70 years of age and older admitted from the Emergency Department to the medicine service (non-ICU admission) who did not have an internist on staff at the admitting hospital. Of 141 randomized patients, 111 (78.7%) met eligibility criteria.
                Assignment of a geriatrician and a social worker as the primary managing team during the hospital stay.
                Length of stay, total cost of acute hospital care, cost of laboratory, pharmacy, and rehabilitation services.
                Patients in the intervention group had 2.1 fewer days of hospitalization, but this shorter length of stay was not statistically significant (P = 0.108). There were no differences in mortality or discharge disposition. In risk-adjusted, multiple regression analysis the intervention group had a statistically significant lower predicted total cost per patient than the usual care group (-$2,544, P = 0.029); assignment to the intervention group was associated with a lower predicted cost per patient for laboratory (including cardiology graphics) services (P = 0.007) and pharmacy costs (P = 0.047).
                When controlled for important predictors of expected resource use, care provided by a geriatric management team resulted in a significant reduction in the cost of hospitalization. A reduction in the cost of laboratory, cardiographic, and pharmacy services is consistent with the team's philosophy of defining the services needed based on goals related to functional outcomes.<doc-sep>Randomized controlled trial of integrated (managed) care pathway for stroke rehabilitation.<doc-sep>Integrated Care Pathway (ICP) is an organized, goal-defined, and time-managed plan that has the potential of facilitating timely interdisciplinary coordination, improving discharge planning, and reducing length of hospital stay.
                An ICP for stroke rehabilitation based on evidence of best practice, professional standards, and existing infrastructure was developed. Its effectiveness was tested in 152 stroke patients undergoing rehabilitation who were randomized to receive ICP care coordinated by an experienced nurse (n=76) or conventional multidisciplinary care (n=76).
                The age, sex, premorbid functional ability, and stroke characteristics of the 2 groups were comparable. There were no differences in mortality rates (10 [13%] versus 6 [8%]), institutionalization (10 [13%] versus 16 [21%]), or length of hospital stay (50+/-19 versus 45+/-23 days) between patients receiving ICP or multidisciplinary care. Patients receiving conventional multidisciplinary care improved significantly faster between 4 and 12 weeks (median change in Barthel Activities of Daily Living Index 6 versus 2; P<0.01) and had higher Quality of Life scores at 12 weeks (65 versus 59; P=0.07) and 6 months (72 versus 63; P<0.005). There were no significant differences in the mean duration of physiotherapy (42.8+/-41.2 versus 39.4+/-36.4 hours) or occupational therapy (8.5+/-7.5 versus 8.0+/-7.5 hours) received between the 2 groups.
                ICP management offered no benefit over conventional multidisciplinary care on a stroke rehabilitation unit. Functional recovery was faster and Quality of Life outcomes better in patients receiving conventional multidisciplinary care.<doc-sep>The feasibility and efficacy of early discharge planning initiated by the admitting department in two acute care hospitals.<doc-sep>To determine the feasibility and efficacy of early discharge planning, initiated by admitting department personnel, a randomized, controlled trial was undertaken in 2 acute care, university-affiliated hospitals. The intervention tested was referral of patients by admitting personnel to nursing, social work, physiotherapy, occupational therapy, or dietary services for potential discharge planning. A 1-page, 65-item questionnaire was designed to identify patients for referral to the various allied health services. A copy of this was sent to the appropriate service, according to predefined criteria. The questionnaire took an average of 4 min to complete. The criteria used were highly predictive of length of stay, the most important being age, followed by living outside St. John's, admission within the previous 3 months, emergency admission, and being in need of community services. In Hospital A, the cases (n = 421) referred for early discharge planning had significantly shorter length of stay (Mantel-Cox, p = 0.03) than controls (n = 420), who were identical for all factors predictive of prolonged length of stay. The reduction in length of stay amounted to a mean of 0.8 d. In Hospital B (n = 758), the intervention was less effective because of a lower proportion of patients with factors associated with prolonged hospital stay and, perhaps, because of inadequate implementation of the program. We conclude that identification, by admitting department personnel, of patients who may benefit from early discharge planning is feasible. This process will reduce length of hospital stay, but its effectiveness is dependent on case mix variables and enthusiastic implementation of the program.<doc-sep>Redefining and redesigning hospital discharge to enhance patient care: a randomized controlled study.<doc-sep>Patients are routinely ill-prepared for the transition from hospital to home.

                A culturally and linguistically diverse group of patients admitted to a small community teaching hospital.
                Four undesirable outcomes were measured after hospital discharge: (1) no outpatient follow-up within 21 days; (2) readmission within 31 days; (3) emergency department visit within 31 days; and (4) failure by the primary care provider to complete an outpatient workup recommended by the hospital doctors. Outcomes of the intervention group were compared to concurrent and historical controls.
                Only 25.5% of intervention patients had 1 or more undesirable outcomes compared to 55.1% of the concurrent and 55.0% of the historical controls. Notably, only 14.9% of the intervention patients failed to follow-up within 21 days compared to 40.8% of the concurrent and 35.0% of the historical controls. Only 11.5% of recommended outpatient workups in the intervention group were incomplete versus 31.3% in the concurrent and 31.0% in the historical controls.

17,"Early randomized intervention with high-frequency jet ventilation in respiratory distress syndrome.<doc-sep>To determine whether early use of high-frequency jet ventilation reduces neonatal mortality or pulmonary morbidity rates, we randomly selected 42 infants with clinical and radiographic evidence of severe respiratory distress syndrome to receive either high-frequency jet ventilation or conventional ventilation. Separate sequential analyses (two-sided, alpha = 0.05, power = 0.95 to detect 85:15 advantage) were performed for mortality rates, air leaks, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, intraventricular hemorrhage, and assignment crossover, and a combined analysis was performed, with death overriding other outcome variables. Enrollment was completed when the combined analysis reached the sequential design boundary indicating no treatment difference. Mortality rates (19% among infants receiving high-frequency jet ventilation vs 24% among infants receiving conventional ventilation), the incidence of air leaks (48% vs 52%), bronchopulmonary dysplasia (39% vs 41%), and intraventricular hemorrhage (33% vs 43%), and assignment crossovers (14% vs 24%) did not differs significantly between the treatment groups. We conclude that early use of high-frequency jet ventilation does not prevent or substantially reduce mortality or morbidity rates associated with assisted ventilation.<doc-sep>Multicenter controlled clinical trial of high-frequency jet ventilation in preterm infants with uncomplicated respiratory distress syndrome.<doc-sep>To test the hypothesis that high-frequency jet ventilation (HFJV) will reduce the incidence and/or severity of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) and acute airleak in premature infants who, despite surfactant administration, require mechanical ventilation for respiratory distress syndrome.
                Multicenter, randomized, controlled clinical trial of HFJV and conventional ventilation (CV). Patients were to remain on assigned therapy for 14 days or until extubation, whichever came first. Crossover from CV to HFJV was allowed if bilateral pulmonary interstitial emphysema or bronchopleural fistula developed. Patients could cross over to the other ventilatory mode if failure criteria were met. The optimal lung volume strategy was mandated for HFJV by protocol to provide alveolar recruitment and optimize lung volume and ventilation/perfusion matching, while minimizing pressure amplitude and O2 requirements. CV management was not controlled by protocol.
                Eight tertiary neonatal intensive care units.
                Preterm infants with birth weights between 700 and 1500 g and gestational age <36 weeks who required mechanical ventilation with FIO2 >0.30 at 2 to 12 hours after surfactant administration, received surfactant by 8 hours of age, were <20 hours old, and had been ventilated for <12 hours. Outcome Measures. Primary outcome variables were BPD at 28 days and 36 weeks of postconceptional age. Secondary outcome variables were survival, gas exchange, airway pressures, airleak, intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH), periventricular leukomalacia (PVL), and other nonpulmonary complications.
                A total of 130 patients were included in the final analysis; 65 were randomized to HFJV and 65 to CV. The groups were of comparable birth weight, gestational age, severity of illness, postnatal age, and other demographics. The incidence of BPD at 36 weeks of postconceptional age was significantly lower in babies randomized to HFJV compared with CV (20.0% vs 40.4%). The need for home oxygen was also significantly lower in infants receiving HFJV compared with CV (5.5% vs 23.1%). Survival, incidence of BPD at 28 days, retinopathy of prematurity, airleak, pulmonary hemorrhage, grade I-II IVH, and other complications were similar. In retrospect, it was noted that the traditional HFJV strategy emphasizing low airway pressures (HF-LO) rather than the prescribed optimal volume strategy (HF-OPT) was used in 29/65 HFJV infants. This presented a unique opportunity to examine the effects of different HFJV strategies on gas exchange, airway pressures, and outcomes. HF-OPT was defined as increase in positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) by >/=1 cm H2O from pre-HFJV baseline and/or use of PEEP of >/=7 cm H2O. Severe neuroimaging abnormalities (PVL and/or grade III-IV IVH) were not different between the CV and HFJV infants. However, there was a significantly lower incidence of severe IVH/PVL in HFJV infants treated with HF-OPT compared with CV and HF-LO. Oxygenation was similar between CV and HFJV groups as a whole, but HF-OPT infants had better oxygenation compared with the other two groups. There were no differences in PaCO2 between CV and HFJV, but the PaCO2 was lower for HF-LO compared with the other two groups. The peak inspiratory pressure and DeltaP (peak inspiratory pressure-PEEP) were lower for HFJV infants compared with CV infants.
                HFJV reduces the incidence of BPD at 36 weeks and the need for home oxygen in premature infants with uncomplicated RDS, but does not reduce the risk of acute airleak. There is no increase in adverse outcomes compared with CV. HF-OPT improves oxygenation, decreases exposure to hypocarbia, and reduces the risk of grade III-IV IVH and/or PVL.<doc-sep>High-frequency jet ventilation in the early management of respiratory distress syndrome is associated with a greater risk for adverse outcomes.<doc-sep>The objective of this investigation was to determine if high-frequency jet ventilation (HFJV) used early in the treatment of premature infants with respiratory distress syndrome was effective in reducing pulmonary morbidity without increasing the occurrence of adverse neurologic outcomes.
                A total of 73 premature infants who met the inclusion criteria (gestational age of less than 33 weeks, birth weight of more than 500 g, age of less than 24 hours, need for assisted ventilation with peak inspiratory pressure of more than 16 and FIO2 more than 0.30, and roentgenographic evidence of respiratory distress syndrome) were randomized to either conventional (n = 36) or to high-frequency jet (n = 37) ventilation. Our goals were to maintain the infants on the assigned ventilator for at least 7 days unless they could either be extubated or meet crossover criteria. Univariate analyses were initially used to compare the two groups. Stepwise logistic regression was subsequently used to assess whether various factors independently influenced adverse outcomes.
                The two groups of infants were similar in all obstetrical, perinatal, and neonatal demographic characteristics. The mean birth weight and gestational age in the conventional group were 930 g and 26.6 weeks and in the HFJV group, 961 g and 26.9 weeks. The infants were randomized at similar ages (7.1 and 7.3 hours of life, respectively). Their prerandomization ventilator settings and arterial blood gases were nearly identical. There were no differences in pulmonary outcomes (occurrence of air leaks, need for oxygen or ventilation at 36 weeks postconception), and there were no differences in the mean number of days oxygen was required, number of days ventilated, or length of hospital stay. Infants ventilated with HFJV were significantly more likely to develop cystic periventricular leukomalacia (10 vs 2, P = .022) or to have a poor outcome (grade IV hemorrhage, cystic periventricular leukomalacia, or death) (17 vs 7, P = .016). Logistic regression analysis revealed HFJV to be a significant independent predictor of both cystic periventricular leukomalacia and a poor outcome. The presence of hypocarbia was not an independently significant predictor of adverse outcomes.
                With the HFJV treatment strategy that we used, use of the high-frequency jet ventilator in the early management of premature infants with respiratory distress syndrome resulted in significantly more adverse outcomes than in those treated with conventional mechanical ventilation.<doc-sep>",,There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of HFJV in preterm infants with uncomplicated RDS.,CD000328
18,"Availability of iron and degree of inflammation modifies the response to recombinant human erythropoietin when treating anemia of chronic disease in patients with rheumatoid arthritis.<doc-sep>Forty-six patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and documented anemia of chronic disease (Hb < 100/110 g/l) were randomized to receive either human recombinant erythropoietin (r-HuEPO, n = 36, 300 U/kg body weight) or placebo (n = 10) for 12 weeks in a multicenter study. An adequate response was defined as elevation of Hb > or = 120 g/l. Relevant clinical and laboratory assessments were made to evaluate efficacy and secure safety. A significant elevation in Hb from week 10 onwards was noted in twenty-six patients (five drop-outs) out of nine patients receiving placebo (one drop-out) (12 +/- 1.2 g/l vs 4 +/- 0.5 g/l; Hb elevation from 95 g/l to 107 g/l vs 93 g/l to 97 g/l, P < 0.05). Only 14.6%, however, were considered responders according to preset criteria. In the responders a lower initial CRP, a significant reduction in ESR but not in CRP was seen compared to the remaining r-HuEPO group. A significant elevation of energy level was noted in the r-HuEPO group; otherwise, no differences in clinical variables were seen. No serious adverse effects were noted. When analyzing patients receiving oral iron in combination with r-HuEPO and adding five additional, openly selected patients receiving both adequate iron supplementation and r-HuEPO, there was a significant weekly elevation of Hb from week 8 onwards in favor of combination therapy over the ones only receiving r-HuEPO (18 +/- 1.1 g/l vs 7 +/- 1.1 g/l, P < 0.05). The initial six responders had now reached ten of whom seven belonged to the combination therapy group. Response to r-HuEPO in RA patients appears to be dependent on availability of iron and on the degree of inflammation. If r-HuEPO treatment is considered, iron deficiency should always be corrected and strenuous efforts should have been made to control the disease itself.<doc-sep>Multicenter study of recombinant human erythropoietin in correction of anemia in rheumatoid arthritis.<doc-sep>To administer recombinant erythropoietin to patients with rheumatoid arthritis who had significant anemia, while monitoring hematologic and rheumatologic clinical responses as well as potential toxicity.
                Seventeen patients with rheumatoid arthritis from five rheumatology care settings were studied. The patients had initial hematocrits of 34% or less and stable clinical status, and were not being treated with second-line drugs or corticosteroids. An 8-week randomized double-blind study involving various dosages of recombinant erythropoietin, as well as placebo, was followed by a 24-week open-label study in which dosage could be titrated to achieve a normal hematocrit.
                In the 8-week randomized study, four of 13 patients who received injections of recombinant erythropoietin showed a hematologic response, arbitrarily defined as at least a 6-unit increase in hematocrit. None of four placebo-treated patients showed a meaningful hematologic response. All 11 patients who completed the subsequent 24-week open-label study reached a normal hematocrit level at some time during the study, and 10 of 11 showed an increase of hematocrit 6 units or greater. At least one adjustment, i.e., an increase, decrease, or omission of the erythropoietin dosage, was required in all patients to maintain the hematocrit at a target range of 35% for women or 40% for men. Meaningful changes were not seen in patients' capacity to perform activities of daily living or pain levels during either the 8-week randomized study or the 24-week open-label study. No adverse effects were associated with recombinant erythropoietin therapy.
                Patients with rheumatoid arthritis showed excellent hematologic responses to recombinant erythropoietin, without toxicity, during careful monitoring for appropriate dosage adjustment, although a meaningful change in rheumatologic clinical status was not seen.<doc-sep>Effect of recombinant human erythropoietin on anaemia and disease activity in patients with rheumatoid arthritis and anaemia of chronic disease: a randomised placebo controlled double blind 52 weeks clinical trial.<doc-sep>To study whether recombinant human erythropoietin (r-hu-Epo) improves anaemia and reduces disease activity in patients with rheumatoid arthritis and anaemia of chronic disease (ACD).
                A 52 week placebo controlled randomised double blind trial with r-hu-Epo was performed in 70 patients with active rheumatoid arthritis and ACD. Thirty four patients were treated with 240 U kg-1 r-hu-Epo subcutaneously, initially three doses weekly, while 36 patients received placebo.
                A significant increase of haemoglobin from a median of 112 to 135 g litre-1 occurred in the Epo group within six weeks and could be sustained with reduced doses (median 240 U kg-1 once weekly). Sustained benefit compared to placebo was also apparent by six weeks for disease activity, as indicated by the Paulus 20% response rate. Of patients in the Epo group, 32% eventually showed a Paulus 20% response, compared to 8% of the placebo group (P = 0.016). Significant differences in favour of the Epo group were also observed in the secondary disease activity measures Ritchie index, number of swollen joints, pain score, ESR, and patients' global assessment of disease activity. C reactive protein concentrations did not change significantly.
                Treatment of ACD in rheumatoid arthritis with r-hu-Epo is effective in restoring normal haemoglobin levels and also exerts a beneficial effect on disease activity.<doc-sep>",,There is insufficient evidence to support the use of erythropoietin in the treatment of RA.,CD000332
19,"Individualised homeopathy as an adjunct in the treatment of childhood asthma: a randomised placebo controlled trial.<doc-sep>Homeopathy is frequently used to treat asthma in children. In the common classical form of homeopathy, prescriptions are individualised for each patient. There has been no rigorous investigation into this form of treatment for asthma.
                In a randomised, double blind, placebo controlled trial the effects of individualised homeopathic remedies were compared with placebo medication in 96 children with mild to moderate asthma as an adjunct to conventional treatment. The main outcome measure was the active quality of living subscale of the Childhood Asthma Questionnaire administered at baseline and follow up at 12 months. Other outcome measures included other subscales of the same questionnaire, peak flow rates, use of medication, symptom scores, days off school, asthma events, global assessment of change, and adverse reactions.
                There were no clinically relevant or statistically significant changes in the active quality of life score. Other subscales, notably those measuring severity, indicated relative improvements but the sizes of the effects were small. There were no differences between the groups for other measures.
                This study provides no evidence that adjunctive homeopathic remedies, as prescribed by experienced homeopathic practitioners, are superior to placebo in improving the quality of life of children with mild to moderate asthma in addition to conventional treatment in primary care.<doc-sep>",,There is insufficient evidence to support the use of homeopathic remedies in the treatment of asthma.,CD000353
