CD005511,,"There is insufficient evidence to support the routine use of nutritional supplements for malnourished patients with CKD. Nutritional supplementation does not appear to increase calorie intake or whole body protein intake when compared to dietary advice and/or a weight loss in the short term but the magnitude of effect may not be small and it is unclear what is the most effective means for those malnourished with CKD who do not have an abnormal protein intake of 0.6 g/kg/day and 0.75 g/day for two to three weeks. Nutritional supplements can be used to increase total protein and calorie intake without causing a significant reduction in the incidence of malnutrition due to wound infection, chest infection, or antibiotic use.
